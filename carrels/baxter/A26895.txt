The Christian religion . Expressed i. briefly , in the ancient creeds , the ten commandments , and the Lord's prayer . 

And ii more largely in a profession taken out of the holy scriptures ; containing 1.  The articles of the Christian belief . 2.  Our consent to the gospel covenant . 3.  The sum of Christian duty . 

According to the primitive simplicity , purity , and practice : fitted to the right instructing of the ignorant , the promoting of holiness , and the charitable concord of all true believers . 

Which whosoever sincerely believeth , consenteth to , and practiseth , shall certainly be saved . 

It is also by prefixed questions , made a catechism .

[ in the Christian doctrine both of faith and manners , some things are simply necessary to salvation , to all ; as the knowledge of the articles of the apostles creed , of the ten commandments , and of some sacraments : the rest are not so necessary , that a man cannot be saved without the explicit knowledge , belief and profession of them — these things that are simply necessary , and are profitable to all , the apostles preached to all — all things are written by the apostles which are necessary to all , and which they openly preaclot to all ] ( see the place . ) 

costenus enchirid. c 1. p. 49.  Non inficiamur praecipua illa fidei capita quae omnibus Christians cognitu sunt ad salutem necessaria , perspicuè satis esse apostolicis scriptis comprehensa . 

The ancient creed . i believe in God the father almighty , maker of heaven and earth : and in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord , who was conceived by the holy ghost , born of the virgin Mary ; suffered under Pontius Pilate , was crucified , dead and buried , he descended into hell ; the third day he rose again from the dead ; he ascended into heaven , and sittteth on the right hand of God the father almighty , from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead . I believe in the holy ghost ; the holy Catholic church , the communion of saints : the forgiveness of sins ; the resurrection of the body , and the life everlasting , amen . 

I believe in one God the father ▪ almighty , maker of heaven and earth , and of all things visible and invisible ; and in one Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten son of God , begotten of his father before all worlds , God of God , light of light , very God of very God , begotten not made , being of one substance with the father , by whom all things were made : who for us men , and for our salvation came down from heaven , and was incarnate by the holy ghost of the virgin Mary , and was made man , and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate . He suffered and was buried , and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures , and ascended into heaven , and sitteth at the right hand of the father ; and he shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead ; whose kingdom shall have no end and i believe in the holy ghost , the Lord and giver of life , who proceedeth from the father and the son , who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified , who spoke by the prophets . And i believe one Catholic and Apostolic church ; i acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins . And i look for the resurrection of the dead , and the life of the world to come . amen . 

Whosoever will be saved : before all things , it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith . 

Which faith except every one do keep wholly and undefiled : without doubt he shall perish everlastingly . 

And the Catholic faith is this : that we worship one God in trinity , and trinity in unity . 

Neither confounding the persons : nor dividing the substance . 

For there is one person of the father , another of the son , and another of the holy ghost . 

But the godhead of the father , of the son , and of the holy ghost , is all one : the glory equal , the majesty coeternal . 

Such as the father is , such is the son : & such is the holy ghost . 

The father uncreate , the son uncreate , and the holy ghost uncreate . 

The father incomprehensible , the son incomprehensible , and the holy ghost incomprehensible . 

The father eternal , the son eternal , and the holy ghost eternal . 

And yet they are not three eternals : but one eternal . 

As also there be not three incomprehensibles , nor three uncreated : but one uncreated , and one incomprehensible . 

So likewise the father is almighty , the son almighty , and the holy ghost almighty . 

And yet they are not three almighty's : but one almighty . 

So the father is God , the son is God , & the holy ghost is God . 

And yet they are not three gods : but one God . 

So likewise the father is Lord , the son Lord , and the holy ghost Lord . 

And yet not three Lords : but one Lord . 

For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity , to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord . 

So are we forbidden by the Catholic religion , to say there be three gods , or three Lords . 

The father is made of none : neither create , nor begotten . 

The son is of the father alone : not made , nor create , but begotten . 

The holy ghost is of the father , and of the son : neither made , nor create , nor begotten , but proceeding . 

So there is one father , not three fathers ; one son , not three sons ; one holy ghost , not three holy ghosts . 

And in this trinity none is afore or after other , none is greater or less than another . 

But the whole three persons be coeternal together , and coequal . 

So that in all things , as is aforesaid , the unity in trinity , and the trinity in unity is to be worshipped . 

He therefore that will be saved : must thus think of the trinity . 

Furthermore , it is necessary to everlasting salvation ; that he also believe rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ . 

For the right faith is , that we believe and confess : that our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God , is God and man . 

God of the substance of the father , begotten before the worlds : and man of the substance of his mother , born in the world . 

Perfect God and perfect man : of a reasonable soul , and human flesh subsisting . 

Equal to the father as touching his godhead : and inferior to the father touching his manhood . 

Who although he be God and man : yet he is not two , but one Christ . 

One , not by conversion of the godhead into flesh , but by taking of the manhood into God . 

One altogether , not by confusion of substance , but by unity of person . 

For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man : so God and man is one Christ . 

Who suffered for our salvation , descended into hell , rose again the third day from the dead . 

He ascended into heaven , and sitteth one the right hand of the father , God almighty ; from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead . 

At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies : and shall give account for their own works . 

And they that have done good , shall go into life everlasting : and they that have done evil , into everlasting fire . 

This is the Catholic faith : which except a man believe faithfully , he cannot be saved . 

The ten commandments , exod. 20.  God spoke all these words , saying , i am the Lord thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage . 

Thou shalt have no other gods before me . 

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graved image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth ; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them ; for i the Lord thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children , unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments . 

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy god in vain ; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain . 

Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy : six day's shalt thou labour , and do all thy work ; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy god ; in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maid-servant , nor thy cattle , nor the stranger that is within thy gates : for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day ; wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it . 

Honour thy father and thy mother , that thy days May be long upon the land which the Lord thy god giveth thee . 

Thou shalt not kill . 

Thou shalt not commit adultery . 

Thou shalt not steal . 

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour . 

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maid-servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbours . 

The Lord's prayer , mat. 6.  Our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name : thy kingdom come : thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven : give us this day our daily bread : and forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors ; and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil ; for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever , amen . 

The profession of the Christian religion . I. the articles of the Christian belief . It is a catechism if you prefix to every article , the question , what do you believe : 

1 there is one only God a in three persons , * the father , son and holy ghost b : who is infinite in being , power , wisdom and goodness c : the creator of all things d ; our most absolute Lord , most righteous governor , and most gracious father e . 

2 God made man for himself f in his own image g ; with reason and freewill h : endued with wisdom and holiness i ; and put under him the inferior creatures , for his use k : and bound him by the law of nature to adhere to God his maker ; to believe him , fear him , love him , honour him and obey him with all his powers l : moreover forbidding him to eat of the tree of knowledge upon pain of death M . 

3 man being tempted by Satan , did wilfully sin , and so fell from God and happiness , under the wrath of God a , the curse of his law b and the power of the devil c : and hence we are all conceived in sin , and prone to evil , d and condemnation is passed upon all e ; and no mere creature is able to deliver us f . 

4 God so loved the world that he gave his only son to be their redeemer a ; who being God , and one with the father b did take our nature , and become man ; being conceived by the holy ghost in the virgin Mary , and born of her , and called Jesus Christ c ; and being free from sin , he conquered the tempter , fulfilled all righteousness d , revealed the gospel , and confirmed it by miracles e ; and gave himself a sacrifice for our sins , and a ransom for us , in suffering death on the cross , to reconcile us unto God f ; and was buried , and went among the dead g * ) and rose again the third day , having conquered death , h ; and afterward ascended into heaven i where he remaineth God and man , in one person k , and is Lord of all , in glory with the father l ; the chief priest , and prophet , and King of his church M ; interceding for us ; and teaching and ruling us , by his spirit , ministers , and word n . 

5 the Lord Jesus Christ hath ordained in his testament , that all they that receive him by a true effectual faith , and by true repentance do turn from the flesh , the world , and the devil unto God , shall freely receive the pardon of their sins a , and shall become the sons of God , and heirs of everlasting life , b & the spirit of Christ shall dwell within them c : and all that overcome and persevere to the death , shall live with Christ in endless glory d : but the unbelievers , impenitent and unholy shall be condemned to everlasting fire e . And this he hath commanded his ministers to preach to all the world f : and hath told us , that all that are given him of the father , shall come to him , and that he will in no wise cast them out , nor shall any pluck them out of his hands . g 

6 the holy ghost proceeding from the father and the son , did inspire and guide the prophets , apostles , and evangelists , that they Might truly and fully reveal the doctrine of Christ , and deliver it in scripture to the church as the rule of our faith and life a : and by abundance of evident uncontrolled miracles , and wonderful gifts , to be the great witness of Christ , and of the truth of his holy word b . 

7 where the gospel is made known , the holy ghost by it doth enlighten the minds of all that shall be saved , and opening and softening their hearts , doth draw them to believe in Christ a and turneth them from the power of Satan unto God b : whereupon they are joined to Christ the head , and into one holy Catholic church which is his body , consisting of all true believers c : and are freely justified , and made the sons of God d ; and a sanctified peculiar persons unto him e , and do love him above all , and serve him sincerely in holiness and righteousness f , loving and desiring the communion of the saints g ; overcoming the flesh , the world and the devil h , and hoping for Christ's second coming , and for everlasting life i . 

8 at death the souls of the justified go to happiness with Christ , and the souls of the wicked to misery a : and at the end of this world the Lord Jesus Christ will come again , and will raise the bodies of all men from the dead ; and will judge all according to their works b and the righteous shall go into everlasting life , and the rest into everlasting punishment c : all this i do unfeignedly believe . 

Ii our consent to the gospel covenant , with God the father , son and holy ghost ; by which we are Christians , and members of the Catholic church . quest . are you willing and resolved to give up yourself to God the father , son and holy ghost , according to the gospel doctrine which your profess ? 

Repenting of my sins , and renouncing the flesh , the world and the devil a , i do take this one god to be my only God b , and do heartily give up myself unto him c ; even to the father , d as my creator and reconciled father in Christ : and to his son Jesus Christ , as my Lord , and only saviour , to reconcile , and bring me unto God e : and to the holy ghost as my sanctifier ; that he May further illuminate , sanctify and confirm me , and i May hold fast and obey the doctrine of Christ , which was revealed by his inspiration , and witnessed by his gifts and miracles , and is now contained in the holy scriptures ; and that he May be in me the earnest of my everlasting happiness with God f . 

Iii the sum of Christian duty . quest . what are 

1 Christ hath appointed that fit men shall be ordained his ministers , to preach the gospel to the nations of the world a , and make them his disciple , baptising them in the name of the father , son and holy ghost b : and to congregate his disciple c , and to oversee and guide the several congregations , and each member thereof d : particularly , to teach them the word of God e ; to pray and praise God with them and for them f to administer the Lord's supper in remembrance of him g ; h especially on the Lord's day , which he hath appointed for holy communion in such works i : also to rebuke with authority the scandalous and unruly k ; and to bind and reject those that are obstinately impenitent , and unreformed ; and to absolve and restore the penitent , and confirm the weak l . 

It is therefore the people's duty to join with such churches , for the aforesaid worship of God a ; and to know , hear , submit to , and obey these their guides that are over them in the Lord ; b and to avoid division and discord , and to live in unity , love and peace c . 

2 the secret duties of holiness are these : the exercise of faith , repentance , love , hope , delight in God , and all other graces a : the mortifying of our sins ; especially atheism , unbelief , and unholiness ; hardness of heart , disobedience and unthankfulness , flesh-pleasing , covetousness , and pride , b : the diligent examining of our own hearts , about our estates , our duties , and our sins c : meditating upon God , and his word and works ; especially of our redemption by Jesus Christ ; and of death , judgement , heaven , and hell d ; watching diligently over our thoughts , affections , words and actions e : resisting temptations f : and frequent and fervent prayer to God , in the name of Christ , with confession , thanksgiving , and cheerful praises g ; 

3 parents and Masters must diligently teach their children and servants , the word and fear of God a , and pray with them , and for them , and hinder them from sin b , and use all their power that they and their households May serve the Lord c : children and servants must willingly learn and obey d : we must seek instruction in the matters of our salvation , especially of our teachers e : we must take heed of the company of tempting , and ungodly persons , and delight in the company and help of the godly : we must lovingly and faithfully give , and thankfully receive admonitions and exhortations f : confessing our faults one to another g : and by prayer , psalms , and edifying conference , and a holy conversation , provoking one another to love , and to good works h . 

4 superiors must rule for God and the common good ; with justice and mercy a : inferiors must honour and obey them in the Lord b : we must not injure , but preserve the life , chastity , estate , name , and rights of our neighbour c : not seeking our own against his welfare d , but doing as we would be done by e ; forbearing and forgiving f ; and loving our neighbour as ourselves g : yea loving our enemies ; and doing good to all according to our power h . 

The agreement of the associated pastors . I. we do each one for himself , profess our resolution , in the strength of Christ , to be faithful and diligent in the works of our ministry ; and to live an holy and exemplary life , in piety , justice and charity , according to the measure of our abilities : especially watching against those sins that tend to the corrupting or dividing of the church , and to the hindering of our ministry ; and to the dishonour of the gospel , and of our holy profession . 

Ii we do profess our agreement and resolution in the strength of Christ , to be faithful and diligent in public preaching the gospel : and in the personal instructing of all in our parishes , or undertaken limits , that will submit thereto ; teaching the ignorant the principles of religion ; endeavouring in love , compassion and meekness , and yet with seriousness and zeal , to convince the erroneous and opposers , to awaken the presumptuous and secure , and help them to try the state of their souls , and to see and feel their sin and misery , and return to God by Christ that they May live : to strengthen the weak ; to raise the fallen ; to edify and confirm the strong ; and to comfort such as need consolation ; and to help them all to prepare for death and judgement , and for everlasting life : and all this , as frequently , constantly and orderly , as our strength , and time , and greater duties will permit . 

Iii that the churches May be capable of the discipline of Christ , and constituted and ruled according to the word of God , and the ends of our office and labours May be attained , we are agreed and resolved to take none for adult members of the churches committed to our special charge , nor admit them , as such , to church-communion and privileges , but those that have first made some personal credible profession of true Christianity , that is , of faith and obedience , and as members of those churches , submit to our pastoral oversight according to the word of God . But all that make this profession of Christianity and consent to live in communion with the church , and under the ministry and discipline of Christ , we shall receive , though they be weak in knowledge , and utterance , and duties ; and shall faithfully employ our ministerial abilities and care for their edification and salvation . 

Iv. we are agreed and resolved in the strength of Christ , while we have ability and opportunity , to congregate the persons , and hold constant assemblies , especially on the lords-days ; and therein faithfully to perform the works of our office , in reading the holy scripture , preaching , praying , baptising , praising God , celebrating the sacrament of the Lord's supper , and guiding the persons in the whole public worship of God : and to manage our work with as much prudence , and reverence , and love , and compassion to the people's souls , and with as much plainness and convincing evidence , authority , seriousness , and zealous importunity as we can : avoiding as far as we are able , such things as corrupt and dishonour God's ordinances , and tend to corrupt the people's minds with error , presumption , deadness , negligence , or other distempers , displeasing to the Lord . 

V. for the ends of our office , in obedience to the Lord , we agree and resolve in the strength of Christ , to exercise so much of church-government and discipline , in the churches committed to our charge , as we discern to be our certain duty ; that is , to keep order and decency in the holy assemblies , and see that all be done to edification : convicting seducers , and stopping the mouths of perverse gainsayers ; overseeing the several members of our charge ; and requiring them to walk obediently to Christ , and do their duties towards each other : to reprove the gross and scandalous offenders : and if they continue impenitent or unreformed , to tell the church , or rebuke them before all ; ( And publicly pray for their recovery ) : and if they hear not the church , but remain impenitent and unreformed , after sufficient reproof and patience , to put away such persons from among us , declaring against them the threatenings of the Lord , and requiring them to forbear communion with the church , and requiring the church to avoid them , and have no familiarity or communion with them , as persons unmeet for the communion of saints . And those that credibly profess repentance , we are to absolve ministerially in the name of Christ , and comfort with the promises of grace ; receiving them , and requiring the persons to receive them , as brethren , into their communion : but warning them to watch and sin so no more , lest worse befall them . This holy discipline , by the help of God , we shall exercise faithfully and impartially , but yet with caution and moderation ; neglecting no necessary consultations with other pastors , or concurrence of the church : and consenting to be responsible for maladministrations . 

Vi . For the communion of churches , and the strengthening ourselves for the work of God , and helping one another therein , and maintaining unity , love and concord ; we do consent to hold a brotherly communion and correspondency : and to that end , when necessity or greater duty hindereth us not , we shall meet at such convenient times and places , as shall be appointed or agreed on from time to time ; and shall labour to improve these meetings to our mutual edification , in such consultations , conferences or other holy exercises , as our present case shall most require . And we consent to deal faithfully in advising and admonishing one another ; and for the satisfaction of the brethren ( To the forementioned ends ) to be responsible , if any shall charge us with heresy , scandal , schism , or maladministration : and forbearing matters without our line , to study and endeavour the promoting of truth , and holiness , and unity among ourselves , and with other churches , as we have a call . 

And also we agree by communicatory letters upon all needful occasions , to certify our brethren and other churches of the state of our affairs , and of particular members , that those that justly have communion in one church , or are excluded , May have communion with other churches , or be refused by them accordingly , when there is just occasion . 

And if any brethren or churches be prevailed over so far by temptation , as unjustly to deny us their communion , in this way of association , assemblies , or correspondency , we shall not therefore deny them to be our brethren , or churches of Christ , but shall love and own them , and have so much communion with them , as their distance shall leave them capable of , if they join with us in the profession and practice of true Christianity , and of the points that are necessary to church-constitution and communion , and are not proved guilty of heresy , ungodliness , or such kind of schism or scandalous sins , for which the scripture commandeth us to reject men , and avoid them . But such as are thus guilty ( Though they offer themselves to associate with us ) we shall refuse to hold communion with , till they credibly profess repentance , and manifest a reformation . 

Vii . Because it is a matter of great concernment to the honour of Christ , the propagation of the gospel , and the increase and welfare of the church , that there be a provision of able , faithful ministers , and that unworthy persons be kept out ; and because deceivers and unworthy men are forward to intrude , and the persons ordinarily are insufficient of themselves to make such trial of men's ability and soundness as is requisite to the safety of the church ; and the church in all ages hath received ministers by the ordination of other ministers of Christ : we do therefore agree to be careful and faithful in the discharge of our duties hereabout , so far as we can discern them , resolving that if any vacant church desire us to recommend a fit person to be their pastor , or to judge of any recommended to them , we will not recommend or approve of any , but such as we judge most agreeable to the will of Christ ; nor will we prefer less fit and worthy men , for friendship or any carnal interest or respect . And if any intolerably unworthy person be about to intrude , or have intruded , or any neighbour church be about to choose , or have chosen such , if we have opportunity , we shall faithfully acquaint them with their sin and danger , and persuade them to a better course . And if we shall be called to invest any by solemn ordination in the sacred office of the ministry , we shall perform it , as near as we are able , according to the directions of the word of God ; admitting none that Christ excludeth : and if it May be , we shall do it in that congregation which the person is to oversee , that so we May the better discern their mutual consent , inculcate their duties , and engage them to a faithful performance thereof . 

And whereas it is much controverted of late , whether the power of ordination be given to the persons , or the pastors of a particular church , or the associated neighbour pastors , and whether a stated precedent among these should not have a negative voice herein ; we are agreed , that leaving the persons their due liberty of consent in the reception of their proper pastors , we will none of us singly ordain , without the assistance of other pastors : nor will we join with any heretics or others , in unjust and impious ordinations , that tend to the corrupting or dividing of the churches . 

And to avoid division upon a tolerable difference of opinions , where we May agree in practice , we consent that the associations that have no stated precedents , or that give not to such a negative voice , shall receive into their communion those that are of the contrary opinion ; giving them leave , if they desire it , to profess or record their opinion in that particular , so they will afterward walk among them in love and peace . And that the associations that choose a stated precedent , and give him a negative voice in ordination , shall in like manner , and on like terms , receive into their communion , such as dissent in that particular , and having professed or recorded their dissent , will walk submissively in love and peace . Which liberty also of professing and recording their different principles , we desire May be allowed them , that join in synods , as being only for communion of churches , and them that join in them , as having a direct superior governing power over the particular pastors of the churches . 

Viii . Though it be the surest way to peace and concord , to take up with these necessary things , and we cannot approve of the narrow dividing principles of those men that will impose things unnecessary , to the excluding of the necessary ; yet if our lawful rulers shall command it , or the peace of the church , through the distempers of the brethren shall require it , we shall obey , and consent in things that God hath not forbidden ; and if we suffer for well-doing , and for obeying god rather than men , we shall endeavour to imitate our Lord , who being reviled , reviled not again , and when he suffered , threatened not ; but committed all to him that judgeth righteously , 1 pet. 2. 23.  

The office of Christ's ministers more largely opened . 1.  The Lord Jesus Christ having purchased our salvation by his blood , and established his testament or covenant of grace , and left us his example of perfect holiness , ascended to the father , and is there the glorified Lord of all , and head over all things to his church , all power being given him in heaven and earth ; that interceding for us with the father , he Might be the treasury of our light and life ; and offering salvation to the miserable world , Might gather , and cleanse , and save the church , which is his body ; communicating to them that grace that is here necessary to them , in their way and warfare , and perfecting them in glory with himself , when their warfare is accomplished . 

2.  Christ being thus invisible to us , in glory with the father , performeth not these works below , by himself in person , immediately and alone ; but by his spirit , ministers , and word . The holy ghost being his advocate or agent to these ends ; and his ministers the instruments used by his spirit and himself : to indite and bear witness to his word , and to preach it to the world , as that infallible truth which must guide them to salvation . 

3.  The first prophetical and apostolical ministers , being sent by himself , and qualified by the inspiration , conduct and miraculous gifts of the holy ghost , did found the church , and enlarge it unto many nations of the world , and left them the holy scriptures , which contain the doctrine which they preached , that it Might be certainly and fully preserved , and propagated till the coming of Christ . And they settled by the appointment of Christ and his spirit , an ordinary ministry to succeed them , not to deliver a new law or gospel , but to preserve and preach the doctrine which in the holy scriptures ( And conjunctly at first also from the mouths of the apostles ) they had received as once delivered to the saints , and to guide the churches by it to the end . 

4.  Though Christ appointed ministers that should have so far a charge or care of the whole church , as not to be limited to any one part , but to extend their labour and oversight , as far as their capacity and opportunities would permit : yet did he never make any man his vicar or vicegerent , as head of the universal church : nor lay upon any one , whether Peter , Paul , or any other , the charge and oversight of the whole : nor did ever Peter or any one apostle exercise such an office , in governing all the Catholic church : especially when it ceased to be confined to Jerusalem and the adjacent parts , and was dispersed through the world . Never did the apostles receive their commissions from Peter : or all the ministers then in the world , perform their work by his commission , or by any power received from him , nor were accountable to him , and judged by him for what they did . Much less is this universal head-ship , committed to the Pope of Rome through all ( Or any ) generations : but because a certain primacy of order was granted him by Emperors and councils , within the limits of the Roman empire , long after the apostles days : therefore doth he take advantage thence , to pretend a title to the universal head-ship : as if the Roman and the Christian world had been the same ; or the Emperor and his clergy had been the rulers of all the Christian subjects of all other Princes or pastors upon earth : and his limited primacy had been an universal sovereignty . This claim of the Pope of Rome to be the Vice-christ , or universal pastor of all the Christian world , is a tyrannical , impious , irrational usurpation ; contrary to the holy scripture , and the state of the primitive church , and contrary to nature and common sense , which declare his incapacity of the work ; far more than any Prince is uncapable of being the universal monarch of the world ; and therefore all Christians should abhor this proud and impious usurpation , and fly from the guilt of that horrible schism , and those corruptions in doctrine , worship and government , which it hath introduced . 

5.  Christ calleth his ordinary ministers to that office , by enduing them with his gifts , and disposing them thereunto , and moving the hearts of the persons to consent , and by ordination of the senior pastors ; and giving them opportunities for the work : and sometime the magistrates command hath a hand in the obligation . 

6.  It belongeth to the office of the ministers of Christ to preach the gospel to the nations of the world , and make them Christ's disciple , baptising them in the name of the father , the son , and the holy ghost . 

7.  This preaching or publishing the gospel , is done by voice or by writing : that by voice , is done by reading , by public sermons , or interlocutory conference : that by writing is either by translating the holy scriptures into the languages used by the nations , or by expounding and applying them . So that the holy scriptures in the original languages , are the word of God , both as to the terms and sense grammatical and doctrinal : the same scriptures in a translation are the word of God as to the sense , both grammatical and doctrinal ; but not as to the terms : the holy doctrine of the scriptures delivered in the writings , and sermons , and conferences of the preachers of the gospel , is the word of God , as to the doctrinal sense ; but not as to the terms or grammatical sense , except when they recite the scripture words , as in the original or translated . 

8.  Baptism is a holy sacrament instituted by Christ , in which a person professing the Christian faith ( Or the infant of such a professor ) is ( Regularly by a minister of Christ ) baptised in water into the name of the father , the son , and the holy ghost , in signification and solemnization of the holy covenant , in which as a penitent believer ( Or the seed of such ) he giveth up himself ( Or is by the parent given up ) to God the father , son and holy ghost , from henceforth ( Or from the time of natural capacity ) to believe in , love , and serve this blessed trinity , against the flesh , the world , and devil , and this especially on the account of redemption : and ( If he sincerely make this covenant ) is solemnly entered a member of Christ and his church , a justified reconciled child of God , and an heir of heaven : all which , with the other present benefits of the covenant , he is hereby instated ( Or invested ) in ; they being thus solemnly delivered to him by the promise thus sealed , and applied by an appointed minister of Christ . 

Or if some of us doubt whether these special benefits of the covenant are delivered thus to all the infants that are sincerely dedicated unto God ; yet we are all agreed , that they are assured to them as soon as they believe : and in the interim of their incapacity , they have a general promise that God will be their God , and his mercy shall be to them . 

9  It is a notable part of the ministerial office to baptise : and consequently to try and judge of their profession who are thus solemnly to be admitted into the church , and estated by baptism in these benefits : therefore hath Christ given the keys of his kingdom to their trust , both that his holy church May be preserved from the unjust intrusions of uncapable persons : and that the faithful Covenanters May have the fuller consolation , by receiving a sealed promise and pardon , from the hand of a minister of Christ , commanded by him to seal and deliver it in his name . 

10.  We are persuaded that it is the will of Christ that the infants of the faithful shall be dedicated to him in baptism , and engaged in his covenant , and made members of his visible church , because we find that under the promise before Christ's incarnation it was their duty to devote and engage their children to God in the holy covenant , and that God did accept them as visible members of his church ; and we never find where Christ had discharged parents from this duty , or turned all infants out of his church , and reversed this blessing of their church-membership ; but contrarily we find him offering to have taken the Jewish nation to be still his church , if they would have taken him for their saviour ; and telling us that it was for unbelief , that they were broken off ; and that it is but some of the branches that were broken off , and we are graffed in amongst them into the same olive-tree , and that all Israel shall be saved , when the fullness of the gentiles is come in ; and we find Christ rebuking his disciple for hindering little children from being offered to him , and that he charged them to forbid it no more , and that he received and blessed them himself , and tells us that of such is the kingdom of God ; and we find it the commission given to his ministers , that they were to disciple the nations , baptising them . All which , and much more ( Especially having not the least intimation of his will against that which was even then the duty and practice of the parents , and the infant's benefit ) do deter us from forbidding the dedication of children unto Christ , and receiving them into his church by baptism . 

11.  Baptism being so great a work , should be deliberately , seriously and reverently performed , if it May be , publicly before the church , where the person ( Or parent ) should make their solemn profession , and be received with the joy and prayers of the church ; whether infant or adult . 

12.  The Catholic church consisteth of all the Christians in the world : those that have the sanctifying spirit of Christ are the living members : those that openly profess Christianity , and enter into covenant with Christ , and are not yet baptised , are visible members initially , but the solemnization and investiture is defective ; if it be where baptism cannot be had , the defect is innocent ; if where it May be had , it is sinful : but yet not such as nullifieth the persons visible Christianity . And no errors , offences or differences do exclude any totally from the Catholic church , while all the essentials of Christianity are kept . 

13.  It is the will of Christ that all Christians that have opportunity , be members of some particular church , as well as of the universal : that he May have the honour , and they the great and necessary benefits , that by the ministry , ordinances and communion of saints , is there to be expected . 

14.  A particular Christian church , is [ a competent number of Christians cohabiting , who by the appointment of Christ , and their own expressed consent , are united ( Or associated ) under one or more pastors , for the right worshipping of God in public , and the edification of the members , in knowledge and holiness , and the maintaining of their obedience to Christ , for the safety , strength and beauty of the society , and thereby the glorifying and pleasing of the Lord . ] It is a political organised society , that is here defined , and not a mere community that is incapable of the sacraments and other ordinances , and the benefits of them , for want of overseers . 

15.  Those ministers that are placed in parishes , where are many sorts of persons , some ignorant of the essentials of Christianity , some apostates , some impious and of wicked lives , and some that consent not to be members of their pastoral charge , should teach them all that will submit and learn : for we are called to it by the magistrate and obliged by the public maintenance which we receive to that end ; and engaged by the general command of improving our talents , and the special opportunity that we have thereunto . 

16.  This teaching of all our parishioners that will submit , must be both personally and publicly , as far as we have ability and opportunity . The former must be by catechising , and conference ; wherein we must teach them first the essential points of Christianity , and labour to help them to the clearest understanding of the doctrine of salvation ; and press it on their affections , and help them to discern their sin and misery , and do all that we can to procure their conversion or edification , according to their several states ; managing the whole work with those holy affections , that the weight of it doth require . 

17.  The great necessity of our neighbours , and the advantages of this familiar way , do tell us that this work of catechising and conference is so great a part of our duty , that we should do it with much diligence , prudence and constancy . And the general precepts of doing all to edification and in order , oblige us ordinarily to appoint a stated time and place where every family May come in order ; and if we are able we should go to them , that cannot or will not come to us , if they will but hear us . 

18.  Those that are baptised in infancy , and there engaged to God in the holy covenant , should with all possible care and diligence , be educated by the parents , or any that have the tuition of them , in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , and taught betimes to know the doctrine of the gospel , and to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ , and to love God above all , and their neighbours as themselves , and to hate iniquity , and live to God , and first to seek his kingdom and righteousness ; to which end parents should catechise their children , and daily be teaching them the word of God , and acquainting them with his fear and holy worship . And ministers must with special care and diligence oversee the several families of their charge , and excite the parents to this necessary duty . And also should themselves assist them herein , and catechise such youth ( As well as all others that are ignorant ) as often as they can ; especially where parents do neglect it . 

19  As infants are by baptism admitted among the infant-members of the church , upon their parent's profession of Christianity , and dedicating them to God ; so must they personally make a profession of their own faith , and own their baptismal covenant , and give up themselves to God the father , son and holy ghost , before they are to be admitted into the number and communion of the adult members of the church ; which profession is to be tried and approved of by the pastors of the church : and so excellent a duty , to be carefully , and seriously , and solemnly performed , that the transition into the state and communion of the adult , May appear to be so great and observable a thing , as May excite all to an answerable care and diligence , in preparation thereunto , and to look after that saving faith and holiness , which they must so solemnly profess . And ministers should have a special care , that they take nothing for a credible profession , that is not so : and corrupt not the church by letting in uncapable members , that must either be cast out again , to the grievous exasperating them against the church and way of God , and so to the apparent hazard of their souls : or else must live ungoverned in their wickedness , to the great dishonour of God , and the provocation of his wrath against them and the church . 

20.  For the public worshipping of God , and our own edification , the pastors , where there is opportunity , must congregate the persons in a solemn assembly in a convenient place and time . And all that can must constantly there attend , preferring the public worship of God before the private : much more before their worldly businesses , that are not of flat necessity to themselves or others . 

21.  In these public assemblies it is lawful for us to admit , even , infidels to be present , and such catechumens as are yet unfit to be members of the church , and there to teach , reprove and exhort them , and pray for them according to their state : though we May not receive them to be members of the church , nor admit them to our special communion . 

22.  Because it is the holy scriptures that contain that gospel of which we are ministers ; and because the honour of God's holy word is to be preserved , and the persons to be instructed in it , and taught to know it ; it is therefore our duty in the solemn assemblies to read the word of God to the persons , in a known tongue ; ( As Moses and the prophets were read every Sabbath day in the synagogues of the Jews . ) Such portions being chosen , and order observed , as the pastors discern to be most for edification . 

23.  Our public preaching of the gospel should be from faith and holy experience , with plainness , and perspicuity , with reverence and gravity , with convincing evidence and authority , with fervent zeal , and persuading importunity , with the tenderest love and melting compassion , with faithfulness , impartiality and prudence , suiting both matter and manner to the necessity of the hearers , and with frequency and unwearied patience , waiting on God for the success . 

24.  The pastor is to lead , and the persons to consent and join in heart in the public prayers , and unanimously to pour out their souls unto the Lord in penitent confession of sin , and fervent petition , and joyful thanksgiving and praise : and this according to the direction of the holy scriptures ; and especially of the Lord's prayer : which is the most perfect , comprehensive summary , form and pattern of our prayers . 

25.  Confession is to be made , both of our own sin , and the sins of the church and nation , of magistrates , ministers and persons : yet so as that we turn it not into a reproaching and dishonouring of our superiors , or an abusing of men's persons , by venting our malice or distempered passions , or uncharitable censures against them ; we must confess our original and actual sin : the great corruption of our hearts and lives : our sinful thoughts , affections , words and actions : our privative and positive sin : out omissions and commissions : our secret and unknown sins in general , and our known and open sins by name : our sins of ignorance , and sins against knowledge : our sins before and since conversion : our sins against the Lord himself , consisting in our unholiness , contrary to the first table ; and our unjustice and uncharitableness against our neighbour ; and our folly and injury against ourselves : the sins of our relations , and of our more private life : our sins against the light and law of nature ; and our sins against the gospel and grace of a redeemer : against the outward means of grace , and against the inward motions of the spirit , and of our consciences : against mercies and judgements : against the examples of Christ and his servants , and the warning-falls of others ; especially those sins by which we have most dishonoured God and our holy profession ; and have most scandalised , hardened or tempted others : and all our confessions should proceed from true contrition and hatred of the sin . 

26.  Our petitions must be only for things agreeable to the revealed will of God : and principally for the hallowing of his name , and the coming of his kingdom , and the doing of his will , in earth , as it is in heaven : and therefore we must have compassionate thoughts of the dark and miserable parts of the world , where by heathenism , infidelity and Mahometanism , the name of God is grievously dishonoured , and his sovereignty denied or rejected , and Satan's kingdom doth prevail , and where the will of God is partly unknown , and partly wilfully disobeyed : and our eye and heart must be on the state of the universal church , that all this interest of God-in-christ , May be there preserved and advanced . And in order to these blessed ends , we must beg such necessaries of our life , as the supportation of our natures for the work of God requireth : and the forgiveness of all our sins through Christ ( Which yet we cannot expect to receive , if we from our hearts forgive not others : ) and a gracious preservation from temptations , or the power of them , and from Satan and sin the greatest evils : that so the holiness of our hearts and lives May show that we are the loyal subjects of the kingdom of our Lord , and that we acknowledge and magnify his sovereign power , and live as a persons devoted to his glory . And all this we must beg in an humble sense of our great unworthiness , misery , necessity and insufficiency to help ourselves ; and in the name of Christ , in understanding and faith ( And therefore not in a tongue that we understand not ) and with fervency and uncessant importunity , as directed , excited and strengthened by the spirit of Christ . 

27.  Our thanksgiving unto God must not be like the Pharisees , in hypocrisy and pride , or to make ostentation of things that we never had , but in humility and holy joyfulness of mind , we must declare our thankfulness , for our creation , redemption , justification and reconciliation with God , our sanctification , and all the parts thereof , and helps thereunto : for the gospel and ministry ; and the plantation , preservation and propagation of the church thereby : for common and special works of providence , for the good of the church , our brethren or ourselves : for mercy's ordinary or extraordinary : spiritual or corporal : for prevention of evils , or removing them : for the quality and degree , the suitableness and seasonableness of all our mercies , with the rest of their aggravations : especially for those that most promote our everlasting happiness , and the public good and glory of the Lord . 

28.  The matter of our holy praises of the Lord , must be his blessed and infinite being and nature , and all his attributes : his infinite power , and wisdom , and goodness : his truth , and holiness , and love : his absolute dominion , his sovereignty , and fatherly benignity : his justice and his mercy : even as they are revealed in the works of the creation , and in the glass of the holy scripture , and in the person of Jesus Christ , and in the image of God upon his saints : and all these his works also must be praised in subserviency to his praise . And because it is a most high and excellent duty to praise the Lord , we must strive to do it with all the faith , and reverence , and admiration , and love , and delight , and joy , and cheerfulness that possibly we can attain : and this with constancy as our daily work , with our eye on heaven , where we shall do it in perfection to all eternity . 

29.  As the holy scriptures should be read in a tongue that the persons understand , so should the purest exactest translation of them be used that can be had : and though it be not of absolute necessity to the communion or peace of the churches ; yet it is to be desired and endeavoured , that all neighbour churches that are of one language do all agree in the use of that one translation . 

30.  Though in cases of necessity the gospel May be publicly expounded and applied by the reading of the expositions and sermons of others , yet as it is meet that the preachers of the gospel be able to perform this work themselves ; by the abilities given them from God , in the use of just and edifying means ; so it is meet that by diligent studying , meditation and prayer , these abilities be improved ; and that from this holy and spiritual treasure within them , the ministers of Christ do draw forth sound explication , with pertinent lively application of the truth . 

31.  So also in the public prayers , though it be lawful ( In itself ) to read the words of prayer prescribed us by others ; yet as all ministers should be able to pray themselves from the knowledge and feeling of their own and the people's wants , so it is meet that their graces and holy abilities be ordinarily exercised in such prayer , and that they be not restrained from speaking to God in such sound and meet expressions , as shall either presently , or by the means of their preparations , proceed from the sense of the matter of their prayers , excited and drawn forth by the assistance of the spirit of Christ . But whether any particular pastor should use a stinted form of words imposed by others , or invented by himself , or whether he shall pray without such stinted forms , or both , by turns , is a point to be determined according to his own abilities , and the state of his flock , and other accidents : but it is not to be made a matter of such necessity in itself , as to lay the unity or peace of the churches , or the liberty of the pastors and worshippers of Christ upon it . 

32.  The public praises of God must be expressed by the pastor in such words as are produced by that holy knowledge , faith , admiration , love and delight , with which his soul should be possessed that is so nigh to God ; and also by the recitation of sacred psalms and hymns , and by the cheerful singing of such by the church : wherein the melody must be spiritually , and not carnally used : for the assisting of our souls in the exercise of that holy alacrity and joy that is required in so high a work ; and not to draw off our minds from the matter , nor to stop at the pleasing of our ears . Such psalms also May be recited or sung , as contain matter of confession of sin , petition , thanksgiving , and such narratives as tend to praise . 

33.  The form of words to be said and sung , must be taken especially out of the holy scriptures : to which use we have the psalms of David and other hymns : and also we May use such as have been or shall be composed by wise and holy men , agreeable to the doctrine of the scripture , and fuited to the gospel frame of worship , and as far as May be , even in scripture phrase . And though it be not meet to insist upon a concord in lesser things , when it cannot be attained without the violation of concord in greater things ; yet is it much to be desired and endeavoured that all the churches of the same language ( Especially that are near and in the same dominions ) should agree in using the same psalms and hymns for matter and metre ; and that the version so agreed on , be the best that they can have . 

34.  The eucharist or supper of the Lord is [ a holy sacrament instituted by Christ , wherein bread and wine being first by consecration made sacramentally or representatively the body and blood of Christ , they are used by breaking and pouring out , to represent and commemorate the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood upon the cross , once offered up to God for sin : and are given in the name of Christ unto the church , to signify and solemnize the renewal of his holy covenant with them , and sealing it unto them , and the giving of himself to them to expiate their sins by his sacrifice , and sanctify them further by his spirit , and confirm their right to everlasting life : and they are received , eaten and drunk by the church , to profess that they willingly receive Christ himself to the ends aforesaid , ( Their justification , sanctification and glorification ) and to signify and solemnize the renewal of their covenant with him , and their holy communion with him , and with one another . ] 

35.  The sacrament of the Lord's supper containeth in it these three parts . 1.  The consecration of the bread and wine . 2.  The representation and commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ . 3.  And the giving to , and participation by the church . The consecration hath chief respect unto God the father : the representation and commemoration to the son as sacrificed : and the giving and participation , to the applying operations of the holy ghost . As it must first be the body and blood of Christ before it be sacrificed , and first offered in sacrifice to God , before it is offered for nourishment and salvation unto men ; so is it in the order of sacramental representation . 

36.  The consecration is performed by the churches offering up the creatures of bread and wine to God to be accepted to this holy use : and by God's acceptance of them , as dedicated thereunto . The church's dedication is expressed by the present action , and God's acceptance is expressed by his command and promise , and the ministerial acception and benediction . The minister in this action is the agent of the persons in offering or dedicating these creatures unto God , and he is God's agent or minister in receiving and blessing them . 

37.  In this dedication of the bread and wine to God to be the consecrate matter of the commemorative representative sacrifice , the church acknowledgeth the three grand relations of God to his persons . 1.  We acknowledge him the creator and owner of all the creatures . 2.  We acknowledge him our righteous sovereign ruler , whose law we have offended , and who hath received the atonement , and whose laws we do herein obey . And , 3.  We acknowledge him our father , or bounteous benefactor , by whom we are sustained , and whose love we have forfeited , and with whom we desire by Christ to be reconciled . 

38.  This consecration maketh not the bread to be no bread , or the wine to be no longer wine ; nor doth it make any addition to , or change upon the glorified real body of Christ ; but it maketh the bread to be sacramentally Christ's body ; and the wine to be sacramentally his blood ; that is representatively : as an actor in a tragedy is the person whom he representeth : or as in investitures , a sword is the honour of knighthood , or a key is the house , or a twig or turf is the land . 

39  Because Christ was to be invisible to us , and the heavens must receive him till the restoration of all things , therefore as he hath sent his spirit within to be his agent in his members ; so hath he appointed his ordinances without , and especially this visible solemn representation and commemoration of his sacrifice ; that our faith Might hereby be helped , and our souls Might be raised to such apprehensions of his love and the mercy of our redemption , as if we had even seen him crucified before our eyes , and this till his glorious return , when we shall enjoy him visibly in his glory . 

40.  As Christ in his intercession , as our high priest in the heavens , procureth and conveyeth his benefits of salvation upon the account of his sacrifice once offered on the cross ; so doth the church in this commemoration , present him unto God the father , as the sacrificed lamb , in whom they profess themselves to believe , and by whom alone they expect salvation , and all the blessings tending thereunto . 

41.  In this commemoration the minister is chiefly the agent of Christ , in representing his voluntary offering up himself unto the father in sacrifice for sin : and he is the agent of the persons , in that part of the commemoration , in which they profess their believing in a crucified Christ , and thankfulness for him , and dependence on him as their hope . 

42.  Jesus Christ having finished the work of redemption , which he was to do on earth , in the days of his flesh , ascended and is glorified with the father , and being become the perfect head and treasure of the church , hath in his testament or new covenant made a free gift of himself and life to all that will receive him as he is offered ; and he hath appointed his ministers not only to proclaim this gift unto the world , but also in his name to deliver it to the church : and it is a great encouragement and comfort to believers , that it is a minister or agent of Christ himself , that by his command , and in his name doth say to them [ take ye , eat ye , this is my body which is broken for you . ] And [ this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for you , drink ye all of it ] ; Christ himself with his saving benefits , being herewith as truly offered to their faith , as the signs and representations are offered to their hands and mouths . Though it be still but ( Consecrate ) bread and wine that doth represent , yet is it the very body and blood of Christ that is represented ; and Christ himself as the head of the church , and fountain of our renewed life , and as our spiritual nourishment , that is truly given us , and received by us . 

43.  It is therefore unmeet for any but a lawful minister of Christ , who is authorised hereunto , to administer this holy sacrament : both because no other are called to it in the holy scripture , nor can show any warrant for such an undertaking ; and because it is very injurious to the comfort of the church , when they know not that the person hath any authority to deliver them so great a mercy from the Lord , nor whether Christ will own his ministration . 

44.  The ministers must partake of this holy sacrament with the church : not as they are the agents of Christ for the delivery of it , but as they themselves are his disciple and members of the church . 

45.  Before the receiving of this holy sacrament we ought to examine ourselves , that we May come preparedly with repentance for all known sin , and faith in Christ , and an humble feeling of our own necessities , and a thankful sense of the love of God expressed in our redemption by Christ , and a hungering and thirsting after him and his righteousness , and with an unfeigned love unto our brethren , and a high estimation of the union and communion of the saints , and with a resolution to walk in holy obedience to God , in patient hope of the coming of Christ , and of the everlasting kingdom , where we shall be perfectly in him united : which holy affections are also to be exercised in the time of our communion in this sacrament , and afterwards upon the review of what we have here received and done . 

46.  The word and prayer must be joined with the sacrament . The nature and use of it must be opened , and the persons excited to the exercise of the duties before mentioned . Sin must be confessed and lamented , and mercy implored , and thankfully acknowledged , and the goodness of God , especially manifested in the work of our redemption , must with the greatest admiration , alacrity and joy that we can attain to , be magnified and praised , till this unspeakable love of God in Christ hath drawn out our hearts in fervent love to him again . And it will be most suitable to this eucharistical ordinance , that the church do sing some psalm or hymn of praise to God , for the mercies of our redemption . 

47.  Those are to be invited to the supper of the Lord that have these necessary qualifications , in some degree , and the rest to be acquainted with the danger of eating and drinking unworthily . Those only are to be admitted to the table of the Lord that have the use of reason , and can examine themselves , and are members of the church , and have made a personal credible profession of faith and holiness , and are not justly , for heresy or any scandalous sin , removed from present communion with the church . 

48.  The using or not using of forms of prayer in the administration of this sacrament , is to be determined of , as aforesaid in the other parts of worship , according to the different abilities of ministers , and state of the several congregations , and other accidents that should weigh in such indifferent things . But as in the administration of baptism , it is ordinarily meetest and most safe , to use the express form of words which Christ hath directed us to , and the church hath still used , viz. [ i baptise thee in the name of the father , son and holy ghost ] : so in the administration of the sacrament of the Lord's supper , it is safest and meetest that we use the words that Christ by his example hath directed us to use . As matth. 26. 26 , 27 , 28.  Luk. 22. 19 , 20. 1 cor. 11. 24 , 25. viz. [ take ye , eat ye , this is my body which is broken for you , this do in remembrance of me ] and [ this is the blood of Christ , even of the new testament ( Or this is the new testament in the blood of Christ ) which is shed for many for the remission of sins ; drink ye all of it in remembrance of him . ] 

49.  As it is not unmeet for the church at other times when they assemble , to make a solemn profession of the Christian faith and of holy obedience , to manifest their constancy therein ; and to declare what doctrine it is that we assemble to profess , and to preserve it in the minds of all ; so is it more especially meet , that at baptism and the Lord's supper , when we are solemnly to renew our covenant with the Lord , the Covenanters do renew this solemn profession : to which end it is most safe to make use of the ancient forms of confession , called , the apostles creed , and the Nicene creed ; and also to recite the ten commandments , with a profession of our consent to the terms of the covenant with God the father , son and holy ghost . To which if we ( At lest sometimes ) adjoin some fuller explication of the creed and decalogue ( Such as is our profession here before set down ) it will not be unprofitable or unmeet . And in such manner it May all be managed , and such signs or expressions of consent required , as the pastors shall judge meet for the attainment of the desired ends , with liberty for such variations , as are necessary to prevent a dead formality . 

50.  At the dismission of the assembly , it is meet that the pastor do solemnly bless them in the name of Christ , to which he is authorised as an act of his ministerial office . 

51.  Deacons are church-officers instituted by the holy ghost to be serviceable to the pastors and the church , by the distribution of the creatures dedicated to the church-communion , and taking care for the supplying of the necessities of the poor , out of the contributions or stock of the church . 

52.  The first day of the week is appointed or separated by the holy ghost for the holy assemblies and public worship of the church and other holy exercises ; and is herein to be improved to the honour of God , and the edification of ourselves and others : and all other employments are therein to be avoided that any way hinder the holy duties of the day ; except such as become a greater duty , upon the account of piety , justice or mercy . That some stated time be separated to the public service of God and the benefit of our souls , is a thing that the law of nature doth command ; that this stated time should be at least one day in seven , the reason and equity ( At least ) of the fourth commandment doth acquaint us : that this day should be every first day of the week , the holy ghost in the new testament hath revealed to us ; acquainting us with Christ's rising on that day ( Which laid the foundation of the change ) and of the assembling of his disciple on that day , and his owning their assembly by his appearing to them , and teaching them , and blessing them , and giving them their commission and the holy ghost , joh. 20. 19 , to 24.  The same they did the next first day , where he again appeared and owned their assembly , and revealed himself unto them , joh. 20. 26 , 27.  And that this was the practice of the apostles and the primitive Christian churches directed by them , appeareth act. 20. 7 , 8. 1 cor. 16. 1 , 2. so that it was called the Lord's day , as the last day before was called the Sabbath , rev. 1. 10.  And to put us out of all doubt of the matter of fact , and consequently of the meaning of these texts of scripture ; the certain tradition and most concordant history of the church assureth us , that ever since the days of the apostles , the universal church in all parts of the world , hath constantly observed the Lord's day in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ : which it is not possible that they could have done , without contradiction and rebukes from the apostles themselves or some of the churches which they planted , if it had not been a certain truth . Those therefore that will be against the holy observation of the Lord's day , must either impudently deny the testimony of all church history and tradition , which with one consent assure us that it was observed universally in the Christian churches from the apostles days , as a thing by them established and practised ; or else they must imagine that all the dispersed churches through the world conspired in the teaching and practising of such an error without any known rebuke , wherein it had been most easy for any to have convicted them to be slanderers of the apostles , or the ages that were before them . Having therefore so much in nature , in the fourth commandment , in the new testament , and the doctrine and practice of the universal church , for our holy observation of this day ; it ill beseems any Christian to forsake all or any of these , and think now in the end of the world to find out the certain practice of the apostles , better than all the churches which they planted . 

53.  Seeing the Lord's day is purposely set apart for the celebrating of the memorial of the resurrection of Christ , and so of the work of our redemption ( As the Sabbath was for the commemorating of the work of creation ) , the work of the day must be very much eucharistical , and the church should be taken up in the thankful admiration of the mystery and mercy of our redemption , and in the affectionate praises of the Lord our redeemer , and an aspiring after the everlasting rest , which he hath purchased , and promised , and prepared for us with himself . 

54.  Ministers must not only perform the public worship of God upon this day , but also exhort the persons to improve the rest of it in private , by prayer , and meditation , and holy conference , and calling to mind the word which they have heard ; especially the parents and Masters of families , who must instruct their children and servants , and watch over them , and restrain them from the violation of the day , and call them to an account of the doctrine they have heard , and the duties to be performed . 

55.  It is lawful , and a duty on other days also , according to our necessities and opportunities , to redeem some time for the public worship of God . And whenever the pastors shall call the church together , to hear the word , or perform holy worship , it is the people's duty obediently and gladly to attend , if greater duties do not prohibit them . 

56.  When great afflictions lie upon the church , or any useful members of it ; or when any great sins have been committed among them , it is meet that in public by fasting and prayer we humble ourselves before the Lord , for the averting of his displeasure . And on such occasions it is the pastor's duty to confess his own and the people's sins , with penitence and tenderness of heart , and by his doctrine and exhortation to endeavour effectually to bring the persons to the sight and sense of their sin , and the deserts of it , and to a firm resolution of better obedience for the time to come ; being importunate with God in prayer for pardon and renewed grace . 

57  Upon the receipt of any notable extraordinary mercies , the church having opportunity , should assemble for public thanksgiving unto God : wherein the pastors should stir them up to the livelyest sense of the greatness of their mercies , and lead them in a joyful celebration of the praises of their bountiful benefactor . And it is lawful on these days to express our joy in feasting and outward signs of mirth ; provided that they be moderately and spiritually used , and not to gratify our sensual desires ; and that we relieve the poor in their necessities ( Which also on days of humiliation and other seasons we must not forget . ) 

58.  It is not unlawful or unmeet to keep an anniversary commemoration of some great and notable mercies to the church , the memory whereof should be transmitted to posterity . 

59  In all the modes and circumstances of worship which God himself hath left undetermined , all Christians must take heed of making unnecessary things to be necessary , and laying the unity and peace of the church on things indifferent , and laying snares for the consciences of others ; but must leave much to the prudence of the particular pastors that are upon the place , to whom it belongs to fit such circumstantials to their people's state ; and the churches in such things wherein they May safely differ , must be left to their liberty : long and sad experience having taught us , that the violent imposing of unnecessary things , is the engine of the devil to tear the church . 

60.  The marriage of Christians being a work of great concernment to themselves , and meet to be publicly performed , and accordingly to be sanctified by the word and prayer ; it is convenient that it be solemnised by the minister , or at least that he counsel and exhort them , and pray for a blessing on them : being first sufficiently satisfied of their capacity and necessary preparations . Herein he is to acquaint them with the institution , nature and ends of their relations ; and the duties severally and jointly by them to be performed ; and the difficulties and temptations to be expected and provided for . Especially they are to be directed to live together in holiness , as the heirs of life , and to be very careful and diligent in the holy education of their children , and governing their families for the Lord ; and to use the world as not abusing it , remembering their approaching separation by death . And he is to see that they solemnly enter into the matrimonial covenant , engaging themselves to conjugal fidelity to each other , until they are separated by death . 

61.  The pastors of the churches must not only teach the persons , and guide them in the public worship : but also must faithfully oversee them in private , endeavouring to know and watch over each member of their flock , preserving them from heresies , errors , and divisions : defending the truth , confuting gainsayers and seducers ; instructing the ignorant , exciting the negligent ; encouraging the despondent ; comforting the afflicted , confirming the weak , rebuking and admonishing the disorderly and scandalous , and directing all according to their needs , in the matters of their salvation . And the persons in such needs should have ordinary recourse to them , as the officers of Christ , for guidance and resolution of their doubts , and for assistance in making their salvation sure , and procuring , maintaining or restoring the peace of their consciences , and spiritual consolation . 

62.  Those persons that are known to commit any gross and scandalous sin , should first by private reproof and admonition ( Unless where the notoriousness and heinousness of the crime doth presently call for public reproof ) be called to repentance : and if they hear not the reprovers , or will not reform , the church must be told of it : and therein it is most convenient , that the pastors be first acquainted with the case ( To avoid contention and confusion , ) before it be brought into the public assembly : and to that end it is convenient that there be stated meetings where the pastors and some chosen members of the church , ( Not as officers , but the deputies or trustees of the rest ) should in their several capacities take cognizance of such offences ; that so a unity and full correspondence May be held between the pastors and the flock , and all things May be done advisedly , orderly , and concordantly : but where this cannot well be done , the pastor or pastors must do their work without it . 

63.  Those persons that by more private means will not be brought to necessary repentance and reformation , must by the pastor be publicly reproved and admonished before the church , and there called to repentance by the opening of their sin , and the judgements of the Lord , and pleading with them those gospel mercies and motives that should melt them into contrition . And if the success do not appear , it is ordinarily meet that the church should join in prayer for the offender , that God would give him repentance unto life . 

64.  If after sufficient waiting in the use of these means , the offendor still remain impenitent , it is the duty of the church to reject him out of their communion . Wherein the pastors must compassionately declare his offence and his impenitency , and the judgements that God hath threatened to such , and the laws of Christ commanding the church to put such from among them , and avoid them , and have no company with them , that they May be ashamed , or to take them as heathen men or publicans : and must accordingly declare the person offending to be unmeet for Christian communion , and charge the persons to avoid him , and have no fellowship with him , and himself to forbear the communion of Christians , binding him over to answer it at the bar of Christ . Which sentence must be accordingly executed by the pastors , in refusing him the ordinances proper to the church , and by the persons in avoiding familiarity and communion with him , till he be restored upon his repentance . 

65.  It must be a credible profession of repentance only that must be accepted by the church either for the preventing of such a rejection , or for restoring the rejected . And usually when the case is heinous and notorious , or the church hath had the public cognizance of it , they must also have public notice of the penitence of the offendor ; who should with remorse of conscience and true contrition confess his sin before the congregation , and heartily lament it , and crave the prayers of the church to God for pardon and reconciliation through Christ , and also crave an absolution by the minister , and a restoration into the communion of the church : but because it much dependeth on circumstances of the case whether the confession should be public or private , or in what manner made , it is therefore to be much left to the prudence of the pastors , whom the persons in such cases are commanded to obey . 

66.  When a credible profession of repentance is made ( Whether voluntarily by the converted , or upon the church's admonition by the scandalous , or after excommunication ) it is the duty of the pastors to declare such penitents in the name of Christ to be pardoned and absolved , and ministerially to give them this mercy from the Lord , in case their repentance be sincere as they profess : and if the person were excommunicate , it is the duty of the pastor to declare him again meet for the communion of the church , and require the church to receive him with joy as a returning sinner , and not to reproach him with his falls , but to forgive him ; as Christ forgiveth him ; all which they are accordingly to perform ; and the penitent with joy to receive his absolution , and to return to the communion of the church , and to a more holy careful obedient life . 

67.  When any by frequent covenant-breaking , have forfeited the credit of their words , the church must have testimony of the actual reformation of such persons , before they can receive their professions and promises as credible any more . Though yet there is so great difference here in persons and offences , that the particular cases must be much left to the prudence of the pastors that are present , and know the persons and the whole case . 

68  So great is the necessity of the sick , and so seasonable and advantageous the opportunity , that ministers should not negligently omit them , but in love and tenderness instruct them , according to their several conditions : endeavouring the conversion of the ungodly , and the strengthening of the weak , and comforting such as need consolation ; directing them how to improve their affliction ; and helping them to be truly sensible of the evil of sin , the miscarriages and negligences of their lives ; the vanity of the world ; the necessity and sufficiency of Christ , and the certainty and excellency of the everlasting glory : persuading them to a pious , just and charitable disposal of their worldly estate ; and to forgive such as have wronged them , and to be reconciled to those with whom they have been at variance ; and believingly to hope for that life with Christ , which he hath promised to all that are sanctified by his spirit , and comfortably to commit their souls to their redeemer , and quietly rest in the will , and love , and promises of God ; resolving if God should recover them to health , to redeem their time , and live as a persons devoted to his glory . It is meet also that the pastors pray for the sick , both privately and publicly when it is desired and thought fit . 

69.  The burial of Christians should be decent and honourable , and though it be a thing indifferent in itself , whether exhortations , funeral sermons or prayers be then used , yet because the season is very advantageous for men's reception of holy instructions , it is convenient ( At least when desired ) that the minister do take that season as often as he can , to mind persons of their mortality , and the necessity of a speedy preparation for their change : so prudently managing all his exhortations and prayers , that the due end May be attained , and the abuse prevented as far as May be . 

70.  The lives of Christ's ministers should be conformable to their holy doctrine : and so exemplary in innocency , love , humility , meekness , patience , contempt of the world , crucifying the desires of the flesh , and in a zealous heavenly conversation , and in all works of piety , justice and charity , within their power , that the mouths of the enemies May be stopped , and the persons May learn , and be convinced and directed , even by their holy examples , and ourselves May be saved , and the Christian church and doctrine May be honoured , to the glory of the holy ghost and of our redeemer , and our heavenly father . 

71.  As we have all one God , one Christ , one spirit , one faith , and hope , and love , one covenant , and one Catholic church , so should the communion of saints extend as far as their capacity and opportunities will allow . And as particular persons must associate for personal communion in public worship , so particular churches should associate for such brotherly correspondency and communion , as they are capable of , and their needs require ; that by communicating the truths and mercies which they have received , and advising together , and by a brotherly collation of their apprehensions , and improvement of their several gifts , the unity of the churches May be preserved , and discords and uncharitableness May be avoided , and the beauty and strength of the churches maintained . And therefore the pastors of the neighbour churches ( Not excluding others that are fit ) should meet as frequently , and at such times and places , as the ends and works of the association do require . 

72.  Into these associations such pastors and churches should be received that make a credible profession of faith and holiness , and no other : and they that are heretics , or of scandalous ungodly lives , must after a first and second admonition , if they remain impenitent , be rejected and disowned by the faithful pastors and churches . 

73.  Where the fixing of a stated precedent in each of these associations is requisite for the peace and edification of the brethren , it May well be yielded to : but however a special care must be had to prevent contentions and divisions : and therefore perverse disputings must be suppressed ; and proud , self-conceited , domineering persons , and such as are of fiery , turbulent , contentious spirits , and also subtle heretics and dividers , must be watched against as the plague of the churches , and all possible charity , humility , meekness , self-denial , and zeal for holy concord , must be exercised . 

74.  Those that through distance or impediments cannot , or through mistakes or peevishness will not join in such stated brotherly associations and assemblies , are yet to be allowed the due estimation and affection of brethren , and so much communion as at a distance they are capable of , if they do but agree with us in a sound profession of the faith , and a holy conversation , and ministerial fidelity in the main : but yet we must disown the sin of their dividing , or neglect , and as we have opportunity testify against it . 

75.  These churches that cannot hold local communion with one another through differences that destroy not the essentials of Christianity , should yet maintain a dear and tender Christian love to one another , and profess their owning each other as Christians , and churches of Jesus Christ , and should agree together upon certain just and equal rules for the management of their unavoidable differences , so as May least prejudice charity and common good , and least harden the ungodly , or grieve the weak , or dishonour God , or hinder the success of common , great and necessary truths upon the souls of men ; contriving and amicably promoting the cause of Christianity , and every part of it , in which they are agreed ; and should open their disagreements to the persons as little as they can . 

76.  In cases of tolerable difference , as ministers and persons must maintain a special holy love , and communion as far as their differences will admit ; so must they desire the welfare and the peace of one another , and not stir up hatred or persecution , against each other , by odious nicknames , or exasperating the magistrate or persons against dissenters ; but should consent to the liberty of each other , and help to take off unjust hatred , and to hinder all unmerciful violence or rigor against one another ; and all of us should watch against and abhor that proud , self-conceited , domineering disposition that would make us censorious , malicious , or cruel against the weakest servants of the Lord . 

77.  Yet must we not under pretence of charity , consent to any such noxious liberty , as plainly tendeth to the wrong of the church , and the poisoning of the souls of others ; nor yet must we consent to the errors of the best . Though we are not the judges of the secrets of men's hearts , nor May not deal uncharitably with any , yet must not heretical self-conceited persons be tolerated in the obstinate dispersing of their errors , to the destruction or danger of men's souls , nor to reproach and speak against the weighty necessary truths of God : nor should any be tolerated to kindle the flames of uncharitableness and contentions in the churches , by railing , reproachful language against the tolerable dissenters : but a healing , merciful , and profitable , and not a destructive toleration should be promoted . 

78.  The pastors of the churches of Christ have the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven , but not of the temporal sword on earth : and though we determine not whether in cases of necessity , it be lawful for pastors to be also magistrates ; yet it is certain that without necessity it should not be allowed ( Their work requiring all their time and strength ) and that as pastors it belongeth not to them ; but as the magistrate is the appointed officer of God , to govern even churches , pastors , and persons , in the way of outward force , and pastors are his officers to govern them by spiritual conduct ; so must we be so far from desiring to usurp a secular power , that we should still advise the magistrate to keep the sword in his own hand , and to take heed of putting compulsive power in the hands of pastors , or enabling them to execute their passionate displeasure against their brethren : and as the magistrate must not usurp the pastor's office , but only see that we perform it ourselves , and punish us if we do not ; so must not the pastors usurp the magistrates office , but humbly and modestly teach and advise him from the word of God , and reprove him , and threaten him , and in cases of extremity denounce the wrath of God against him , and bind him over to the tribunal of heaven , to answer for his obstinate impenitent contempt ; and than leave all the matter to that bar , and patiently suffer if we be persecuted by him ; not doing any thing in the management of any of our work , without a due respect and reverence to his authority , and a care of the common good that dependeth on his honour , but remembering what is meet for him to hear , and for us as messengers of Christ to speak . 

79.  Those churches of several nations that through distance and diversity of secular governors , are uncapable of personal or local communion with others , should yet consent as near as May be in their holy professions , and practices ; not tying each other to any of their unnecessary modes or forms , nor uncharitably censuring any tolerable dissenters , but owning those churches that agree with them in the great and necessary things , & holding such correspondence with them by messengers , as shall be needful to the promoting of their unity , love and peace , and of the gospel and common cause of Christ , and the defence of each other against the common enemies of those , as emergent occasions shall require and direct them . 

80.  To the aforesaid uses , the councils or synods of pastors are lawful and convenient in cases that require them , where the pastors of several churches and nations May diliberate and determine in order to their unity , of doctrines and practices to be agrreed in , and May strengthen the hands of one another . But yet , the canons of such councils are rather agreements , then proper laws , to their several members or absent brethren ; and bind in order to unity and concord by virtue of those general commands that require us to do the work of God in such unity and concord , and not by virtue of any proper superior Regimental power , which that council hath over the particular Bishops of the churches of Christ . And as for general councils , as we should to the forementioned ends regard and honour them above all other , if really such were lawfully assembled ; so in this enlarged and dispersed state of the militant church , we May easily see , that full and proper universal councils , are neither the stated governors of the universal church , nor necessary to its well-being , no nor lawful to be attempted , as a course that would certainly destroy or grievously wrong the churches , by the death and long absence of the pastors , through so many hundred and thousand miles' travail , and so long attending , which the state and work of proper universal councils will require : yea the said distance , with the age and weakness of the pastors , and the different languages , and the poverty of many disabling them from such tedious voyages and journeys , and the dissent of the Princes . ( Many of them heathens , infidels , Mahometans ) under whose government they live , or through whose dominions they must pass , these with many the like impediments do make a true universal council ( Like an universal parliament or senate ) to be so far . from necessary , or desirable , as to be morally impossible , or next to impossible , as to the very being of it . 

The way that God hath appointed for church-government and deciding controversies , is , 1.  That Princes and magistrates govern by the sword or force , and judge who are fit to be punished by the sword ( And though most Princes on the earth by infidelity have made themselves uncapable of this part of the work of their office , yet cannot that disoblige them from the commands of God , or free them from his punishments for not performing them , nor make the office of magistrates another thing , nor disable Christian Princes and magistrates , or disoblige them who have not made themselves uncapable . ) 2.  That these Princes and governors of several nations , do hold a loving Christian correspondency , for the management of their affairs , and government of the churches under them , so as May be most to the advantage of the cause of Christ , and the union , strength and defence of Christians ; ( The general rules , and ends of their trust and power , do oblige them to hold such assemblies by their messengers as are needful for their agreement and the unity and safety of the churches under them , as well as they oblige pastors to such necessary correspondencies . ) 3.  That the pastors of particular churches be the governors of those churches by the word and holy discipline ( Not having the power of the sword or violence ) and that they judge who is fit or unfit for communion with that church which each or any of them oversee , and who is to be thence excommunicated , or there absolved . 4.  That these Bishops , pastors , or elders of particular churches , should hold communion among themselves with all their brethren of other churches , as far as their natural capacity will allow , and the need or benefit of the churches require it : and that they handle in common the causes that belong to all in common , and settle and maintain agreements for the unity and communion of the churches : and they are judges ( As associate ) who is to be received into their associate communion ; and who to be excluded from it ; and what pastors or churches they should hold such communion with as they are capable of ; and which they should admonish , or renounce . 5.  The Christian persons have allowed them a judgement of discretion , by which they must prove all things , and hold fast that which is good : and must discern and obey the lawful commands and directions of their magistrates and pastors . 6.  And as men have thus their several shares allotted them in government , judgement , and decisions , limitedly , and not absolutely judging , even to the execution which belongs to their several judicatures : so the final absolute judgement , and decision of all controversies and causes , is reserved to the dreadful tribunal of the Lord , to which we May make our last appeal , where all the world shall be judged in righteousness , and all the judgements of men be themselves judged , and truth and error , good and evil , right and wrong will be more perfectly manifested unto all ; and it shall be irreversibly determined by Jesus Christ , who shall go into life everlasting , and who to everlasting punishment . 

Come Lord Jesus , come quickly . novemb. 16. 1658.  The author thought it not unfit here to annex the description of that order and discipline which is exercised by him , with his assistant fellow-pastors , in the parish-church of Kederminster ; in association with many pastors of those parts , who have agreed to exercise so much of the ministerial office , as by the consent of the episcopal , Presbyterian , and congregational , belongeth to them . Which being published , 1.  May prevent men's injurious misreports of our associations , and discipline , which they May be drawn to by fallacious fame . 2.  And May be an example for those churches that by the magistrates are left at liberty , to worship God in that communion and order which they judge most agreeable to the word of God , and the universal consent and practice of the primitive church . 

The order and discipline of this church , agreeable to the word of God . I. we are willing to teach all in our parish , the doctrine of life , that are willing to learn : and desire them all to hear the word publicly preached , and to come to us to be catechised or instructed . 

Ii we own all those as visible Christians and members of the universal church , that make a credible profession of Christianity , and destroy it not by heresy , or ungodly lives . 

Iii so many of these as also consent to hold communion with this church as members of it , submitting to the ministers and discipline of Christ , we shall esteem our flock and special charge , and faithfully perform the duties of our office for their good , as we are able . 

Iv. we desire that all the youth of the parish will learn the principles of the Christian religion : and as soon as they understand it , and are heartily resolved to give up themselves to God in Christ through the spirit , and to lead a holy life , that they will come and acquaint us with their faith and resolution ; and before the church will make a solemn profession thereof , and give up themselves to God in the personal owning their baptismal covenant ; either reciting the foregoing creed or profession , or , if they are unfit for public speaking , by consenting when we propound it to them ; or by any other fit expressions . That so we May publicly pray for their confirmation ; and if they consent also to hold communion with this church , we May know them as our charge , and register their names . 

V. those parishioners that desire us to baptise their children , or to be themselves admitted to the Lord's supper , and are not members of this church , ( Because they will not ) , we desire to come to us , some days before ; that so we May be satisfied of their faith and life : and if they seem true Christians , and either bring a certificate that they are members of any other church , with ( Which we are to hold communion , or show that it is not from ungodliness that they refuse to live under order and discipline , we shall baptise their children , and occasionally admit them to our communion . But if they are scandalous , we shall require them first to profess their serious repentance : and if they return to scandal , we shall after stay till we see their reformation ( Or of one of the parents in case of baptism . ) 

Vi . If any member of this church do differ from us about the gesture in the Lord's supper ( Or any such circumstance ) we desire them first to come to us , and hear our reasons : and if we cannot satisfy them , we will not hinder them from receiving it in any decent gesture they desire . 

Vii . All members of the church must ordinarily hold communion with it , in the Lord's supper and all ordinances : and if a brother grossly offend , they must orderly and prudently admonish him ; and if he hear them not , tell the church . 

Viii . Once a month we have a meeting of the magistrates , ministers , deacons , and above twenty persons chosen annually by the church , as their trustees or deputies : here the offenders must be accused , and heard , and dealt with , before the case be opened in the church . And any that are justly offended with any member , May have church-justice . ( The magistrates presence being only ad melius esse ) and the chosen trustees or deputies being no ecclesiastical officers , nor pretending to divine institution as such : but only the fittest of the persons chosen to do those things which belong to the persons ( Who cannot all so frequently meet ) and having no authoritative ruling votes . 

Ix. . Those that repent not upon public admonition , must be cast out of our communion , and avoided as heathens : but those that are penitent , must be absolved , and lovingly received . 

X. if any of our persons be offended at any thing in our doctrine or life , we desire them before they vent their offence behind our backs , to come and lovingly tell it us , and hear us speak . And if we do not satisfy them , we desire them to open the matter before the ministers of this association , who are here assembled every month . And we shall before them , be responsible , for our doctrine , our administrations , and our lives . ( As we are also willing to be to the magistrate , who only hath the power of the sword , even over the pastors of the church , and whom in all things lawful we must obey , and not resist . )
