# Experiments in data science and machine learning

This repository includes: 1) a set of scripts, 2) a library of plain text files, 3) a few "study carrels", and 4) a few supporting files. The purpose of the repository is to experiment with data science and machine learning. More specifically, the purpose of the repository is to explore different ways corpora can be "read". --Eric Lease Morgan (January 1, 2019)
