LONDON : Printed by J.C. for Francis Titan at the three Daggers in Fleetstreet . 1672.  

To the Worshipful , and my very much honoured , Robert Corbet of Stanwardine in the Wood , in the County of Salop Esq and to his Religious Consort , M rs . Elizabeth Corbet ; together with the rest of the Congregation in the Parish of Baschurch , over which the Holy Ghost hath made me Overseer . My very much honoured in the Lord , 

THE reason of this inscription is not because you are preferred by God , by your birth , family , estate , and other outward privileges , to be the chief of the Inhabitants of my Parish : for although I acknowledge the Wisdom and Will of God , as the cause of this order and distinction among men ; and therefore do heartily give you the honour which belongs to you upon this account ; yet I must confess , that this is not the cause of this public acknowledgement : But the reason is , that whereas many great persons are a great curse to their Country , which they fill with their own sins , and Gods Judgements ; God hath made you the blessing of your Age , in endeavouring to fill your place with the Name , and Kingdom , and Will of Jesus Christ ; and that in the great changes of our days , you have not , as many , served the times , and your sins , but served the Lord , and your Generation : And also because of your great honour , and love to the godly , able , and Orthodox Ministers of Christ , and to his holy , humble , sober , and peaceable people , which have been loathsome to others , as the sink of the world ; but savoury to you , as the salt of the earth : for which although you have joyfully suffered reproach from some ; yet you have had the honour , like that gracious couple , Andronicus and Junia , to be of note among the Apostles : And particularly , that you were of the first that called me to exercise my Ministry in this place , wherein I have by your constant favour and countenance received much comfort and encouragemet : The sense of all which , together with my great joy in you , by my hopes of your being of the blessed number of those who are really joined to Jesus Christ , and clothed with his righteousness , and who bring forth fruit in him , ( which alone can make of you a sweet savour to God , and for that reason precious , and acceptable to his Saints ) hath caused me to signify my sincere honour , and love , and thankfulness to you , by this Dedication . Now although I hope I write this in the singleness of my heart , as believing that God will cut off all flattering lips , and that a lying tongue is but for a moment ; yet I confess it fills me with serious thoughts , to consider that this when I am dead , will be yet speaking : And that hereby I speak to you , as it were , in the hearing of the world ; and that some whom we are bound in Christian wisdom and charity to judge as upright Saints , yet the heart-searching God may justly judge as Hypocrites ; and that many who have made a greater profession of godliness than any of us , have proved fearful Apostates , when they have been tried by Errors , Persecutions , or Preferments : I shall therefore , looking upon myself and you as just in our very fall into Eternity , and as presently going to Judgement , and with the greatest belief and thoughts that I can get of Heaven and Hell upon my heart , seriously beseech you ( according to the intent of this ensuing Treatise ) to examine yourselves whether ( if you were to die in the reading of this ) you have a true Scripture-right to go to heaven ; that so you may find the Witness of God by the word in your own consciences , agreeing with this public testimony of your poor Minister : for it is but a poor thing for a man of so little credit , and lesle worth , to confess you before men ; but this will be an honour indeed , to have Jesus Christ to confess you before his Father in Heaven , on the great day of the manifestation of the Sons of God. And continue to live as discerning the great difference betwixt a godly and ungodly man , that you may still be known by this character , to be persons in whose eyes a vile person ( though never so great in the world ) is contemned ; but to honour them ( though never so poor ) that fear the Lord This difference must needs be great , when I dare be bold to say , that it is beyond the tongues of men and Angels fully to express the excellency and glory of the one , and the vileness and misery of the other : And certainly the further insight you have in the Scriptures , in God and Christ , Men and Devils , Sin and Grace , Heaven and Hell , the more clearly you will know this difference . Do but look on the Godly , and Wicked , as they appear in sickness and death , and in the Day of Judgement ; these put an eternal period to all other distinctions : there will be then no such difference as Prince and Subject , Landlord and Tenant , Rich and Poor , but only Godly and Ungodly ; see the difference now , as it will appear , when , Come ye blessed , and Go ye cursed : and the right hand and left hand of Christ hath distinguished and parted the world . 

Be resolved to cleave to Christ , his truth and people , through all the sufferings and stumbling-blocks which you meet with in your way to heaven : sufferings will be harder to you , then to many others : the greater your names and estates are , the greater must your graces be to enable you to part with them ; you have a greater self to deny , and a greater cross to take up : great riches , and great preferments , make many great Persecutors , and great Apostates , but few great Martyrs : you must buy the truth , whatever it cost you : and the more you give for it , the more you will gain by it : if you sell all for Christ , you shall never complain of a dear purchase . Look with the dearest affections upon your Posterity , and believe that you will never have such an opportunity to make them happy , and to entail the blessings of God upon them , as when you are called to suffer for the sake of Christ : you may be called to make a great exchange ; either to part with your lives and estates , and to keep Christ , and heaven ; or to part with Christ , heaven , and your souls , to keep the world : if ever such a day come , look to the poor soul ; above all keeping , keep your poor souls : remembering that of our Saviour , What shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? Be pleased to accept this poor thing , which I humbly offer to you : give it a little room in your Study and Closet , and let the truths therein have a great place in your hearts . Now blessed of the Lord be you , and your hopeful posterity , for the precious things of the earth , and the fullness thereof , and especially for the good will of him that dwelled in the bush . 

Now for the rest of you , my dearly beloved , my joy , and my longed for . 

It is now thirteen years since upon your free choice and consent , I was settled to be your Minister ; I mourn that I have done you no better service ; yet I bless God , that I have done you no worse : Some of you are the people of my joy , others are the people of my hopes , but ( God knows ) you are all the people of my love : possibly you may not enjoy my Ministry long ; though if any thing but death part us , it is like for your sakes to be one of the saddest days of my age . Some know I might have had better places both before , and since I knew you ; but I never thought myself too good for you : the Lord make me better whilst I stay , and give you a better when I am gone . You will wonder to see me appear to you thus public ; my late visitation , whereby I was brought down to the gates of the grave , and brought up again , was the occasion of my preaching these Sermons ; and the unanimous advice of four godly , reverend , and learned Ministers , all known to you , caused their printing , without which my own private thoughts of them had never consented to have them licenced for the Press . I have devoted this little plain Treatise to the Will of God , knowing that if he put power and savour in it , it will prospero : I expect to be scorned by some ; but if God say , Well done , I care not who finds fault ; I had rather bear the reproaches of thousands , than that one poor ‚óèoul should lose the least spiritual and saving good , which I may be a means to help him unto . I leave it with you as a testimony of my sincere love to you , not so much that you may remember me , but that you may remember yourselves , your sins , and your souls ; and that you may remember God , Christ , Heaven , Hell , Death and Judgement , which are always present before you . brethren , I must needs witness that most of you have been constant hearers of the Word , and that you have many hundred Sermons to answer for ; but you must be doers , as well as hearers of the word : the sins of men , and the terrors of the Lord , make me afraid that there is a storm rising , and I doubt there will be a great fall of many professors ; and if you will believe our Saviour , you shall find that those only are built on a rock , and shall certainly stand , who are both the hearers and doers of the word ; I refer you to his own words , Matth. 7.24 , 25 , 26 , 27.  

I beseech you let not the world and sin come between your hearts and Christ ; let nothing keep you from heaven , which cannot keep you from hell . Now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting Covenant , make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen . 

Your servant for Jesus sake , Edward Laurence . 

Baschurch , July 11. 1661.  Reader , 

Though nothing be more certain and common than Death , it is no common thing to be prepared for it ; or else salvation would be common : As there are no Truths that are more necessary to be oft preached and heard , than those which almost all men know ; so also no duties are more necessary to be urged , than those that almost all confess , and think they practice : who will not acknowledge that preparation for death should be the daily business of our lives , and done with the first and most serious of our cares ! And yet , to the shame of corrupted human nature , we must speak it , thousands that are uncertain to live an hour , and certain to be lost for ever , if death surprise them in the state which they are in , are as mindless of a serious preparation , and of the change which should go before that change , as if it were no part of their concernment : Methinks it is a very doleful spectacle to see men unprepared to die , as busily taken up with impertinent diversions , as if their work were done already : One drinking , and prating , and singing in an Alehouse or Tavern , though unprepared to die : another employed in feasting , and compliment , and such company and discourse as will least trouble him with such thoughts , while yet he is unprepared to die : another scraping for deceitful riches , or gaping and scrambling for preferment , while yet he is unprepared to die : another quieting his carnal heart with mere hypocritical outsides and lip-service , as if he could charm an unprepared soul into Heaven , by saying or hearing a few words : and few will know feelingly what an important work Preparation is , till the terrors of approaching death be upon them . 

One of God's means for men's preparation , is , to give his Ministers a special fitness to assist them in the work . As Christ took part with the children that were partakers of flesh and blood , Heb. 2.14 . and in all things must be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful Highpriest , and in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted , v. 17 , 18. so that we have not an Highpriest that cannot be touched with the feeling our of infirmities , Heb. 4.15 . Even so his Ministers must be mortals , frail , and subject to like passions as other men , James 5.17 . and the treasure of the spirit must be in earthen vessels , 2 Cor. 4 7.  They must be sick , that they may the better teach you to prepare for sickness ; and they must be exercised in preparing for death themselves , that they may be the fitter to teach you to prepare . The God of Comfort comforteth them in all their tribulations , that they may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the Comfort wherewith they are comforted of God ‚Äî ‚óènd whether they be afflicted or comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation . Even when they are pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch as they despair of life , they receive the sentence of death in themselves , that they may not trust in themselves , but in God that raised the dead ‚Äî that thanks may be given by many on their behalf , 2 Cor. 1.3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 11.  Whereas those that are insensible of their nearness to eternity , and in healthful prosperity grow secure , are like to be no lively feeling Preachers , nor fit to waken others to that serious preparation , which they are wilful strangers to themselves : but rather like to be corrupted with ambition , worldliness , idleness , flesh‚óèpleasing , man-pleasing ‚ñ™ superficialness , formality , and trifling in Religion , and vexing the Church with their contentions about their Ceremonies and Opinions , till the approach of death do help them to juster apprehensions , and bring them to such confessions as Bishop Ridley made to Hooper in his imprisonment . thou hast here in this Treatise the wholesome savoury fruit of sickness : This servant of the Lord was cast down and delivered , to teach him how to teach thee to prepare . The subject is of such universal usefulness , and yet fully handled by so few , so needful to be much studied in health , and the Book so fit for the reading of the sick , or for those friends to read to them that are about them , or visit them , that ( though urgent business prohibited me to read it all ; yet having perused the most of it , and observed the scope and spirit of the work , ) I think it my duty to recommend it to thy thankful acceptance and improvement ; assuring thee , ( upon long experience of the benefits of a dying life ) that the time is at hand , when the studies of death , and thy everlasting state , will appear to have been more necessary and wise , than all those impertinences that now divert distracted worldlings , and are but the seed of endless sorrows . 

Thy Brother in the Patience and Hope of Believers , Richard Baxter . 

August 1. 1661.  Matth. 8.5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13.  5.  And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a Centurion , beseeching him , 

6.  And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the Palsy , grievously tormented . 

7.  And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him . 

8.  The Centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy thou shouldst come under my roof ; but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed . 

9  For I am a man under Authority , having Soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doth it . 

10.  When Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great Faith , no not in Israel . 

11.  And I say unto you , that many shall come from the East and West , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven . 

12.  But the children of the Kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . 

13.  And Jesus said unto the Centurion , Go thy way , and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour . 

THE mighty Hand of God , which hath of late come upon me , whereby ( I must bear him witness that ) he hath in his Fatherly Wisdom , and Goodness , and Faithfulness visited me , hath caused me to wink a little at the pomp and bravery of this world , and to set before my eyes the ghastly sight of those many Beds of Sickness , wherein the poor children of men lie languishing : I have seriously thought what a poor Creature Man is , when he lies gasping under the power and torture of a disease ; and withal have considered how little a Consumption , or a Fever , or the Small Pocks , or any other disease , cares for the strength , or wealth , or youth , or beauty of a man I have seen the great changes which these make in Nations , and Cities , and Families , and persons where they are sent . I have endeavoured to stand at the Door of Eternity , looking on these Messengers , carrying multitudes before me out of this into the other world . The Grave , that House of Darkness tells me , These bring my ghastly Inhabitants to lodge in me ; the Worms say , These bring our brethren and Sisters unto us ; Hell from beneath cries , These have turned multitudes of damned Souls into me ; and Heaven from above cries , These have brought many blessed Spirits into me . 

Upon these , and other considerations , I have desired for my own , and others good , to see clearly out of whose hands all sicknesses and diseases come , that I may acknowledge myself , and assert and testify unto others , the absolute Command and Dominion which God and Jesus Christ have over all these things ; the true knowledge and improvement whereof , may have a powerful influence upon us in our health , to make us daily look and prepare for sickness ; and in our sickness to make us fit to live , or fit to die : and when we are restored to health , to teach us to whose Will and Glory we should live ; and to make us ready for sickness and death , when they return ; and by all , to cause us to hasten into that blessed state , and to live in that gracious frame , that both in life and health , sickness and death , we may have always a plain passage , and a clear and safe entrance into that everlasting Kingdom of Glory , which is always set open before us . For these ends I have chosen this Text , which is full of this Argument , viz. to prove that all sicknesses and diseases , are under the Command of Jesus Christ . This Scripture is recorded by two Evangelists ; by Matthew in the place beforementioned , and by Luke , Cap. 7. from ver . 1. to ver . 11. they differ chiefly in two things . 

1.  Luke makes a more prolix and large relation than Matthew ; and therefore we read some things there , not mentioned here . 

2.  Matthew speaks as if the Centurion came , and spoke to Christ in Person , v. 5 , 6. but Luke tells us expressly , that he sent unto him the Elders of the Jews , v. 3. and after sent other friends to meet him , v. 6.  This difference hath made some conceive , that they are distinct Relations of two distinct Miracles ; but without ground : for it is ordinary to speak of that which a man doth by others , as if he did it by himself ; as the words which John the Baptist spoke by his Disciples , are mentioned as if he had spoken them himself , Matth. 11.2 , 3.  

So the Evangelist here reports , that the Centurion came to Christ , beseeching him ; meaning , not that he came in person , but that he came and spoke by his messengers , as St. Luke explains it : and thus the two Evangelists are reconciled . Now why the Centurion came not to Christ in person ; whether it was , because he thought he had no right to come for such a mercy , being a gentile ; or whether the sense of his unworthiness made him afraid or ashamed to come ; or what other reason there was , because it cannot certainly be known , therefore it is not wisdom too curiously to inquire . 

The Text is a Narration of Christ's miraculous healing the Centurion's servant of a deadly disease , upon the faith and prayer of his good Master . There are three main things which make up the subject of this Narration . 

1.  The Servants mortal disease . 

2.  The Master's miraculous Faith.  

3.  Christ's Miraculous Cure.  

In the whole , observe these four particulars . 

1.  Here is the Centurion's servant lying diseased , ver . 6.  Lord , my servant lies at home sick of the Palsy , grievously tormented . Luke saith , Cap. 7.2 . He was sick , ready to die . The person thus visited , was a servant : in Matthew , the Centurion is said to call him „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ , which may be translated , my child ; for the word is ambiguous , signifying either a child , or a servant : but in Luke he is called „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ a servant ; yet it is said , a servant who was dear to him : and it seems , by considering both together , that he was a good , faithful , and obedient servant , and therefore as dear to his Master as his child . 

I shall take occasion from hence to call upon servants to do the Will of God in their Relation : Servants , labour in all faithfulness , and diligence , to honour your Masters ; keep up their Authority in your Souls , and let your whole carriage savour of a heart that willingly , cheerfully , and humbly yields up itself in obedient subjection thereunto : 1 Pet. 2.18 . Servants , be subject to your Masters with all fear . 1 Tim. 6.1 . Let servants count their own Masters worthy of all honour . 

1.  Consider the Family where thou livest is Jesus Christ's ; he is the Great Master of every Family ; and he hath given Authority to the Master of the Family where thou dwellest to be his Vicegerent therein , and to bear his Image and Authority , and to rule in his stead : therefore as thou art a Christian , and so to honour Christ by believing in him , and by rejoicing in him , and by doing his Will ; so the honour thou owest to Jesus Christ , as thou art a servant , is to honour , and serve , and obey thy Master in him : The Apostle requires the obedience of servants to their Masters for this very reason , Col. 3.23 , 24.  And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men . ‚Äî For ye serve the Lord Christ . 

Servants , believe that you are threshing for Christ , and ploughing for Christ , and spinning for Christ ; this will make you do your service heartily , when you consider that you are therein serving the Lord Christ ; and this will make you afraid of disobeying , and despising your Masters , when you consider that you do thereby , as much as in you lies , depose the Authority of Jesus Christ from ruling and governing in the Family . 

2.  Consider , that you do hereby adorn the Gospel of Christ : This is the Apostles argument , Tit. 2.10 . That they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things . What Doctrine this is , appears by the following words , the Doctrine of the Grace of God , which bringeth Salvation . O how should this prevail with you , to consider , that when in conscience to God you are faithful , diligent , quiet , and obedient servants , you are a precious Ornament to the Gospel of Jesus Christ ! The Gospel is honoured , not only by Ministers when they preach the Gospel , and by Martyrs when they die for the Gospel ; but also by poor servants , when they live in their service , as those who are ruled by the Gospel : therefore believe the Glory of Jesus Christ , as it is revealed , and appears in the Gospel ; and then own and honour the Face , and Image , and Authority of the same Christ , as it shines in thy Master , whom he hath placed to bear his Authority over thee . 

3.  Consider , that faithful servants are exceeding precious to Jesus Christ : thou thinkest it a sad case , that thou must spend all thy days to toil and drudge like a poor servant ; but consider the Apostle , 1 Cor. 7.21 . Art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : never let that trouble thee , that thou art a servant : And the Apostle gives this reason for thy comfort , vers . 22.  For he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lords freeman . When many a gallant Lord and Lady is a servant to sin , and a slave to the Devil , and stands bound to suffer the wrath of God for ever ; thou that art but a poor godly servant , and art bound to men ; yet thou art set free from Sin , and Satan , and Hell , and hast a sure right to all the privileges of Believers ; though thou art in this mean relation of a servant amongst men , yet thou standest in all the glorious relations to Jesus Christ : a poor servant , and a King and Priest to God : a poor servant , and a Wife and Brother of Jesus Christ : a poor servant , and a glorious Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven . I tell thee , though thou art but a poor servant , yet godliness will put such a grace upon thee , as to make thee a glory to Christ , a crown and joy to thy Minister , a delight to God's people , a terror to the greatest wicked man about thee , and a very torment to the Devil of Hell.  

Lastly , consider , that this is thy particular way , wherein thou art called to please and honour God , and to work out thy own salvation , Psal . 37.23 . The steps of a good man ( be he never so poor ) are ordered by the Lord , and he delighteth in his way . It was an high and holy saying of one , That a poor Milkmaid walking in obedience to God in her calling , doth bring more glory to God then heaven and earth . There is no duty which thou art bound unto , as a man , or as a Christian , which hinders thee in thy duty to God and man , as thou art a servant : for God's commandments do not cross and interrupt one another ; and we cannot sin against God's Will , whilst we are doing his Will ; and true Grace will make thee a gracious servant , as well as a gracious Christian : the same faith and love which cause's thee to believe in , and to cleave unto Jesus Christ , will cause thee to see , and to love , and to obey his will and authority in thy Master : So that when thou art most faithful , and diligent , and obedient in thy service , thou wilt find most freedom and sweetness in Prayer , in Sermons , in singing Psalms , and in feeding upon the Lord's supper . The Apostle requires all servants to be filled with this principle , in their walking obediently to their Masters : Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance , Col. 3.24 . teaching all servants to walk in their Callings so , as those that know , that this is their way to heaven : Ah poor servants , rejoice in your work , for heaven is your wages ; and let me tell you , that you are never like to see a fairer way to heaven , than you have now you are servants : you will find , if ever you come to be husbands , and wives , and parents , and rulers of families , that it is harder to rule then to obey . 

Now there are amongst many other excuses , these three things , which servants pretend , to excuse their irreverence and disobedience to their Masters , which I shall briefly answer , and then proceed . 

First , the servant will pled that his Master is a poor man ; if he were as rich and great a man , as some other Masters are , than I would honour him ; but he is poor , and I am come of as good friends as he . 

Answ . Though thy Master be poor and mean , yet he stands in the place , and bears the authority of the great and glorious God : and if thou seest reason to obey a Master because he is rich , and seest no reason in the authority of God upon him , and in the command of God upon thee to obey a poor Master , it is a sad sign that thou dost honour riches more than God.  

Secondly , but my Master is a wicked man , and then how can I honour him and obey him ? 

Answ . Thy Master indeed cannot bind thee to sin against God : for it can in no case be a man's duty to hate God , and to damn his own soul ; yet when thou disobeyest his sinful commands , let it appear , that this is not to cross thy Master , but to please God : and though he be wicked , yet still honour and obey him in the Lord , and own the image and authority of Christ upon him , which is holy and good . 

Lastly , my Master is so friendly , that he looks for no such reverence : he allows me to be bold , and to be fellowlike with him . 

Answ . This is thy Master's sin , who is bound to keep up that order , which God in wisdom hath appointed ; and he cannot give away the authority of Jesus Christ , nor lose thee from thy duty , whereby God hath bound thee to honour , and reverence , and obey him . 

So much for the first Particular , viz. the Centurion's servant lies diseased . 

Secondly , Here is the care of the good Master over his faithful servant ; the servant lies gasping at the door of death , and the Master lies praying for him at the door of mercy , ver . 5 , 6.  He came beseeching him , saying , etc.  

Here is an example for all Masters , to teach them to be tender , and careful of , and to use all good means for the healing of their sick servants ; as the good Centurion doth here , whose fatherly care and love towards his dear dying servant , appears in four things . 

1.  He keeps him at home . 

2.  He is full of compassion towards him , being sensible of his grief ; therefore ( saith he ) he lies grievously tormented ; his bowels earned towards him , and he useth words to move the bowels of Jesus Christ . 

3.  He useth the best means in the world for his cure ; he seeks help of Jesus Christ , and exerciseth all the might of his Soul , in praying for , and believing a Miracle for the healing of his poor servant . You that are Masters , learn here your duty ; consider you have men and women to your servants , made after the same Image of God with yourselves ; let not then such a workmanship of God perish by your cruelty , covetousness , or negligence . They are Christian servants ; Christ paid as dear for servants , as for Masters ; they are all bought with the same price , 1 Cor. 7.23 . 

Your poor servants have need of further season for repentance , and to work out their salvation ; therefore let not them by your negligence be hastened into eternity : your servant's sickness is an affliction from God upon you ; he lays this burden on your family ; therefore submit to him , and wait upon him in the use of means to remove it ; and ease not thyself by thy sin , to bring a worse burden upon thy conscience . Consider further , your estate is Gods , and you use it for him in a relieving a sick servant ; and I dare say , neither you , nor your children , shall be the poorer , by exercising such charity . To conclude , consider that of the Apostle , Col. 4.1 . Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that ye also have a Master in Heaven . Now this is one thing , which by the Law of God , and the Law of Humanity and Charity , is just and equal , that Masters use all good means in their power , for the health , and ease , and life of a sick servant ; and this you must do , as knowing that you have a Master in Heaven , to whom all the wrong , and injustice , and unmercifulness which you show to your servants , will cry for vengeance against you ; therefore think with thyself , as Job did in the like case , Chap. 31.14 . What then shall I do when God riseth up ? and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ? 

Here is one thing more for all servants to learn ; that is , to choose to live in families where God is worshipped : What a mercy was it to this sick servant , that he had a Master that prayed for him ! Certainly it would much promote Family-worship , if servants would not choose to live in a prayer-less family . I know it 's a dishonour to God , a reproach to Religion , and a wrong to servants , that in many families there is used such unseasonable times for family-worship : I do therefore seriously advice all Masters of Families , into whose hands this shall come , to order your business so , as to make that your ordinary set time to worship God , when you are like to be in the best frame ; and I am persuaded you will find , when once you have wisely set your season for morning and evening worship , and diligently observed it , that in a short time your business will ordinarily fall so , as at those times to leave room for those duties ; however , choose your own time for family-worship , and not your servant's time ; rather when your servants should work , then when they should sleep ; and let all servants make it their choice to dwell in such families , where they are most like to be helped forward in their way to heaven . 

Observe . 3.  Christ's answer to the Centurion's prayer for his sick servant , ver . 7.  And Jesus said , I will come and heal him : He offers his presence to come , and his power and mercy to heal him ; he grants more than the Centurion begs . Observe , God often gives more , but never lesle than believers sincerely ask ; Eph. 3.20 . He is able ( and willing ) to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think : for the power and goodness of God , is infinitely above the highest Faith of the greatest Believer ; we can pray but like men , but he gives like an Infinite God. Now Christ offers to come to his house , as it appears , to set a-work the Centurion's faith : for this passage , I will come , gives occasion for the following words , wherein he pleads two things against Christ's coming to his house . 

1.  His own unworthiness , ver . 8.  I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof . Wherein we may see the gracious modesty of this great Believer : when he hath the highest thoughts of God , he hath the lowest thoughts of himself ; this is Fidei ingenium , as one calls it , the ingenious property of Faith : by it , when a Believer doth most exalt God , he doth most abase himself . 

2.  He pleads , that it was unnecessary for Christ to trouble himself to come to his house , for he could heal him by speaking a word : Speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed . Herein he acknowledgeth the Godhead of Jesus Christ , whose peculiar Prerogative it is to speak creating words , Psal . 33.9 . He spoke , and it was done ; he commanded , and it stood fast : And this truth , that Jesus Christ could by speaking a word , command and create the cure , he proves by an argument taken from the lesle to the greater , ver . 9  For I am a man under Authority , having Soldiers under me , etc.  You may easily see the strength of this argument in this plain Paraphrase ; I am but a man , and thou art the true God ; I am under Authority , but all the power in Heaven , and in Earth , is thine ; I have Soldiers and servants under me , and thou hast all things under thee . Now ( saith he ) if I bid my Soldier go and march to such a place , he goes : and if I command another to come from quartering in such a place , he comes : and if I say to my servant , Do such a business , he doth it . Thus all sicknesses and diseases are under thy command : if thou sayst to a Fever , Go and turn the moisture of such a one into the drought in Summer , it goes ; and to the Consumption , Go and rot the Lungs , and eat up the flesh of such a one , it goes ; and to the Palsy , Go and torment such a one , it goes ; and if thou commandest back a disease , and sayest , Come away , and spare the life of such a one , it presently comes . And again , if thou biddest any disease Do this , make such a Father Childless , such a Wife a Widow , such Children Fatherless , it presently doth it . And thus he wisely and strongly pleads , that all diseases are at the Will of Jesus Christ ; so that a word from him makes them go and come , and do what he william  

Obs . 4.  Christ's carriage after the Centurion's speech , ver . 10.  When Jesus heard it , he marvelled : That must needs be a marvellous Faith , which makes Jesus Christ himself to marvel . 

2.  He highly commends the Centurion's Faith : I have not found so great Faith , no not in Israel . There are three things which speak the greatness of his Faith.  

1.  It was the Faith of a gentile ; and this Christ seems to intend , by comparing it with , and preferring it before the Faith of his Israel ; saying , I have not found so great Faith , no not in Israel . 

2.  Because he did believe a great truth : this is a great truth , worthy of thy strongest faith to be exercised in , that Jesus Christ is that God who commands and rules all the diseases and sicknesses of men . 

3.  Because of the great power and life which appeared in the grace itself : now the might and strength of his faith is seen , both because by it he saw the substance of the truth with so much evidence , and clearness , and certainty , as he did : he did as plainly see , that Christ had the command of diseases , as that he himself had the command of his Soldiers and servants . Beloved , the stronger faith is , the more plain and piercing insight it hath into its object ; and the great power of his faith appeared in believing this truth at such a time , when the infinite power and Eternal Godhead of Christ was so little known and believed in the world . And lastly , by the strong plead of his heart , grounded upon this truth , whereby he draws virtue and power from Christ to heal his dying servant : So that you see great reason why our Saviour commends the greatness of the Centurion's faith . 

3.  Our Saviour from hence takes occasion to teach the Doctrine of the Conversion of the Jews , and Rejection of the Gentiles , ver . 11 , 12. and Christ makes this seasonable digression into this Doctrine , because at this time a poor Gentile excels ever a Jew of his age in believing the power of Jesus Christ . 

Lastly , Christ commands the sick servants cure ; he speaks such a word as the Centurion did pray that he would , and believe that he could speak , ver . 13.  And Jesus said unto the Centurion , Go thy way , and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee : and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour . And thus Christ is honoured for his Miracle , the Centurion is honoured for his Faith , and the poor dying servant hath the comfort of both . 

I shall now pass by all other Observations that may be made out of this Text , and only insist upon this one Doctrine , which I have chosen to be the subject of this discourse , viz.  

Doct That all sicknesses and diseases are at the will , and under the command and government of Jesus Christ , so that he bids them go and come , and do what he will to the children of men . 

This Doctrine is grounded upon the Centurions pleading with Christ , that all diseases were under his command and government , as the Centurion's soldiers were under him ; and also upon this , that Christ testifies the truth of this , in commending the Centurion for the greatness of his faith in believing this truth , and improving it as he did . 

To prevent the misunderstanding of this Doctrine , I shall premise these three Cautions . 

1.  That I do not hereby deny the power and influence that inferior causes may have in bringing diseases upon us ; for I know that many sicknesses come from God through the hands of Angels and Devils ; and that other men , and also ourselves , and that unwholesome diet , the seasons of the years , and diverse other things , may be the instruments and means of diseases unto us ; but yet God is the first and chiefest cause of all diseases ; for it is not in the power of any creature to suspend or withhold that Divine Power and influence which causeth our health ; but this is continued , or denied unto us , according to the will and pleasure of God : and no creature can cause our trouble without God ; for without him a creature can neither be , nor work , but falls to nothing , and so cannot do good or evil . 

2.  I do not exclude the Art of Physicians , nor deny the virtue that is in any medicines for the healing of diseases ; knowing that the same God who had ordained food for our health , hath also ordained physic for us in our sickness : but still the first and chief of all is Jesus Christ . 

3.  I do not exclude the power of God the Father , or of God the holy Ghost : but because I find that by diseases God doth execute great judgements in the world , and that he is pleased to make great use of these in his government , both of his Church , and of his enemies ; and that the Father hath committed all judgement to the Son , Joh. 5.22 . and because this command and government is ascribed to Christ in the Text , therefore I shall frequently mention the name and authority of Jesus Christ , God Redeemer , in this case . 

Now in the handling of the Doctrine , I shall follow this familiar method . 

1.  I shall explain the terms . 2.  I shall show for what ends Jesus Christ doth thus cause and command diseases . Lastly , I shall make Use and Application . 

For the first : In the explication , I shall tell you what I mean by sicknesses ; and then explain the exercise of Christ's government and command of diseases , in those acts of it which are mentioned in the Text , viz. his commanding diseases to go and come , and do this . 

By sicknesses I mean all those evils which are sent by Christ to disease the bodies of living men and women : The author of diseases is Jesus Christ ; the formal nature of them is their diseasing the bodies of men , depriving them of health , strength , ease , etc. and afflicting them with pain and grief , etc. the subjects of these sicknesses are the bodies of living men and women : hereby they are distinguished from the wounds and troubles of the soul so far as they are only spiritual ; but those bodily diseases which are the effects of the wounds and wasting of the soul , are also comprehended herein ; they are hereby distinguished also from that corruption which corrupts the body after death ; and herein are employed all manner of bodily diseases , as wounds , hurts , sores , breaking of bones , etc.  I shall speak of these under this formal consideration , as Jesus Christ is the cause , and ruler , and healer of them , and so they come within the subject of Divinity , and not of Medicine or Chirurgery . 

I now come to explain the exercise of Christ's government of diseases in those three particulars mentioned in the Text.  

1.  Christ bids diseases go , and they go . Take the meaning of this , 1.  In general , 2.  In some particulars . 

First , in general : these words , Go , and they go , are words whereby God works what he speaks ; he immediately creates what he commands , like those words at the creation : Let there be light , and there was light : thus he spoke , and it was done , Psal . 33.9 . and so the meaning is , that it is the will and power of God , which causeth all diseases to come upon us . Hence David calls the people's falling into the Pestilence , a falling into the hand of God , 2 Sam. 24.14 . Let us fall into the hand of the Lord : and in his own visitation he cries out , Psal . 38.2 . Thy hand presseth me sore . And Psal . 39.10 . I am consumed by the blow of thy hand . Beloved , God hath a heavy hand , he gives a great blow ; what is the greatest man in the world , when God can strike him to hell at a blow ? So sicknesses are called Gods arrows , Job 6.4 . The arrows of the Almighty are within me . Psal . 38.2 . Thy arrows stick fast in me . God hath his Quiver full of these Arrows , full of the Pestilence , of Fevers , and Dropsies , and Consumptions , and all manner of Diseases ; and he shoots these Arrows into our Families , Friends and Children ; and none but himself can pull them out : as the Keeper shoots his barbed Arrow into the Deer , and he runs , and leaps , and lies down , but the Arrow sticks still : so God shoots , suppose a Consumption into the lungs of a man , or the Gout into the limbs of a man ; and the poor man walks , and eats , and sleeps , but the Arrow sticks still : Friends pull , and Physicians pull ; but he may say with David , Thy arrows stick fast in me . Thus , beloved , all diseases are subject to the will of God , so as to go upon any man at his appointment . Sinner , if thou wilt not do the Will of God thyself , God hath the Stone , Gout , Strangury , and million of Diseases more , to do his will upon thee : for as it 's observable that there is a passive obediential power in every creature , to yield to the will and power of God to be what he will , as a stone to be turned into a child of Abraham : So there is an active obediential power in every creature , whereby it is ready to be an instrument of God's power to do what he will : if he say to the earth , Open thy mouth , and swallow up such a company ; it presently opens , and becomes a great grave to bury them all alive , as in that dreadful judgement mentioned , Numb . 16.  So if God say to the thunderbolt , Smite such a person , he is presently shattered in pieces ; and in the same cases the heavens , seas , winds , fire , and all creatures obey him : so that if God set on a fly , a spider , an hair of the head against a man , all the care and power in the world cannot save him . So , my brethren , if God command the Pestilence , Fever , small-pox , to go into such a City , or such a Family , or upon such a person , they presently fasten upon them , though all the world be against it . 

more particularly in Gods bidding diseases go , and they go , there is employed these five things . 

First , He commands whatsoever diseases he will to go , and they go ; the Centurion hath his hundred of Soldiers and he sends whom he will , and he goes : so our Lord of hosts hath as many sicknesses as he himself will make at his command , and whichsoever he appoints to go , it presently goes : Beloved , many cry out of their diseases , as the Church of her sorrows , Lam. 1.12 . Is there any sorrow like my sorrow ! is there any sickness like my sickness ! we are too apt to complain with the Israelites , that the way of the Lord is not equal , Ezek. 18.25 . We are forward to judge the best of ourselves , and the worst of our afflictions : but we must know , that God doth in great justice and wisdom choose and single out what diseases he will visit us with ; he corrects with judgement , Jer. 10.24 . and therefore God cheques the impatience of Job thus , Job 40.8 . Will thou disannul my judgement ? wilt thou make nothing of my judgement , which in wisdom and counsel I exercise in all my visitations ? So that whatever disease comes upon us , our hearts and wills should agree with the Will of God therein : for the difference betwixt thy affliction and others , is made by the Wisdom and Will of Christ ; he hath chosen and appointed this , as the fittest disease for thee ; and it is a sign thou wilt be discontent with another affliction , if thou quarrel with this : therefore labour to be so filled with the Will of Christ in thy visitation , as to conclude that this is the best sickness for thee , and the fittest disease for thee ; and this is the good servant , which Christ in wisdom hath sent to do him service upon thee , and to bring him glory from thee . 

2.  To whomsoever Christ bids diseases go , they go ; as when the Centurion commands his servant to go , it is implied that he appoints him whither to go . So ( my brethren ) as God doth pick and choose which arrows he will shoot , so he doth not , like the man in the Syrian Camp , 1 Kings 22.34 . draw his bow at a venture , but in great wisdom marks , and singles out the persons in whom he will strike these arrows . See Psal . 91.7 . A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousands at thy right hand : but it shall not come nigh unto thee ; whereby it appears that God directs and determines the Pestilence to whom it shall go , and the same power he hath over all other diseases ; which are the instruments of his power to do his Will : and this is clear ; for every instrument is overruled , and limited by the will and power of him who works with it ; so that although there be an equal aptness in the instrument to do one thing as well as another , yet it is determined in its work , according to the pleasure of him that guide's it : as if a man go with an axe into the wood to fallen his trees , there is an equal aptness in the axe to cut down one tree as well as another ; but it is at the pleasure , and in the power of him that works with it , to determine which tree shall stand , and which shall fall . So ( my brethren sicknesses are the instruments of God's power to do his will , and are equally apt to disease one as well as another ; but they being all in his hands , and overruled and guided by him , they only go and afflict those to whom he sends and appoints them : God sends the Pestilence into a City ; now the hand of God carries it into what street , or family , or person he will : It is observable , that God makes great use of diseases to do his Will , and to serve his design in the ruin of his enemies , and salvation of his people ; and therefore they must needs be ordered by God , where they may work most for his glory ; as for example , God sees how men of the earth ( as great worldlings are called , Psal . 10. ult . ) fill a Nation or Country either with Error and Heresy , or with Atheism and Profaneness ; and these men lift up the horn on high , Psal . 75.5 . crying , Who is lord over us ? Psal . 12.4 . as if neither God nor man durst speak to them : now it 's for God's honour to show himself above such ; and therefore he baffles Job with this argument , That he can look on every one that is proud , and abase him ; and that he can tread down the wicked in his place . O you proud Nimords , you mighty Hunters , you are out of your place , you must come lower ; God will have you under his feet shortly , and will tread you down in your place . See Job 40.11 , 12.  Now as a proof of this power and glory of God , he often sends a Fever , or a Consumption , or some other disease , and then down falls the great Gallant groaning under the power and torture of his sickness ; and then look what a sight is here : here are magnificent Buildings , pleasant Gardens pampered Horses , etc. but the great Master lies languishing in the midst of all : and now the great talk of this mighty man is come to this , Lo , this is the man that made not God his strength , but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness . Again , sometimes God looks upon a beautiful person ; and sees him , as it were , turning his own Fancy into a Looking-glass , wherein he is always looking , and admiring , and pleasing himself with his beauty : Well ( saith God ) to a Consumption , Go , and wither yonder pretty flower ; and it goes , and presently his beauty consumes away like a moth : Or else saith God to the small-pocks , or some other disease , Go , and it goes , and scorns and shames his beauty : and now the wounds stink , and are corrupt , and the body is filled with a loathsome disease , Psal . 38.5 , 7. and there is burning instead of beauty , as it is said in another case ; Isa . 3.24 . So sometimes a Minister hath but one or two malicious enemies in a Parish ; and God commands a disease to fetch away them : and what welcome such have in eternity , they are like to know best , that have a mind to try it . 

Sometimes a Minister hath a gracious man or woman in a Parish , which are to him as that gracious couple , Aquila and Priscilla were to Paul , his helpers in the Lord , Rom. 16.3 . and when many a malicious Atheist life's , it is the good will of God that they die . 

Sometimes parents have but one child , and God denies to lend them that . Sometimes there is but one Life in a Living , and a disease comes by the appointment of Christ , and spares all the rest of the Family , and takes away that ; but one good Abijah in a house , and God calls away him : Thus all diseases go to whomsoever they are sent and appointed by Jesus Christ . 

Thirdly , Whensoever Christ commands a disease to go , it goes : This is also plainly implied in the Centurion's speech ; for if he have authority to bid his soldiers go , it must be at his own pleasure , when he will bid them go : now it is clear that Jesus Christ hath this authority over all diseases ; both because he is a free agent , and therefore works when he will upon his creatures ; and because every thing whose acting depends on the power and pleasure of another , works only then when it is his pleasure to work with it : as an arrow only fly's then when the archer will shoot it ; so diseases , which as you have heard are God's arrows , can only hit us , and hurt us , when it is Gods will to shoot them into our bodies . Beloved , God is the Lord of our times : the belief of which comforted David , when his enemies were conspiring his death , Psal . 31.13 , 14 , 15.  I trusted in the Lord , I said , thou art my God , my times are in thy hands , not in my enemy's hands : It is sweet satisfaction to see clearly our times of life , and peace , and health , and sickness in God's hands ; we shall never be sick till our Father be willing to make us sick ; he fills our times with what changes he william It is observable , that in Gods working towards Nations , or Families , or persons , he ha‚óèh in his determinate counsel appointed an unchangeable method of providence , and in infinite wisdom hath set a sit nick of time for every dispensation ; so that the glory and beauty of the Providence is much seen in the season of it : So in this case God hath set the times for the several changes in the life of man , Job 7.1 . Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth ? and in all diseases , his wisdom , and power , and justice , and mercy is glorified in the season of the Visitation . Sometimes God smites a child in the womb , and the poor mother carries a dead corpse instead of a living child : And thus the body and soul are no sooner united , but presently parted again ; and so multitudes fly from the womb into heaven and hell . 

Some die in their full strength , Job 21.23 . We see many when they were most like to live , they presently die ; and like the strings of an instrument , break when they are best in tune . 

Sometimes when men stand upon the foot of pride , Psal . 36.11 . they are suddenly taken in their pride , Psal . 59.11 . and so fall suddenly from the top of pride to the bottom of hell . See a fit instance of this , Acts 12.21 , 22 , 23.  Herod makes a popular Oration , and the flattering multitude shout and cry , It is the voice of God , and not of man : and the Lord suddenly smites him with a strange disease , and there lies the Royal Orator , as it were , in the same breath , deified by men , and devoured by worms . 

Sometimes a Father is too fond of a child , and the very might and strength of his heart , which might be better exercised in the love and service of God and Jesus Christ , is vainly wasted and spent in the inordinate love and delight which he takes in his child : then God bids a disease go , and it presently leaves a fatherless child , or a childeless father . 

Sometimes , when godly men are ripe for glory , so that with Paul they have finished their course , 2 Tim. 4.7 . then God doth finish their time , and sends a sickness as a messenger to fetch them home , as a shock of corn in its season , Job 5.26 . There are multitudes of other seasons , wherein God chooseth to visit his people ; which considerate Christians may observe , and dilate , and amplify upon in their own thoughts . 

4.  How often soever Christ commands diseases to go , they go : this we may also gather from the Centurion's speech : for by virtue of the same authority by which he bids his soldiers go once , he bids them go as oft as he sees reason to command them . So by the same power that Jesus Christ causeth diseases at any time , he can cause them as often as he will : for his power being unchangeable , is not spent in any work ; but it is the same after as before , Heb. 13.8 . Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever : and his power being infinite , there is never any thing to hinder , but he can do what he william Hence many times diseases come thick upon us , Job 10.17 . thou renewest thy witnesses against me : by witnesses he „Äà‚óä„Äâ diseases , as well as other afflictions , which God renews at his pleasure . So Job 16.14 . He breaketh me with breach upon breach : when persons are sick , we usually say o‚óè them as David speaks of himself , Psal . 38.8 . They are sore broken : and it is God that thus breaketh them with breach upon breach ; with one breach after another . Beloved , when God begins to trouble us , we are usually like Mariners on the seas , one wave of affliction comes rolling after another : Perhaps God first smites us in a beast , then in a child , then in ourselves . David elegantly describes this , Psal . 42.7 . Deep calleth unto deep , at the noise of thy water-spouts : all thy waves and billows are gone over me : As at the noise of thunder or rain from the clouds , which are Gods water-spouts , the Brooks , as it were , call on the Clouds , Come and fill us ; and the Rivers call unto the Brooks , Come ye and raise us : Or , as in a terrible storm at Sea , one wave calls to another , Come and roll after me ; and that to another , Come and follow me : so one deep affliction calls to another to follow it ; the Ague cries to the Fever , follow me ; and the Fever to the Consumption , follow me ; and the Consumption to Death , follow me . And thus all God's waves and billows go over us ; so that a man may say with Heman , Psal . 88.7 . thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves . And thus the day of our life is like a stormy day , wherein are some shining gleams , and then storms follow one another all the day ; and therefore as soldiers in a garrison , when they have gallantly beaten back one storm of the enemy , do not presently throw down their arms , and dismantle the garrison ; but they make up their breaches , and keep up their Guards and Sentinels , to be ready for a more desperate assault : So when one affliction is past , when one disease is healed , let us be prepared for another , till we have accomplished our warfare . I refer you for more of this , to the Application . 

Lastly , How long soever God appoints a disease to stay , it will continue upon us : this is also implied in the Centurion's speech . For by the same Authority that he commands a Soldier to go to a place , he can appoint him to stay till he give order for his return : So Jesus Christ can as long as he will , continue the exercise of the same power which first caused the disease , upon the exercise of which must needs follow the continuance of the disease : and therefore we often see , that some man continues in a sickly and dying condition for many years together , so that their lives hang in doubt , as it is said , Deut. 28.66 . they live , as it were , between the two Worlds , being neither w‚óèll enough to live , nor sick enough to die . This ( it seems ) was Hemans case , Psal . 88.15 . I am afflicted , and ready to die from my youth up : Thus Job tells us , cap. 7.3 . I am made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me ; whilst some are in their sweet and refreshing sleep , they little dream what wearisome nights others spend on their beds of langushing , crying out with Job in the next verse , When I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tossing to and from , unto the dawning of the day : Many may cry out in their long and tedious sickness with Hezekiah , Isa . 38.12 . I am cut off with pining sickness , from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me : This is the sad case or many , they eat , and drink , and sleep , and walk abroad ; but they carry about them perhaps a Hectic , or Flux , or Consumption , whereby God is from day even to night making an end of them : O look about thee man , and consider , What hast thou to take too , when the hand of God hath made an end of thee ! when thou findest thy heart blessing thyself in thy wealth , friends , and other enjoyments , go alone a while , and tell thy soul , This is but a poor portion : when ( as to my enjoyment of it ) I am spitting it away , and sweeting it away , and it goes away in the very filth and excrements of my body every day . Beloved , it hath cost me some serious thoughts , to see an irresistible disease feeding upon a near and dear friend : Friends provide the wholesomest Diet , Physicians prescribe the fittest Medicines ; many Closets , and Families , and Congregations are full of fervent prayers for their health ; but still God bids the disease stay , and waste , and eat up the life of the friend : and as Job speaks , He is in one mind , and who can turn him ? Job 23.13 . and he taketh away , and who can hinder him ? Job 9.12 . 

So much for the explication of the first particular : God commands diseases to go , and they go . 

Secondly , He commands diseases to come , and they come : As the Centurion bids his soldier come , and he comes : so Christ can call away a disease from a sick person when he will : and this is clear , for God can at his pleasure suspend the exercise of his power , which was the cause of our sickness , and so the disease must needs cease : and all the creature-causes of diseases must cease to be , when God denies the work of his power , which caused their being : and they cannot work to disease and trouble us , if God will not work with them : and besides , he can at his pleasure exercise that power which causeth our health , and can work with Angels , Physicians , Medicines , Food , or any other things , which he shall please to use as the instruments and means of health to us : and therefore he tells his people , Exod. 15.26 . I am the God that heals thee . And this is acknowledged by the Leper , and practised by Christ , Mat. 8.2 , 3.  Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean , ( saith the Leper ) Christ answers , I will , be thou clean . Beloved , God hath deliverances from sickness , as well as from all other afflictions , at command , Psal . 44.4 . thou art my King , OH Lord , command deliverances for Jacob : So ( saith David ) when the Water-spouts of affliction came pouring upon him : The Lord will command his loving kindness in the daytime : This power of God appears by that of David , Psal . 68.20 . To God the Lord belong the issues from death : all the issues and means to escape death , belong to God : when a man falls into a dangerous sickness , he falls into the hands of death , he sticks as it were in the very jaws of death ; as it is said of Hezekiah , Isa . 38.1 . He was sick unto death . Now in this case there is no visible issue , or escape out of the snares of death : the man himself strives , friends strive , Physicians strive , but there appears no discharge in that war , Eccl. 8.8 . But now God comes in the greatness of his Power , and he makes an issue from death ; and by these things men live , Isa . 38.16 . For God saith to the Fever , to the Small Pocks , to the Consumption , etc.  Come away ; let the Minister live with his People ; let the Father live with his Children ; let the Children live with their Father ; let the Wife live with her Husband : and thus he commands them away , and they are presently gone ; as it is said of the waters , Psal . 104.7 . At his rebuke they fled , and at his voice they hasted away . 

So much for the second particular . 

Thirdly , Whatsoever Christ commands diseases to do , they do it ; they are herein like the Centurion's servant , when his Master bids do this , and he doth it : the meaning of this is , that Jesus Christ by all sicknesses fulfils his own will ; and the reason is , because it is the power of Christ that works in all diseases : Now Christ works by his power according to his will , Eph. 1.11 . He worketh all things according to the counsel of his william Beloved , wherever a disease comes , it hath always some work to do . 1.  Sometimes Christ commands it to fill a man with grievous pain and torment ; so the Centurion's servant here was grievously tormented : and we read , Job 33.19 . He is chastened with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain . This did so torture David , that he roared for the very disquietness of his heart , Psal . 38.8 . And Jobs pain was so great , that he saith , Job 16.12 . God hath taken me by my neck , and shaken me to pieces . And Sirs , although now we sit , and walk , and eat , and sleep at our ease , yet our bodies may be breeding those diseases , which may shortly cause torturing pain and anguish to come upon us , as Travel upon a Woman with child . 

Sometimes God bids a disease to waste and wither a man in the prime and flower of his age , and he doth it : Many that are now enclosed in their own fat , Psal . 17.10 . and cover their faces with fatness , and make collops of fat on their flanks , Job 15.27 . yet when sickness comes , they are strangely altered ; then their flesh is consumed that it cannot be seen , and their bones that were not seen , stick out , Job 33.21 . then such a man may cry out with David , I may tell all my bones . O what a sad case is this man in ! he looks on his silver and gold , and they shine upon him ; and upon his precious jewels , and they sparkle and twinkle upon him ; and upon his pleasant pastures , and green meadows , and fruitful fields , and they smile upon him : but he looks upon himself , and his own body , and there he sees a ghastly spectacle . O now if the face of a reconciled God in Christ do not shine , what a fearful condition doth the poor man lie in ? 

Again , sometimes God commands a disease to take away a man's appetite and stomach to his meat , and it doth it , so that his life abhors bread , and his soul dainty meat , Job 33.20 . So Psalm 107.18 . and this is the sad case of many a man , who hath with Dives fared sumptuously every day , Luke 16.19 . But now poor wretch , he hath money enough to buy meat ; but all the world cannot purchase him a stomach . 

Sometimes men are just finishing their design of hurting God's people , and Christ commands a disease to stop them . Thus Jeroboam's hand was stretched out against the Prophet , and God withered it presently , and the good Prophet was delivered . See 1 Kings 13.  

But to conclude , sometimes God bids a disease tumble such a soul into hell , and it doth it ; and the poor friends are winding up the Christless body , when the Devils are worrying the damned soul . 

Sometimes he commands a sickness to lose a Saint out of the earth into heaven , and it doth it ; and here lies the ghastly jewel , the redeemed body , but thither fly's the blessed and glorified soul . 

I now come to show you diverse of the main Ends of Christ's exercising this government of diseases , in commanding them to go and come , and do what he william  

I shall mention these seventeen Ends.  

First , To convince us of the great evil of sin , which is the meritorious cause of diseases . I conceive that the understanding of a man cannot comprehend the evil of sin ; that is , he cannot know it quantum est cognoscibile , so far as it may be known , or so far as nothing of the evil of it is unknown : I think none can know it so but God ; because a man cannot know all the holiness and goodness of God , which sin is against , nor all the wrath of God , which sin deserves : yet a man may by the power and light of God's Spirit be so far convinced of the evil of sin , as to judge it the greatest evil in the world , and therefore to loathe it , and abhor it most , and to desire more to be saved from it , then from any evil : And this is one great use of all afflictions , thus to convince us of the evil of sin , Jer. 2.19 . thine own wickedness shall correct thee ; know therefore , and see , that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God. And this God intends by visiting us with sicknesses , Job 33.27 . He looketh upon men ( meaning in their sickness ; for this was the case mentioned in the foregoing verses ) and if any say , I have sinned , and it profited me not , etc.  Beloved , God stands looking and harkening at your sick beds , to see and hear , if upon deep conviction , and by sincere confession , any of you say , I have sinned : this God looks for in his Visitations upon us : We find this to be the effect of David's sickness , Psal . 38.3 , 4.  There is no soundness in my flesh , because of thy anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones , because of my sin : For mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy burden ; they are too heavy for me . Beloved , people would not be so fond of their sins , if they saw the diseases and dangers which they bring upon them , as a man would not be greedy of the daintiest meat , if he knew it were mixed with Ratsbane ; nor be proud of the finest clotheses , if he knew they were infected with the Pestilence : So if people saw the Plague , Pocks , Dropsy , Fever , and the Consumption , in their pride , and oaths , and lies , and drunkenness , and covetousness , it would make them afraid of sin , as well as of sickness : and therefore look not upon sin as it appears in your honours , profits and pleasures , as it appears at an Alehouse , Maypole , or Maurice-dance , or Cockpit , or Bear-bait , or Stage-play ; for there thou canst not see sin for its pleasures ; but look upon thyself on a bed of languishing , and there see thy sins standing in order before thee ; and then tell me what fruit thou hast in these things : Look upon thyself as hanging over the lake of brimstone , and then call thy drunken Companions about thee , and bid them pour out their flagons , and quaff off their cups , and see whether all these can make thee merry : when the flames of hell begin to catch and kindle in thy guilty soul , call in thy lies , and injustice , to bring thee thy treasures of wickedness , and lay them under thy pillow , and see whether they can bring thee ease , when Death , and Hell , and the day of Judgement stand present before thee . 

And ( my brethren ) it is observable , that when we sin in our sickness , we should see far more evil in it then as it is the meritorious cause of that disease : as we should look further into a sickness , then as it causeth present aches and pains in the body , we should see that Death and Eternity which comes after ; so we should see more evil and danger in sin , then as it brings such a disease ; for the evil of it is not spent in that : therefore we should look upon it as provoking God to punish us with diseases , and with death , and hell , which diseases are losing us into . 

The second End , to convince us of the vanity of the creature : now we are truly convinced of the vanity of the creature , when we judge it to be empty of that good which must free a sinful man from misery , and fill him with true happiness : It must needs be a vanity , when a man may be miserable with it , and happy without it . Now Christ appoints diseases as means to convince us of this vanity of the creature : for , as one saith wittily , the world is the Devil's Chessboard , wherein a man can neither move forward nor backward , but the Devil attaches him with some creature or other : and indeed we are so full of the spirit of the world , as it 's called , 1 Cor. 2.12 . which doth so fill our hearts with the world , that God , and Christ , and Heaven , and Salvation , are nothing to us ; and therefore this sin is called , a denying God that is above , Job 31.24 , 25 , 28. and Agur tells us , that when a man is full of the world , he is apt to deny God , and to say , Who is the Lord ? prov. 30.9 . O what poor scornful thoughts a covetous , proud , secure worldling hath of God , and Christ , and Saints , and Ordinances , and Salvation ! Now this is one great use of sicknesses , to convince a man of the vanity of the world : and this is a most convincing argument ; for I dare challenge all the worldlings which the world itself can own , to name me that earthly creature , and tell me what I shall call it , which can heal the wounds of a guilty conscience , or can take out the sting of death ; or of which a man can truly say , Here is a treasure which a lump of phlegm cannot take from me : If thou canst not say this of the creature , I grant thou mayst use it for thy good ; but be ruled by a friend , never choose it for thy portion . 

But more particularly , we may hereby be convinced of the vanity of these five things . 

First , Of the vanity of ourselves : Sickness moved David to beg wisdom of God , to know how frail he was , Psal . 39.4 . and this made Job compare himself to a leaf , and to the dry stubble , and to a flower and shadow , Job 13.25 . and Cap. 14.2 . and we read , that this is the use of sickness , to hide pride from man , Job 33.17 . that is , to take it quite away , to be seen no more : and if we did look on every thing which we are usually proud of , as it will prove on a sick bed , or deathbed , it would be an effectual means to abase us , and to hide pride from us . Beloved , it is a most precious thing for a man to be filled with the knowledge and sense of his own emptiness and vanity : The Kingdom of heaven is unchangeably entailed upon all such , Mat. 5.3 . Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven . Hereby a man is sweetly qualified for every duty : Faith never acts with more integrity and strength , then when it acts from the belief of a man's own emptiness ‚ñ™ for when self is most denied , Christ is most acknowledged and believed ; then doth a man most heartily and strongly receive and rest upon Christ to justify and to save him , when he sees what a guilty , condemned , lost wretch he is in himself ; and when he sees what a weak helpless creature he is , then doth he most trust to the infinite power of Jesus Christ : and this also doth exceedingly endear his heart in love to God , when he sees that God is so good , and so full of grace , and love , and mercy , as to choose , and call , and pardon , and save such a vile and loathsome creature as he ; then repentance is most inward and spiritual , when a man with Job , abhors himself , and reputes in dust and ashes , Job 42.6 . and this fills the heart with prayer ; for prayer begs of God what a man wants in himself : therefore when a man sees himself poor , and empty of all good , and knows that he cannot be supplied from himself , then doth he pray to be filled with the fullness of God. Now , I say , sickness is a special means to convince a man of his emptiness and vanity ; for hereby a man is left bare and empty of all those creature-comforts which seemed to fill him before , and now he sees that nothing will fill him but grace and glory ; and that there is nothing in him to make up this fullness . 

Secondly , To convince us of the vanity of great men . O what is a Prince , or a Nobleman , or Gentleman , when the Pox , or the Fever , or the Consumption will insult over him , and scorn him , and make nothing of him ; and there is nothing in him to resist or remove these , because the irresistible Arm and Power of God works in them ; and therefore he may cry in his sickness , Help friend's , help riches , help honours : But if God do not withdraw his anger , the proud helpers stoop under him , Job 9.13 . The places of the world are called slippery places , Psal . 73.18 . and they that know what God is , and what sin , and what the creature is , know by the cause's the slipperiness of them , and see you sliding down as fast as you are rising up . And tell me , you great men of the earth , where is the place which you can name and say , Here I can stand , and cannot slip into hell ! I tell you , there are standers by can see your magnificent buildings situated on the borders of hell , your beds made at the very mouth of hell , your tables spread over the pit of hell , your horses prancing with you , and Coaches rattling with you at the very edge and brink of hell : Ah great vanities ! wherever you are , the mouth of hell is gaping upon you , and there are thousands of diseases and deaths to lose you in : We may hence then conclude with David , Psal . 62.9 . That men of high degree are a lie and vanity ; and if we weigh nothing in the balance with them , they will prove lighter than nothing , and vanity . 

Thirdly , The vanity of strong men : Solomon tells us , prov. 20.29 . The glory of young men is their strength : and men are apt to be very proud of their strength , that they can leap , and lift , and run , and wrestle , and fight , and excel others in bodily exercises : But what is all this strength , when God comes upon thee by sickness , and with his strong hand opposeth himself against thee ? Job 30 21.  Thy bones are now full of marrow and strength ; but when a disease comes , thy strength will be dried up like a Potsherd , or pitcher baked and burned in the fire , Psal . 22.15 . therefore when thy heart is lifted up in the sense of thy bodily strength , consider , Hast thou an arm like God ? or art thou stronger than he ? canst thou fight with a Fever ? or wrestle with the Falling sickness ? or outrun a Consumption ? no , no : this conflict will prove like that of Jobs with the Leviathan , to teach thee to remember the battle , and do no more . David was a man of such strength , that he tells us , that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms , Psal . 18.34 . but when he came to grapple with sickness , than he was so feeble and sore broken , that saith he , Psalm 22.14 . I am poured out like water , and all my bones are out of joint . Besides , if thou live to it , old age will creep upon thee shortly : and then the keepers of the house , viz. the hands and arms , will tremble : and the strong men , viz. the limbs that support thee , will bow , as we read‚óè Eccles . 12.13 . and at last death shall devour thy strength , Job 18.13 . and the very worms of the earth will be too strong for thee : Let not therefore the mighty man glory in his might , Jer. 9.23 . for as David infers from God's wasting men with sickness , Psal . 39.5 . Verily every man at his best estate is altogether vanity . 

4.  To convince us of the vanity of children ; these indeed are sweet comforts , and it is a great mercy to be instruments in God's way of bringing such an excellent creature as a man-child or woman-childe into the world : and I have often thought , that when some do take too much pleasure in a horse , or in a dog , as a spaniel , or the like , that it 's a great blessing to parents to have such objects of their delight , as their own children . Hence saith Job , OH that I were as in months past ; ‚Äî when my children were about me ! Job ‚óè9 . 2 . ‚Äî 6. and truly though the fare be but course , yet it makes it more pleasant to have these plants about the table : These are indeed sweet flowers ; but a sickness comes , and then , like a Posy , they whither in thy bosom ; so that we must conclude with Solomon , Eccles . 11. ult . that childhood and youth is vanity . 

Lastly , of the vanity of wealth and riches : O how bare will sicknesses and death make a man ! Sirs , a dead corpse is but a poor thing : How poor doth a rich man go out of the world , when sickness and death hath stripped him of all his enjoyments ! and then as he came naked out of his mother's womb , so naked must he return : Job 1.21 . Eccles . 5.15 . 1 Tim. 6.7 . look on the world with your hearts filled with the thoughts of sickness and death , and then you will see the vanity of it ; look on thyself as stretched on a bed of languishing , see thyself lying in a Coffin , or in a Grave , or standing before the judgement-seat of Christ ; and then see how all the riches of the world appear before thee : If a man look on his stately house and buildings , what a pleasant dream is he in to see a sweet situation , wholesome air , convenient rooms , etc. but let him see death coming up into the windows ; and then , what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ? So when a man is feeding himself with the pleasant thoughts of a feast , let him remember that death is in the Pot , and that death stands between the cup and the lip ; and then he will not be so apt to make his belly his God , like those , Phil. 3.19 . 

So when men are proud of their Pedigrees , and take pleasure in reckoning up their Kindred , and telling of their Families ; let them take in these with the rest of their Relations , saying to corruption , thou art our father , and to the worms , You are our mothers and sisters , Job 17.14 . and this will show all to be but noble dust , and rich earth , and great vanity . 

So much for the second End of Christ's visiting men with sickness . 

End 3  To fill our hearts with the sense of death : Sicknesses are fit means for this purpose , for sickness itself is a kind of death : for death is a privation of life , a separation from that which is our life : And now we know we have , as it were , a life in food , friends and estates , etc. and sickness parts and separates us from these ; it stops the passage betwixt these and a man , so that the pleasure and comfort of these cannot come to the man for his disease ; but the man stands , as it were , betweeen the two worlds , at the end of this world , and at the beginning of the other , and all creature enjoyments are shut up from him ; and the great things of eternity stand open before him : So that what the Apostle speaks of persecution , is for the same reason true of sickness , 2 Cor. 4.12 . Death worketh in us : when sickness comes , death works apace ; it works away your health , it works away your ease , it works away your stomaches , it works away your strength , and at last works you into your graves . Hence we find that the godly in Scripture were full of the thoughts of death in the time of their sickness . David prays on his sick bed that his visitation may be sanctified ; to this purpose , Psal . 39.4 . Lord make me to know my end ‚Äî and this improvement made Heman of his sickness , when the wounds of his soul caused wasting and diseases in his body , Psal . 88.3 , 4 , 5.  For my soul is full of troubles , and my life draws nigh unto the grave ‚Äî and this was good Hezekiah his frame in his sickness , Isa . 38.10 , 11 , 12.  I said in the cutting off my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave ; I am deprived of the residue of my years : I said , I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord in the land of the living : I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the earth . Mine age is departed , and is removed from me , as a shepherd's tent : I have cut off like a weaver my life . He will cut me off with pining sickness ; from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me . So when Job was almost throttled with a disease ; for , saith he , Job 30.8 . It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat : He makes this gracious use of his Visitation , vers . 23.  I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living . So that by all we see , that sickness is a special means to fill our hearts with the thoughts of death . 

End 4.  To fill the heart with the knowledge and sense of God. Beloved , our hearts are apt to be senseless of God as he appears in the ordinary course of his Providence and mercy ; therefore God often manifests himself in the crosses and changes of our life , which makes us more apt to inquire into the cause of such alterations : as when corn grows in its ordinary course , first the blade , than the ear , than the full corn in the ear , few observe the good Providence of God herein ; but when God by frost , hail or blasting , destroys the fruits of the field , so that it neither yields bread to the eater , nor seed to the sour , hereby his hand is more remarkably seen and observed : so whilst God continues men in health , and ease , and strength , few are sensible of his goodness herein : but when he fills their bodies with aches , pains and diseases , than his power and providence is more observed in such visitations . Hence saith Job , cap. 10.17 . thou renewest thy witnesses against me : as God's mercies are called his witnesses , his doing good , and giving rain , and fruitful seasons , Act. 14.17 . so sicknesses , and other judgements , are fitly called Gods witnesses , the use of which is to declare and testify of God to us : O , saith the Pestilence , He is a terrible God that sent me ; and saith the Fever , He is a mighty God that sent me ; and saith the Consumption , He is a just God that sent me : If you will not receive the testimony of God's Ministers , and of his Mercies , will you receive the testimony of your afflictions ! certainly every sickness , if the conscience be awakened , will testify the same things of God and Christ , which Ministers preach to you . Consider further , I pray you , that there is a more special aptness in diseases to convince the heart of man , then in diverse other things which yet will leave us inexcusable : as it is the use of outward mercies to commend the power , and wisdom , and care , and goodness of God to ours heart ; and a man may improve every mercy so , as out of it to fill his heart with God ; but there are snares and temptations in these to steal the heart from God , and therefore men are apt to lose God , and to forget him , when they are most full of these mercies : So in injuries form men , we should see the hand of God. From men , which are thy hand , OH Lord , saith David , Psal . 17.14 . but we are usually so filled with anger and revenge towards men , that we forget the hand of God.  

But now in a sickness , the name of God and the hand of God is more clearly known and seen , so that there is no such provision for lust in a sickness , as in the mercies : here is no profit , nor credit , nor pleasure for lust to feed upon ; and here is no instrument to quarrel with : will a man be angry with a Fever , or be revenged on a Consumption ? no , we must own the Power and Will of God , who is the cause of the visitation . 

End 5.  Christ sends diseases to turn men from sin and the world , unto himself . Hence God complains of the want of this , as a great disappointment , Amos 4.10 . I have sent among you the Pestilence ( to cause you turn to me ) yet have ye not returned unto to me , saith the Lord : and therefore it 's observable , that in a sickness God doth blast that which makes the snare to hold our hearts from God : as we know , much of the life and strength of pride , and covetousness and other lusts is in the profits , and pleasures , and preferments of the world ; now what are all these to a sick man ? his sickness doth , as it were , block up all provision from the flesh ; and now he may see that none but God and Jesus Christ can answer the necessity of his soul : and therefore let me ask you , What is the best thing which you would propound to a friend on a sick bed , who is just upon his flight into eternity ? will you provide him a sumptuous feast , or a rich suit of clotheses , or offer him some place of preferment ? no , no , show him a God and Christ to save his poor soul ; show him a happiness which will make him blessed , when he is turned out of all which sickness and death can take from him . Moreover , it appears that sickness is appointed by God as a means for our conversion , because this and every affliction calls us to do that which the word calls us unto : Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest , OH Lord , and teachest him out of thy law . This makes a man a blessed man , when in his chastening he is full of the teaching of the Law. Hence we are commanded to hear the rod , and who hath appointed it , Micah 6.9 . Beloved , the rod speaks as well as strikes ; and we should hear the rod , as well as feel the rod : now what doth the rod speak ? I answer , The rod speaks the mind and will of God , who smites with it : the rod and the word speak the same language ; therefore we should see our sickness full of Scripture . O , saith the Dropsy , Turn to the God that sent me ; and saith the Ague , Make your peace with God that sent me : And this is the voice of every disease which comes upon us : And therefore consider , that God doth often so bless and sanctify a sickness to us , that it is a means to turn the heart to God , and causeth us to bring forth the fruit of many other dispensations : as for example , God sends to allure us by his mercies , Hos . 11.4 . I drew them with the cords of a man , with the bands of love ; there are secret cords and bands in all our mercies , to draw and to bind our hearts to God ; and when we find ourselves nourished with meat , and refreshed with sleep , we should find a secret virtue in these mercies to join our hearts to God ; but God useth this means with many one , but the soul yet abides in his sins : then God sendeth another servant ; he sends a faithful Minister to call him to himself , and a faithful friend to persuade him to come ; but yet the poor sinner will not come : Well , saith God , I will yet try another messenger ; Go Fever , Go Ague , etc.  Now these are often so blessed , that all the former dispensations work afresh : Now he remembers his mercies , and Sermons , and counsels , and they all work so effectually , that the poor sinner is savingly converted unto God.  

End 6.  To convince people of the necessity and excellency of godly Ministers . Beloved , God's Ministers are the strength of King and Kingdom , the very Militia of the Land : The charets of Israel's , and the horsemen thereof , 2 Kin. 2.12 . The Apostle shows how we should esteem godly Ministers , 1 Cor. 4.1 . Let a man so accounted of us , as the Ministers of Christ : If we esteem Ministers aright , we should prise them as Ministers , prise them for that which makes them differ , and wherein they are separated from other men ; as if you would truly prise the Lord's day , and call it a delight and honourable , as the Scripture requires , you must esteem it as sanctified and separated from other days , and thereby you shall see it a more holy and blessed day : so if you would prise the Lords Supper , you must esteem the bread and wine as separated from other bread and wine , and as consecrated and sanctified to such a use : so if you would honour an Ambassador from a great King , you do not so much look upon his personal worth , but he is honoured and received as he is sent from the King , and stands in his stead . So , my brethren , if we would prise a Minister aright , look upon him as separated to the Gospel , as clothed with authority to preach the Word , and administer the Sacraments , as one through whose hands God hath in wisdom chosen to transmit the treasures of the Gospel to you , and as one who stands in the stead of Jesus Christ , who is ready to revenge all the affronts that are offered unto him . Now , my brethren , there are no sorts of men so much abhorred by the world , as godly Ministers ; these whom our Saviour calls the salt of the earth , Matth. 5.13 . as if the world of men would be but as a piece of stinking carrion , if it were not for godly Ministers and godly people . And the Apostle tells us , they are unto God a sweet savour in Christ , 2 Cor. 2.15 . yet they are hated , as if they were the loathsomest excrements in the world . This Paul elegantly expresseth , 1 Cor. 4.13 . We are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day . Ministers are loathed , as if they were a curse and plague to the world , and as if they were the nastiest jakes or sink on the earth ; for thus the words in the original , „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ and „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ , imply . But now when God throws a sinner on a bed of sickness , than a faithful Minister is for worth and excellency one of a thousand , Job 33.23 . for the more a man sees his need of those soulsaving mercies , which Christ sends by his Ministers , the more he will prise Ministers themselves : If a man sees what hell is , he will prise Ministers that labour to save him thence : If a man believes what heaven is , he will accounted Ministers precious , who are to be the greatest means under God to bring him thither : If the soul be wounded for sin , then how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things ! Rom. 10.15 . So look on thyself as gasping under sickness at the door of Eternity ; and then see whether thou darest boast , that thou hadst rather hear a Piper then hear a Preacher , or rather set up a Maypole then set up a Minister ; these will prove but poor frolicks , when thou seest nothing but death and hell , and the day of judgement before thee ; thou wilt be glad then to send for these Elders , the Ministers of the Church to pray over thee ; and as fast as thou canst spit in their faces now , thou wouldst be glad then to lick the very dust of their feet , for the least sound comfort that ever dropped from their sanctified lips . 

End 7.  Christ by sicknesses doth further and promote the Salvation of his own people , ( as the following particulars do more fully evince ) and the reason of this is , because Jesus Christ doth every thing to his people as their Saviour , and therefore there is a saving Power and Virtue works from Christ in and through all his dispensations towards them ; as whether a father feed or whip his child , he doth it with the heart of a father , for the good of his child : so if Christ afflict his child , he doth it with the heart of a Saviour , to save his child ; and therefore all God's people may say of their sickness , as Paul in another case , Phil. 1.19 . I know that this shall turn to my salvation . We have full proof of this , 1 Cor. 11.32 . When we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , ( meaning by those sicknesses and weaknesses mentioned in vers . 30 . ‚óè that we should not be condemned with the world , nor go to hell with the world . Hence Tertullian speaking of God's fatherly love in correcting his people , hath this pathetical passage , OH servum illum beatum , cujus emendationi Dominus instat , cui dignatur irasci ! de patienti√¢ , cap. 11.  OH blessed is that servant , for whose correction or amendment the Lord is so earnest , with whom he vouchsafes to be ( so lovingly ) angry . Beloved , it is observable , that God doth not distinguish his people from the wicked , by making them Lords and Ladies , or by filling them with the treasures of the earth : these are not the effects of distinguishing grace ; for a wicked man may have his belly full of these things : Whose belly thou fillest with thy hide treasures : And therefore Job tells us of those that provoke God , that into their hands God brings abundantly of worldly things , Job 12.6 . he brings a whole Empire of the world into the hands of a Nero , or a Turk . But God distinguisheth his people from the world by making them holy and happy : and therefore though the common mercy of God , which brings riches , and honours , and health , etc. doth not so much abound to the godly , yet the distinguishing grace of God , which brings salvation , Tit. 2.11 . never fails ; and therefore when they have many things which hinder their estates , and liberty , and health ; yet nothing shall hinder their salvation , but still the infinite power of Christ is working and prevailing to bring them to heaven . 

End 8.  Christ by sickness doth change his people more and more into his own likeness : So that as the fire melts and softens the gold , and thereby fits it for the stamp ; so these sicknesses soften the hearts of the godly , and thereby fit them to receive the stamp of God's Image . Hence many a Saint comes more full of God from a sick bed , than he did from a Sermon , or Sacrament , for many a day before . To this purpose agrees the saying of learned and holy Rolloc on his sick bed , I am not ashamed ( saith he ) to profess , that I never attained to such a great measure of the knowledge of God , as I have gained by this sickness . The Apostle assures us , that this is God's end in all our corrections , Heb. 12.10 . He chasteneth us for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness . If we loose by corrections one way , as in our health , liberty , or estates ; profit comes in another way , in holiness , in graces , and in comforts . There is a fit proof of this , 2 Cor. 4.16 . Though the outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day . In v. 12. ( as was observed before ) he tells us , that death worketh in them : Death was busily working to take away their lives : Well , saith he , but though the outward man perish , that is , though the body and bodily things perish and decay , yet the inward man , that is , the new man , the spiritual man , is renewed day by day . To apply this to our particular case , we often see , that whilst sickness is withering and wasting the body , the outward man , there comes a newness of life and spirit from Jesus Christ , to quicken and renew the inward man : So that although the outward man be feeble , speech weak , and hands weak , and limbs weak , yet look in the inward man , and you shall see every thing in its prime ; faith strong , and love strong , and patience strong , and comfort strong : so that as the outward man is wasting and falling towards the earth , the inward man is rising and ripening towards heaven . 

End 9  Christ visits his people with sickness , to try whether they will cleave to him notwithstanding he thus visit them . Beloved , you often hear and read of the trials of God's people ; I shall therefore acquaint you what this trial is , whereby you will more clearly understand this end of God's Visitation . A trial is that whereby God puts his people to give a proof and experiment of their graces . As for example , there was a question between God and Satan , concerning the integrity of Job : God testifies of Job , c. 1.8 . That he was a perfect and upright man , one that feared God , and eschewed evil . Satan denies this , and undertakes to prove Job to be an Hypocrite , and a Dissembler , vers . 9 , 10 , 11.  Doth Job fear God for naught ? no marvel if he fear thee ; thou payest him well for it ; thou hast made a hedge about him , that no body must hurt him : but he makes but a Trade of Religion ; do but throw down the hedge about him , and he will quickly throw down his service and obedience ; he will curse thee to thy face . Now upon this , Job is put to the trial : but though in a few hours he is changed from a man of great riches , etc. to a poor Job ; yet still he holds fast his integrity , as God witnesseth of him , Job 2.3 . Afterwards ariseth another question , Whether Job will prove a hypocrite if God visit him with sickness ; for , sa ; i'th' Satan , Job 2.5 . Touch his bone , and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face . Upon this , Job is put to another trial , he is sorely and sadly diseased from top to toe , v. 7. yet his heart proves sound still , v. 10.  In all this did not Job sin with his lips . And if we observe him in the whole course of his trial , though the infirmities of a man appeared in him , yet he would never be baffled out of his integrity ; and at last he comes out of the furnace like gold , Job 23.13 . And thus God often visits his people , to try their graces . I shall leave this particular ; only I shall direct you how to prove sound in all the trials which can befall you ; as thus : Make that a ground of your Religion , which no trial can ever take away : if thou wilt be Religious , because it brings thee credit or profit , etc. then if a trial comes , and God and Mammon clash , and thou must be either a Martyr or an Apostate , thy Religion is then gone and lost , because the ground and reason of it is gone : but if thou trust God , and love God , because he commands thee , and because he is a faithful and good God , here is a cause and ground and reason for thy Religion , which nothing can take away ; and so thy holiness and godliness is everlasting , because it is built and grounded upon an everlasting foundation . 

End 10.  To try his people whether they will leave this world , and come to him in the other world . Beloved , we should live in this world so , as to be always ready at an hours warning to leave all , and to go into Eternity . Now when God sends a sickness , we should look upon it as a Call into Eternity , and be ready to give a willing and obedient answer ‚ñ™ Job 14.1 , thou shalt call , that is ( saith Lavater ) call me out of this life , and I will come , I will answer thee . And thus in a Fever , or Consumption , etc.  God stands as it were by the sick bed , and calls , Come away Husband from thy Wife , come away Wife from thy Husband , come away Father from thy Children : now we should be ready to leave all , and to come home to God ; for this is one choice part of our obedience , to yield up our lives to God as his right and due , when he calls for them . Hence , saith Paul , 2 Tim. 4.6 . I am now ready to be offered . Every believer should look upon his life as a sacrifice sanctified and set apart for God , and to be always ready to be offered to him at his will and pleasure . It is observable of Moses , Deut. 32.48 , 49 ‚ñ™ 50.  God there appoints Moses to go up to Mount Nebo , and die : and did not Moses ( think ye ) go up with a heavy heart ? no , he cheerfully and obediently submits , and thither he goes up , and there he dies , Deut. 34.  So if God say to thee by his Providence , Go into a Fever and die , or go into a Dropsy and die , go upon thy sickbed and die , thou must yield , thou must go at the pleasure of God. And certainly if Believers did but clearly see whither sickness and death would bring them , it would be a thousand times harder duty to be content to live , then to be willing to die . 

End 11.  To try his people , if they will resign their friends to God when he calls for them by sickness : a friend is a choice treasure , he is alter ego , another self ; but we must obediently give up our friends to the will of God : I shall tell you what this is , thus quietly to resign our friends to God ; It is that whereby we solemnly worship God , acknowledging and praising his Name , and subjecting our hearts to his will , as he is a God of this dispensation . As for example , God smites a Husband with a disease ; now saith God by this Providence to the Wife , What if I make thee a Widow , and thy Children Fatherless ? Why ! Lord ( saith the Wife ) thou art herein a wise , holy , and good God ; and I will still own , and trust , and love , and rejoice in thee . Thus the heart must worship and praise God as he appears in this sad Providence ; and so the heart agrees with the Will of God , as it is signified by this dispensation . Now if there appear any rising of discontent , we must quiet all such tumults with the Will of God , as Eli did , 1 Sam. 3.18 . It is the Lord , let him do what seemeth good in his sight . We have an excellent pattern of this in Job , Cap. 1.20 , 21. when amongst other sad Providences , he heard of the sudden death of his sons , he fell down and worshipped God ( whom he saw in the Providence ) saying , The Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away , blessed be the Name of the Lord Thus he worshippeth and praiseth God , as it appeared , in taking away his Children . And thus when any friends are diseased , labour to get thy heart into this frame ; this will make the mercy more sweet if they live , and the affliction lesle bitter if they die . I know your thoughts will now be full of the goodness of your friends ; O such a wise , faithful , loving Husband , such a careful , meek , loving Wife ! etc. Well , look upon them at the very best , and as such offer them up to God : offer to God the best of thy flock , the best of thy friends ; the better they are , the better is thy patience and obedience in parting with them : and withal all remember , that if God will have thy friends to Eternity , there is no ransom to be taken for them , but they must be gone : thou mayst cry after them , as Elisha did by Elijah ‚ñ™ „Äà‚óä„Äâ Kings 2.12 . My Father , my Father ; but Elijah never stops to answer him : So thou mayst cry , My Husband , my Husband ; my Wife , my Wife ; my Child , my Child ! but to Eternity they will go , and never stay to answer thee ; for God taketh away , and who can hinder him ? or who can say unto him , What dost thou ? We cannot hinder him , and we must not question him , but resign all to him . 

End 12.  Christ visits his people with sickness , to fill their hearts with prayer : Solomon tells us , prov. 15.8 . The prayer of the upright is his delight . For a Believer being in Christ , and found in his Righteousness at the Throne of Grace , there ariseth such a sweet smell and savour to God , which makes the Believer and his prayers pleasant and delightful to him : and therefore God often sends sickness to stir up a spirit of prayer in the hearts of his people . Hence we read of that sick man , Job 33.26 . He shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him , and he shall see his face with joy . So when Hezekiah was sick , he turned his face to the wall ( as he lay in bed ) and wept , and prayed unto the Lord , Isa . 38.2 , 14.  So David , as appears by Psal . 30 , and 38 , and 39 when his body was full of sickness , his heart was full of prayer . See further , Psal . 107.17 , 18 , 19  

That was a savoury speech of a Reverend Divine in his sickness to his friends : Sinite me Psittaci instar cum Domino meo balbutire : Suffer me to stammer like a Parrot with my Lord by prayer . 

The hearts of God's people are called , as Mr. Brightman observes on . rev. 5.8 . Vials full of Odours ; that is , hearts full of sweet and savoury prayers . O when the bodies of the godly are as a sink full of filthy humours , their hearts are as Vials full of the precious odours of prayer . This is the blessed privilege of a Believer , that in the most sad and deplorate condition in the world , he hath always access with boldness into the presence of God , Ephes . 2.18 . Through Christ we have access by one Spirit unto the Father , Hebr. 10.19 . Having boldness to enter into the Holiest ( viz. into heaven ) by the Blood of Christ . thou mayst by faith and prayer step out of thy sick bed into heaven ‚ñ™ Job saith in his affliction , Chap. 31.37 . As a Prince would I go near unto him . Sirs , the Spirit of Prayer is a Royal Spirit , whereby a Believer goes with a Princely boldness and confidence unto God. Now indeed sickness is a most special season for prayer , because of our present need of those things which we are bound to pray for , not only in regard of our need of ease , and health , and life , though the want of these is a reason of prayer , Isa . 38.14 . I am oppressed ( with pain and trouble ) undertake for me . Hence David prays , Psalm 39.13 . OH spare me , that I may recover strength before I go hence , and be seen no more . But now our present need of soulsaving mercies should set a-work our hearts in prayer : now a man is perhaps just in his fall into Eternity , and is like to find within a few hours , whether Heaven or Hell be his portion : This man hath need to pray earnestly for sound repentance , and saving faith , and pardon of sin , and everlasting salvation . 

End 13.  To fill the hearts of the godly with sympathy to one another : as a distemper in a toe or finger , afflicts all the rest of the members ; so when one member of Christ is visited , all the members about him are called to sympathise and condole with him , 1 Cor. 12.26 . If one member suffer , all the members suffer with it . Hence we find , that when a Christian is diseased , there is a spirit of prayer poured out in his behalf from all the Christians about him . When Melancthon was sick , it 's reported , that Lutheri & Crucigeri precibus non tam convaluit , quam revixit : By the prayers of Luther and Cruciger , he was not only restored from sickness to health , but as it were from death to life . Melch. Adam . in vita Melancth . So when Myconius was sick , Luther affectionately prays , Peto ut loco tuo me faciat Dominus aegrotum : I pray that the Lord would make me sick in thy stead . Melch. Adam . in vita Mycon . David had this charity for his enemies in their sickness , Psal . 35.13 . But as for me , when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth : I humbled my soul with fasting , and my prayer returned into my own bosom . 

I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother : I bowed down heavily , as one that mourned for his Mother . Shall David thus fast and pray for his sick enemies , and shall not we for our sick friends ? Job professeth what his carriage should have been for his friends , which proved such miserable Comforters to him , Job 16.4 , 5.  If your souls were in my souls stead , I would strengthen you with my mouth , and the movings of my lips should assuage your grief . O Sirs , how sweet and savoury is it to a sick Christian , to receive spiritual Cordials from the wholesome tongue of a cordial friend ! Now this will be a reason and ground of our sympathy , if we look on Believers in their sickness , in their union and relation to Jesus Christ ; for saith Christ , Mat. 25.36 . I was sick ( viz. in my sick members ) and ye visited me . Consider , this diseased Christian is a member of that Body , whose Head sits at the right hand of the Majesty of the most High : And as poor as this sick Saint lies here , yet he is virtually raised up with Christ , and sits together with him in heavenly places : As miserable as he appears now , yet the next time we see him , we shall see him appearing with Christ in glory . Come with these considerations when you visit one another , and you will accounted it a mercy and great privilege , if you , or any thing of yours be so blessed , as to be the instrument of ease , or health , or comfort to such a precious one ; and you will find all well improved , when Christ shall say unto you , Come ye blessed of my Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you ; for I was sick , and ye visited me . 

End 14.  Christ visits his people with sickness , to glorify his power and mercy in strengthening and comforting them in their sickness : That of the Apostle is true of bodily , as well as of spiritual weakness , 2 Cor. 12.9 . My strength is made perfect in weakness . Now is a time for God to show his strength in the weakness of his people , Psal . 41.3 . The Lord will strengthen him on a bed of languishing ; thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness . Methinks that man should lie easily , who hath the God that made all the world , to make all his bed in his sickness : The meaning is , God will be the cause of rest , and ease , and peace to him in this condition . Hence Myconius in a fit of sickness writes to Luther , Se non lethaliter , sed vitaliter aegrotare ; that he is not sick unto death , but sick unto life , having so much spiritual life and comfort in his sickness : And one of Mr. Dods Converts told him in her sickness , That she was full of comfort , and could as hardly forbear singing now , as she could crying when she was in Childbearing . That of the Psalmist agrees to this , Psalm 73.26 . My flesh and my heart faileth ; but God is the strength of my heart , and my portion for ever . 

it 's observable , that God hath this title in Scripture , The God of all comfort , 2 Cor. 1.3 . because whatever comfort we have from any creature , it comes from God through the creature : it 's the goodness of God in the creature , which makes it a comfort ; it 's the goodness of God which makes a Wife a comfort , a Child a comfort , etc.  And then he is the God of all comfort , because he comforts us against all troubles : there is comfort from God through the creatures , but this is but some comfort : Money comforts a man against his debts , and meat comforts him against his hunger ; but there are other cases , as of sickness , and spiritual wounds , and temptations , etc , wherein these yield no comfort : But whatever the trouble be to a Believer , there is comfort in God against it : we have often God the Holy Ghost called in Scripture , The Comforter : now it 's a special skill to observe , which way God in a most especial manner glorifies his several Titles : This Title , The Comforter , is glorified by Gods exercising his infinite power to comfort the hearts of his distressed people : Now sickness is an affliction , wherein a man can have nothing to comfort him but God and Jesus Christ ; this is clear : for true comfort is the strengthening of the heart against the present trouble : now that which comforts us , must be as truly ours , as the trouble is ours ; we must say , Our God , and our joy , as well as Our sickness , or else we cannot have comfort . And again , it must be as near as our trouble ; for it 's no comfort to an hungry man to know he hath meat , if he cannot come at it . Now faith sees God and Christ as near to the soul to comfort it , as sickness is to the body to trouble it . And then lastly , that which comforts us , must be good enough to take away the evil that trouble's us : now a man's great trouble on his sickbed , is , for fear of losing his poor soul : and in this case , to show him riches , and honours , and pleasures , will not comfort him , for they can do nothing in the removing his trouble ; but if God say , I am thy salvation , now the man is comforted , and sings at the very door of death . Solomon tells us , prov. 14.32 . The righteous hath hope in his death . Now his hope is not for some place of preferment , or some rich purchase , or the like ; for death brings no such things ; but he hope's for preferment in the great City that hath foundations , Heb. 11.10 . where he is for ever to dwell in his house not made with hands , 2 Cor. 5.1 . and these sickness and death bring him into . That Scripture is sweet , Heb. 6.19 , 20.  Which hope we have , as an anchor of the soul , both sure and steadfast , and which entereth into that within the vail , whither our forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus . ‚Äî The place within the vail is heaven , where the anchor of hope enters and sticks : So that though a poor believer lie gasping and groaning on his sick bed , or in other afflictions ; yet this is his comfort , he is still anchored and fastened to heaven . 

End 15.  Christ visits his people with sickness , to fit them for greater sufferings : As the Martyr Bilney put his finger in the fire , to fit him to burn in the flames . Christ by sickness makes a man fit to die , and then he is fit for any sufferings ; for he that can obediently sacrifice his life to God , can for the same reason offer up his health , liberty , and estate to God : and this made Paul ready to suffer all persecutions , because he was ready to die , Acts 20.22 , 23 , 24.  He knew that every where bonds and afflictions did way-lie him ; but , saith he , v. 24.  None of these things move me : I will not stir a step out of my way of obedience , for all the bonds and afflictions that the hands of devils and men can make : What is his reason ? because I count not my life dear unto myself , so that I may finish my course with joy , and the Ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the Gospel of the grace of God. Precious Paul , so that he could die in joy , and die in duty , he did not think his life too dear or too good to be spent for Jesus Christ . So , saith he , 1 Cor. 15.32 . I protest by your rejoicing , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily . He was so acquainted with death , that he made it his daily practice to put himself into a frame and posture to die : and so many a Christian hath got such acquaintance with death by sickness , that he life's in a continual frame and readiness to die : besides , his sickness makes him lesle fearful of men : for he knows , when they have killed the body , they have no more that they can do ; they have done their worst , which is no more than an ordinary disease can do : and therefore , as the Philosopher told the Tyrant , when he threatened to kill him , that a Fly could do that : so Believers need not fear what men can do , because they can do no more than a Fever , Dropsy , Consumption , or any other disease can do : and thus he is prepared by sickness for other afflictions . 

End 16.  To prepare them for great mercy . Beloved , sometimes mercies are more dangerous for God's people than afflictions ; they are often worse in plenty then in poverty , in credit then in disgrace ; more secure in health and ease , then in pains and sickness . This happens , when our mercies are too big for our graces ; as when we have great credit , and little humility : or else when our outward mercies do most feed our inward corruptions ; as when riches do meet with a heart much inclined to covetousness , and health and ease are given to a Christian who is apt to be idle and secure : now therefore God melts his people in the Furnace of Affliction , to prepare them to be vessels of mercy . Hence we read , Hebr. 12.11 . That no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous ; nevertheless , afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby : As whilst a Child is under the discipline of the Rod , he receives the fruit of his dulness and idleness in the smarting of the Rod ; but afterwards , he receives the fruit of his learning and education in honours and preferments : So whilst God's children are corrected with sickness , and other afflictions , they receive the bitter fruit of their sins , of their pride , frowardness , security , and creature-confidence , etc. and this is not for the present joyous , but grievous ; but afterwards they reap the fruit of righteousness and holiness , of faith , fear , love , prayer , etc. and this is sweet and peaceable fruit : we have a pertinent proof of this , Psal . 126.5 , 6.  They that sow in tears , shall reap in joy . 

He that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him . As the Husbandman in a year of famine , when corn is dear , and seed scarce , he sow's , he ventures it in the ground , but he sow's in tears , he goes out with his seed weeping : Ah , thinks he , this corn would have made so much bread for my poor wife and children , or would have given so much money towards paying my rent : Thus with a sad heart he sow's his seed ; but when harvest comes , and brings forth a plentiful crop , than he reaps in joy , and brings home his sheaves with singing , shouting and rejoicing . Thus it is with God's child in affliction , as suppose in sickness , his grief is great , and his pains grievous ; yet he sow's , though it be in sorrow ; he believes in tears , and hopes in tears , and prays in tears : well , after comes the harvest of health , and he reaps the fruit of faith , hope and prayer , and he goes about rejoicing and praising God , and carrying his sheaves of mercy and comfort about with him . Our Saviour speaks fully to this case , Joh. 16.20 , 21. ‚Äî ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy . 

A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembreth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world . As a woman with child , when the hour of her travail is come , is full of sorrow with the throws and pains of her travail ; but when she is delivered , she forgets her sorrow , and with a joyful heart falls a kissing and embracing her child : So , my brethren , when the hour of sickness , or other affliction comes upon us , we are full of sorrow with the pains and travels of our affliction ; but when we are delivered , and see what mercy our affliction hath brought forth , the joy and comfort of our graces , and experiences , and deliverances , doth swallow up the sorrow of our affliction . 

We have a special instance of the glorious chain of God's wonderful Providence towards Joseph , to confirm the truth in hand : his afflictions lasted about thirteen years : ( for he was seventeen years old when he visited his brethren , Gen. 37.2 . and thirty years old , when he was preferred in Pharaohs Court , Gen. 41.46 . ) Now in all this time his afflictions were sad ; he was parted from his tender father , he was bought and sold ; after this unjustly defamed and imprisoned ; he was put like a Rogue in irons , Psal . 105.18 . his afflictions were so great , that the afflictions of God's people were long after , and ever will be to the end of the world , called the afflictions of Joseph , Amos 6.6 . yet he was after all this raised up in great mercy , and was made a blessed instrument to save the Church and Israel of God from perishing with famine . We have another instance in Job . I shall say no more of him , but only apply to his afflictions , what the Apostle saith of his patience , ye have heard of the afflictions of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; for as we read , Job 42.12 . The Lord blessed the latter end of Job . 

David upon this ground encouraged himself in his afflictions , because he believed a good issue out of them , Psal . 71.20 , 21.  thou which hast showed me great and sore troubles , shalt quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth . thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side . 

Consider further , that sickness when sanctified , exceedingly fits a man both for Spiritual and Temporal mercies ; for then a man comes out of sickness , as one who is raised from the grave , and so he is filled with the thoughts of death and eternity ; and this is a frame of heart , which gives a kindly relish to all spiritual mercies ; this makes him taste God and Christ to be exceeding gracious , in the likeness and enjoyment of whom he sees himself blessed and satisfied through all eternity : And this also fits him for Temporal mercies ; for it teacheth him to use friends , lands , food , and all his temporal enjoyments for eternity ; he hereby learns to turn his treasures in earth into treasures in heaven : This makes him at the will of God to leave father and mother , and lands , and life , knowing that he shall receive the comfort of all in another world ; so he cheerfully gives to Christ in his members , knowing that this fruit will abound to his account when Christ and he come to reckon : and that this is laid up in store as a good foundation against the time to come , 1 Tim. 6.19 . As a man that intends to transplant himself beyond the Seas , turns his stock here into such things which will make his life comfortable when he comes there : So a Saint knowing that he is upon a journey beyond this world , turns his stock and estate to God's glory here , believing that it will be returned to him a thousand fold in the glory and joys of heaven , when he comes there . 

End 17.  Which is the last that I shall mention , is to gain to himself praise and glory in recovering his people from their sickness . Hence we read , Job 11.3 , 4. when it was told Christ , that Lazarus , whom he loved , is sick : Christ answers ; This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby . Beloved , recovery from sickness is a great mercy both to a man's self and others , as St. Paul acknowledgeth of Epaphroditus , Phil. 2.27 . He was sick , nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him , and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow . And therefore upon this reason the hearts of God's people have been filled with the praises of God : Psal . 103.1 , 2 , 3.  Bless the Lord , OH my soul , and all that is within me praise his holy name : And this is one ground of this ‚Äî Who heals all thy diseases . This was Hezekiah his practice in this case ; Isa . 38.19 . The living , the living , they shall praise thee , as I do this day . ‚Äî See also , 2 Cor. 1.9 , 10 , 11.  We had the sentence of death in ourselves ; that is , our danger was so great , ( whether by sickness , or persecution , or rather both , I shall not inquire ) that we looked on ourselves as sentenced to die ; and this sentence was in us , and did fill us : but , saith he , God who raiseth the dead , delivered us from so great a death , for this end , that thanks may be given by many on our behalf . Beloved , sometimes our sicknesses are very grievous and dangerous , as Job cries out , cap. 23.2 . My stroke is heavier than my groaning ; and saith , Job 10.16 . thou showest thyself marvellous upon me ; that is , thou exercisest thy marvellous power and greatness in afflicting me . Now this should cause us to make the praises of God more glorious for our recovery ; and therefore in such cases the godly have acknowledged this mercy to be a kind of resurrection from the dead : as Psal . 30.3 . OH Lord , thou hast brought up my soul from the grave , 1 Sam. 2.6 . Who bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up . Job 33.28 , 29 , 30.  He will deliver his soul from going down into the pit , and his life shall see the light . And this is the Providence that all are to observe and acknowledge : Lo ! all these things worketh God oftentimes with man , to bring back his soul from the pit , to be enlightened with the light of the living . 

Uses . First , Use of Information , to inform us of five things . 

First Information is , that Jesus Christ is a terrible God : this appears , in that he hath all diseases at command , to bid them go , and come , and do what he william The Scripture makes known God to be a terrible God , Deut. 7.21 . He is a mighty God , and terrible , Nehem. 9.32 . The great , the mighty , and terrible God , Job 37.22 . With God is terrible Majesty , Psal . 47.2 . For the Lord most high is terrible : And we find this inference made from Gods visiting men with sickness , Deut. 28.58 . That thou mayst fear this glorious and fearful Name , The Lord thy God. Beloved , it is one of the most devouring delusions of the Devil , to persuade men , that God is so merciful , that he will never question them for their sins . Hence we read that the wicked man , who contemns God and his judgements , saith in his heart , God will not require it , Psal . 10.13 . They think in their hearts and conscience , that God will never trouble them for their sins : this secure temper of the ungodly is seen by that of the prophet , Ezek. 7.7 . The morning is come upon thee ‚Äî the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains ; or as Junius and Termellius read it , not the Echo of the mountains : implying , that they feared no more the threatenings of the Prophets , than a vain airy noise or Echo in the mountains : this makes secure sinners to bear no fear of God , Psal . 36.1 . The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart , that there is no fear of God before his eyes . Their sins are so notorious and visible , that they declare in the very hearts and consciences of the godly , that there is no fear of God before their eyes . Now to awaken you out of this damnable security , I shall propound four Considerations to convince you that God is a very terrible God.  

1.  Consider , that when the terrors of all bodily evils are passed , yet than God falls upon men with everlasting terrors : we usually accounted great men very terrible ; but God tells the wicked , Isa . 47.3 . I will take vengeance , and I will not meet thee as a man ; thou hast been afraid oftentimes of meeting with thy Creditor , or of meeting with the Magistrate , etc. but consider when thou comest to meet God in his taking vengeance for sin , he will not meet thee as a man , as a hard Creditor , or as a harsh Landlord , or a furious Soldier , or a severe Magistrate , but he will meet thee as a God of wrath and vengeance : Upon this ground our Saviour presents God terrible , Luk. 12.4 , 5.  And I say unto you , My friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do . But I will forewarn you whom you should fear ; fear him , which after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , fear him . Observe , that what our Saviour saith of men , is true of all bodily evils , when they have killed the body , they have no more that they can do ; then the fear of them is passed ; there is no fear of Pestilence , or Fever , or Consumptions in eternity : but now a wicked man can never say the worst is past , because he can never be past hell : for God after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell ; so that when you think it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a merciless Usurer , or a cruel Landlord , or a bloody man ; or to fall into the fire , or water ; or to fall into the Pestilence , Fever , Dropsy , etc. then consider that , It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  

Secondly , consider , God is not only a God of mercy , but also a God of judgement : the Devil devours most men by persuading them , either that God hath no wrath , which makes them presumptuous ; or that he hath no mercy , which makes them desperate . Now to arm you against the former temptation , which concerns the business in hand , fill your hearts with the belief of God , as he is a God of judgement , for the Lord is known by the judgement which he executeth , Psal . 9.16 . therefore he tells us : I kill , and I make alive , Deut. 32.39 . So saith he , Isa . 45.7 . I form the light , and create darkness ; I make peace , and create evil : I the Lord do all these things : All the evil of punishment which comes into the world , comes from God ; all the hurt that is done by fire , water , wind , thunder , earthquakes , God doth it ; all the hurt that comes by famine , pestilence , sword , blasting , mildew , God doth it ; all that die , God kills them ; all that go to hell , God damns them : and is not this a terrible God ? 

Thirdly , look not on God as men judge of him , when they are secure , and God is patient ; but as he appears , when men awake with guilt , and God awakes in wrath . Beloved , if every Sin should presently bring a Judgement , if every Oath should kill a Cow , and every Lie break a Bone , and every act of Drunkenness turn a man into a Dropsy ; then sin would be accounted more dangerous , and God more terrible : But as we read , Psal . 55.19 . Because they have no changes , therefore they fear not God. When men can swear , lie , be drunk , scoff at godliness , profane Sabbaths , and yet eat , drink , sleep , work , and play all alike ; this makes them confident , that God is not so angry with them , as a company of precise Puritan would have them believe . We read of this Atheistical temper , Psal . 50.21 , 22.  These things hast thou done ( meaning the crying sins forementioned ) and I kept silence ( saith God ) I did not disturb thee , nor hinder thee ; and thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself , that I liked sin as well as thou didst ; but thou wilt be of another mind , when I come to reprove thee , and to set thy sins in order before thee , and to tear thee in pieces , when there shall be none to deliver thee . We read , Psal . 40.11 . Evil shall hunt the violent man to destroy him ; and it is said , Numb . 32.23 . Your sin shall find you out . Sinners lie close and hide themselves in their sins , as if judgement could never find them : O , but consider , sicknesses , and death , and hell are looking for thee , they are hunting after thee . Hark , methinks I hear the cry of the hunters , and the sound of the feet of death pursuing thy soul : I may say unto thee as she said to Samson , The Philistines are upon thee Samson : Sickness is upon thee sinner ; death and judgement is coming upon thee ; the wrath of the eternal God is roaring against thee : these things should make thee cry out with David , Psal . 119.20 . My flesh trembleth for fear of thee , and I am afraid of thy judgements . 

Lastly , Consider God as a God of all sicknesses and diseases , to convince thee that he is a terrible God ; these with other judgements are called the terrors of God , Job 6.4 . The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me ; and it 's clear that God for this reason is terrible ; for that is terrible which is destructive to the health , and life , and being of man ; this makes fire , water , wind , thunder , men and devils terrible ; and this makes Sickness , the Pestilence , Fever , the Pocks , the Stone , the Consumption , and Death , and Judgement terrible . Now therefore what a terrible Majesty is God , who makes all these so terrible ? for as there is no fear of an Ox-goad , or of the Jawbone of an Ass ; but the one in the hand of a mighty Shamgar , was a terrible instrument of death to six hundred men , Judges 3.31 . and the other in the hand of a strong Samson killed heaps upon heaps , heaps upon heaps , a thousand men , Judges 15.16 . So this makes all diseases , and all instruments of death terrible , because they are in the hand of a mighty God , who for this reason is to be acknowledged and feared as a very terrible God.  

Secondly , informs us of the infinite patience of God towards ungodly men ; which appears , in that God hath all diseases , and death at command to avenge himself upon them , and yet that he is pleased so long to forbear . The Scripture makes known the glory of God to us by this Attribute , Exod. 34.6 . The Lord merciful and gracious , long-suffering . So Psal . 86.14 . Rom. 2.4 . This patience of God is his infinite goodness , whereby he doth moderate and with - hold his wrath from falling upon sinners . Pardoning grace takes a way the wrath of God , and loses the believer from being bound to suffer it : But here the sinner lies condemned , and stands bound over by the Law , to suffer God's wrath ; but God by his infinite patience forbears to inflict it . 

Now I shall briefly propound these three Considerations , to convince us of the patience of God.  

1.  Consider the greatness of that wrath which God withholds from falling on you , viz. all the punishments which are threatened in the curses of God's Law : God doth not only keep off million of diseases , but also mountains of torments from coming upon thee every day : the great difference which is betwixt thee and a damned soul in hell , is made by the patience of God. O poor Christless sinner , when I stand seriously looking on thee eating , and drinking , and laughing , and sporting in thy sins , as if thou thoughtest thyself as safe as ever an Angel of heaven ; and then believe what the Scripture speaks against thee , and see what is in God against thee ; I cannot but tremble to look thee in the face , to see whither thou art so merrily going , and what an alteration sickness and death is shortly like to make with thee , but for present God in infinite patience withholds all the wrath that thou deservest . 

2.  Consider the great provocations that God doth bear : Sin is said to provoke or call forth the wrath of God ; and notwithstanding such horrid sins call and cry for his wrath , yet in the infinite power of his patience he forbears . The Scripture ascribes a Voice to three things which cry aloud for God's wrath . 

1.  Sin cries , Gen. 18.20 , 21.  The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is great . ‚Äî Swearing cries , Pour out thy wrath on the Blasphemer , that belcheth out me : Drunkenness cries , O thou consuming fire , devour this Beast that commits me . So there is a cry against a Nation , and against a City or Family : O Profaneness cries , Come away Pestilence , come away Famine , and devour England , that is so filled with me : but yet God in infinite patience withholds his Judgements . 

2.  The Estates of men which are gained by sin and wickedness cry for vengeance , James 5.4 . Hab. 2.11 . The stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it . The Prophet speaks , as if all the parts of a house built by fraud and blood , did consent to cry one after another for vengeance against the founders of it : the Stone cries , Lord revenge the cruelty and injustice that laid me ; and the Timber answers and cries , Make inquisition for the blood that laid me . O you that eat the bread of deceit , and live upon lies and injustice , were your consciences awakened , you might hear the very bread on your tables , and the money in your purses , and the stones and timber of your houses cry for the vengeance of God against you ; and yet this infinitely patient God bears with you . 

Lastly , the sighs and groans of God's people cry aloud for vengeance against their Persecutors and Oppressors . Exod. 3.7 . I have seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt , and have heard their cry : Psal . 12.4 . For the oppression of the poor , and the sighing of the needy , will I arise . Beloved , the godly are hated for their likeness to God : this makes the difference betwixt them and the wicked ; for herein they differ from the world ; and a man must either make God his enemy , and the Devil his father , and be content to damn his own soul , or else the world and he will never be friends , but he that is born after the flesh will persecute him that is born after the spirit . Now herein is glorified the patience of God , when they that wrong his people , rake in the apple of his eye ; and yet this tender Father stands by , and sees his children scorned , and loathed , and murdered , for choosing , and honouring , and fearing , and pleasing him , and for a long time bears all . 

Lastly , the infinite patience of God appears , in that he can always ease himself of his enemies , and yet he forbears . God complains , that the sins of men are a trouble to him , Isa . 1.14 . and that they weary him , Isa . 43.24 . and , saith he , Amos 2.13 . Behold , I am pressed under you , as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaves . Now the Scripture speaks , as if God did ease and comfort himself in the destruction of his enemies , Isa . 1.24 . Ah , I will ease me of my adversaries ‚Äî Ezek. 5.13 . I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted . Now God can suddenly thus ease and comfort himself : let him but command the Pestilence , the Fever , the Pocks , etc. they will quickly fetch them to hell , never to trouble him more ; but in his infinite patience , and long-suffering , he spares them , and bears with them . 

Thirdly , Informs us of the reason why godly Ministers are so serious in showing men their danger , and pressing them to repentance , because they see Almighty God armed with such a multitude of diseases , and judgements , and deaths against men : when a Minister is filled with love to , and longing for the salvation of his people , and sees the diseases , and other judgements , which lie at the door of every sinner ; and knows , that the want of his care and faithfulness may be the damnation of a soul , or more , before another opportunity ; this must needs make Ministers labour earnestly for the salvation of their people : and therefore it is an excellent thing for a Minister to preach , and pray , and administer Sacraments , and live , as if he saw God , and Christ , and Angels , and Devils , and Death , and Judgement looking him in the face ; to preach as if he were to die preaching , and people were to die under his Sermons . Hence , saith the Apostle , 2 Cor. 5.10 . We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ : whence he infers , vers . 11.  Knowing therefore the terrors of the Lord , we persuade men . Beloved , we know what Christ will do to us , if we preach the word deceitfully , and damn the souls whom we are sent to save . We know the doom of those who know not God , and obey not the Gospel , 2 These . 1.8 , 9  We know whither drunkards , and whoremongers , and blasphemers , and worldlings , and all unregenerate persons are going ; and therefore knowing the terrors of the Lord , we persuade men : we are sent in the stead of Christ to persuade you to heaven , and therefore dare not stand in the stead of Devils to flatter you into hell . Sirs , it is not many weeks since I was even past preaching , and I know that death and I must shortly meet again , and I know ere long you will be past hearing ; and therefore I would preach and live so , that when sickness and death return , I may be found labouring to save myself , and them that hear me . In the mean time , when I look upon God , and see million of deaths in his hands , and every death hell following it ; I dare not but warn you to flee from the wrath to come , Mat. 3.7 . Beloved , a faithful Minister would never tell you of your sins , but to cause you to forsake them ; and the word Hell should not be so often in his Pulpit , but that he is afraid lest his people should come there : he hath no secret grudge against you , neither desire's the woeful day , God knows , Jer. 17.16 . but he dares not deceive you , he dares not be damned for you , in preaching you and himself into hell . 

The fourth informs us , whence it is that we hear so much of the unexpected deaths of men ; why here is the cause , God commands a disease , or some other messenger of death , to go and to fetch them away , and they are gone : if any die , God tells all the world who kills them ; I kill , saith he , Deut. 32.39 . Hence we see great men for a while fill a Country ; and a frown of their faces , and a stamp of their foot , makes all to quake about them : but they prove like Pharaoh , of whom we read , Jer. 46.17 . Pharaoh King of Egypt is but a noise . So they make a great noise in the Country a while , and then like a sound in the Air pass away . Methinks a great man is like a great wind , it blows violently , and rageth a while , as if it would throw down all afore it ; but it proves but a wind which is soon spent and laid . So a furious wicked man , he blusters and ruffles a while , as if he would blow down God and man ; but a disease , and death comes , and he gives up the ghost , and where is he ? David made this observation , Psal . 37.35 , 36.  I have seen the wicked in great power , and spreading himself like a green Bay-tree . Observe , he spreads himself , he enlargeth his power , and riches , and greatness : But see what follows , Yet he passed away , and lo , he was not ; yea , I sought him , but he could not be found : for a sickness comes , and like a tempest takes him away in a night , Job 27.20 . and so by the blast of God they perish , Job 4.9 . So we see others which would be as great sinners , but that they are not so great men ; for instrumenta explicandae nequitiae desunt , as Seneca speaks , they want instruments to do mischief : these cursed kine have short horns , and so cannot do so much hurt : these men are full of lies , oaths , drunkenness , and are set on fire against God and godliness , sinning with that impudence , as if they would outface and browbeat God and man , and make death and hell afraid of them ; but a sickness and death comes , and they are driven away in their wickedness , prov. 14.32 . whose end Job describes , cap. 24.29 . Drought and heat consume the snow-waters , so doth the grave those that have sinned . 

So also we see godly people , who are the blessing of their Age , of whom the world is not worthy , Hebr. 11.38 . the world deserves not the prayers , and counsels , and examples of such men ; yet these perish , though few lay it to heart , Isa . 57.1 . ( for in this case there is one event to all , Eccles . 9.2 . for as they lie at the graves mouth , we cannot see the difference betwixt a skull that sleeps in Jesus , and a skull that is condemned to hell ) and therefore it 's true of these gracious ones , as was said of the good Patriarch , Gen. 47.29 . Israel must die ; or as we read of David , Acts 13.36 . After he had served his own generation , by the will of God , he fell asleep . All these things are from Jesus Christ , who sends sicknesses and death at his pleasure ; and many such things are with him . 

Lastly , It informs us of the great mercy of God , that we enjoy our health and lives so long , when he hath so many diseases in his hands to deprive us of both : Hence he is called , the Preserver of men , Job 7.20 . It is the Lord who is our life , and the length of our days ; who preserves us , and keeps us alive . 

Consider the many deaths and dangers we are preserved from , that thereby we may see and acknowledge the greatness of this mercy . Our Bodies and Souls were no sooner united in the Womb , but thousands of deaths were ready to part us again : we were liable to all the dangers that our Mothers were in , in whose lives our lives were bound up ; besides , multitudes of evils might have killed us there , and a miscarrying Womb might have loosed us into Eternity . And if we look through the whole course of our Age , what year , or week , or day can we name , wherein some have not died ? O infinite mercy , that keeps us alive in a world of devouring devils and bloody men ! what multitudes of diseases might have bred in our own bodies ! what sudden deaths by Falls , Fire , Water , Thunderbolts , etc.  There is never a beam in our houses , or beast in our fields , or bit of meat on our tables , or stones in the streets , but methinks it 's like a Pistol charged and cocked ( if God say the word ) to strike us dead in the place : where ever we sit , ride , walk , lie down , there is from thence a fall into Eternity . We may well wonder , when we read of the three children's preservation in the Fiery Furnace , Dan. 3. and of Daniels safety in the Lion's Den , Dan. 6. and yet I tell you , our daily and hourly deliverances are as great , only they are not so rare : for to name no more , Devils can as easily kill us , as the Fire or Lions could them ; and we have no more power to resist or escape these Murderers , than they had the merciless Flames , or greedy Lions ; but as God miraculously preserved them , so doth he wonderfully preserve us , even in a crowd of deaths and dangers . 

Use 2.  Of Reprehension . Secondly , This Doctrine reproves those who in time of sickness do either for themselves , or friends , seek to Witches or Wizards for cure ; Christ makes them sick , and they will go to the Devil to make them well : but if Christ command all diseases to go and come at his will , it must needs be a damnable sin to forsake Christ , and the Ordinances appointed by him for our health , and to seek help from the Devil . This was King Saul's sin , though in another case , who consulted the Witch of Endor , when he was invaded by the Philistines , 1 Sam. 28.7 . then did Ahaziah in his sickness send to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron , 2 Kings 1.2 . And this is the horrid wickedness of many ignorant Atheistical wretches , who when they have lost their goods , or are visited with sickness , seek to Conjurers and Wizards , such as they call wise men , or wise women , to help and relieve them : This sin is often condemned in Scripture , Leu. 19.31 . Regard not them that have familiar spirits . Observe , do not regard them , but look upon them as the basest people in the Country , neither seek after Wizards . See Isa . 8.19 . Leu. 26.6 . 

Observe the evil and danger of this sin , in these four particulars . 

First , This is a sin which brings a man under the heavy wrath and curse of God , Leu. 20.6 . The soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people . Observe , for this sin God will set his face against thee , all his power and wrath is set and bend against thee : OH how canst thou hold up thy face , when the face of God is set against thee ! and whereas thou thinkest thou art planted in thy Country , and planted in the Church of God , and planted in thy Family , God will cut thee off from among thy people . Thus , poor wretch , thy disease is perhaps abated , and thou rejoicest in thy ease and health ; but remember , thou hast got the Devil's blessing , and God's curse . 

Secondly , This is that filthy sin of whoredom . See again , Leu. 20.6 . The soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits ‚Äî to go a whoring after them . Do not you accounted this a beastly sin , for people to go up and down a whoring ? Well , though thou thinkest thou keepest thyself honest , and wilt say , I thank God no body can touch me in my honesty ; yet although all thy Neighbours judge thee to be honest , the Lord judgeth thee to be a filthy Whore , and Whoremonger : for though perhaps thou hast not defiled thy body with a Whore , yet thou hast defiled thy soul with the Devil , Leu. 19.31 . Regard not them that have familiar spirits ‚Äî to be defiled by them ; and thou mayst be assured , that the Devil will not heal thy body , except it be to kill thy soul ; and thou dost hereby join that person to the Devil , which should be united to Christ ; thou dost yield thyself to the power and will of the Devil : Hence those are the most ignorant , sottish , profane , or covetous people , that seek to Witches . Beloved , we should do nothing , but what we may comfortably go from the doing of it into the presence of God in any duty , or to enjoy his presence into Eternity : Now , as a wife can have no delight to go from a whoremonger , into the presence or society of her husband ; so how canst thou comfortably go from a Wizard to Prayer , to a Sacrament , or to a Sermon , or from a Wizard into Eternity ? 

Thirdly , This sin is the most abominable sin of Idolatry , Leu. 11.31 . Regard not ‚óèhem that have familiar spirits ‚Äî I am the Lord your God : Implying , that they that seek to such , do deny God to be the Lord , and do disown him from being their God , and make the Devil and his Instruments their God. Idolatry is that sin whereby men forsake the true God , and set up any thing in the place of God ; and this sin is so much the worse , by how much that is more vile , and more unlike God , and more against him , which thou makest an Idol of ; and therefore this is the worst kind of Idolatry : for what is more vile , and more unlike God , and more against him , than an ugly damned Devil ? yet by seeking to Wizards in thy distress , thou dost in effect deny the power , and goodness , and mercy of God , and accountest the Devil more able , and more merciful , and more willing to do thee good than God himself . 

Lastly , This sin is an horrible violation of our Covenant with God , which we entered in by Baptism ; for thereby we are bound to be for God , and Christ , and the Church , and Salvation , against the Devil and all his party : Now hereby thou goest against God , and ownest the Devil to be thy friend to heal thee . The Prophet pleads this argument against this sin , Isa . 8.19 . When they shall say unto you , Seek unto them that have familiar spirits , and unto Wizards , that peep and mutter ( do not be tempted thereunto ) should not a people seek unto their God , the God in Covenant with them , but to the Devils and their Confederates , whom they have covenanted against ? We have the same argument pleaded , 2 Kings 2.3 , 4. where we find that Elijah meets Ahaziah his messengers as they were going to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ; and he tells them in effect , You may spare your labour , for Ahaziah shall die . But mark how he expostulates with them , verse . 3.  Is it not because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron ? So Sirs , Is there not a God in England ? And are there not means of his appointment ? and are there not Ministers and Christians to pray for you , who are in league with him , but must you seek to such who are in league with the Devil ? Beloved , do not you look upon yourselves as parts and members of Jesus Christ ? and will you bring a member of Christ to be healed by the Devil ? What , hath the Devil more care of Christ's members , than Christ himself ? or hath Christ need of the Devil to help or heal ever a member of his ? I tell you , Christ would not himself , and he abhors that ever a member of his should fall down , or worship , or stoop to the Devil . 

Now to excuse this horrid sin , people ordinarily make such Objections as these . 

Object . 1.  My loving neighbours and friends gave me counsel to send to the wise woman for the health of my child , etc.  

Answ . 1.  It is a device of Satan , when he tempts to sin , to make as many as he can partakers of it ‚ñ™ and therefore in this case he may tempt one to give this devilish counsel , and thereby he signifieth he is willing of it , and so becomes guilty both of the sin itself , and of being a Devil to his neighbour , by tempting him to the same sin : another is tempted to take the counsel , and so both consents unto , and also commits the sin ; another applauds it ; another is hired to go to the Witch ; the Witch herself is hardened in her sin : and thus the sin goes through many hands , and spreads over many persons ; so that often in this case , many in the neighbourhood , and the whole family where the person is visited , and many more are fearfully brought into the same condemnation . 

2.  Consider what persons they are who advice thee : Did ever any godly Minister or Christian give thee such counsel ? Did ever these loving friends and neighbours ( as thou callest them ) seriously tell thee of thy danger by sin , and exhort thee to become a new ereature , and to set up the worship of God ‚ñ™ in thy family , and to labour for the salvation of thy precious soul ? I tell thee , thou mayest go to hell with the love of such as thou callest loving neighbours , but that will not ease thy torments when thou comest there . 

Lastly , Let thy Counsellors be who they will , the Word of God hath plainly prevented this objection , Isa . 8.19 . When they shall say unto you , ( when they shall give you this damnable counsel ) Seek unto them that have familiar spirits , do not be tempted by them ; for should not a people seek unto their God ? 

2 Object . Many in the like case seek to the wiseman , or wise-woman , as well as I ; they come far and near to them for help . 

Answ . It is most certain , as long as such ignorant , unbelieving , covetous Atheists as thou art , live in the world , the Devil shall never want Customers ; and if thou wilt follow a multitude to sin , thou wilt find when thou comest to hell , and standest at the left hand of Christ at the day of Judgement , that thou art never like to want such company . 

3 Object . I know not that such to whom I seek for help , are in league with the Devil ; I am sure they speak godly words of God and Christ , and they do no hurt ; and therefore for aught I know , they are as godly people as any are in the Country . 

I shall answer this Objection in these four particulars . 

1.  A Wizards using the Name of God , and Christ , or some Scriptures , excuseth not his being in league with the Devil ; they that know not this , are grossly ignorant both of the wisdom and will of God , and also of the depths and devices of the Devil ; for the Devil doth most despite and blaspheme God , when he conceals his own name , and forgeth the name of God to the most horrid wickedness : and therefore let not the cursed wretches deceive you with the name of God , and so bring you into communion with , and into the condemnation of the Devil ; but follow the directions of the Word of God , which is purposely given to undeceive those that are apt to be a prey to these delusions , Isa . 8.19 , 20. ‚Äî To the law , and to the testimony ; if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them . 

2.  Judge no better of them , because thou thinkest them so harmless : thou thinkest its pity but such a Hag were burned , who bewitcheth people's bodies , children , cattles , etc. but thou sayest these do no hurt , but much good , in telling to stolen goods , in healing the sick , and curing diseased cattles , or the like . But beloved , this is but a pretence for the Devil ; for his greatest wiles are to bring you to be tormented with him in hell : and therefore he is content you should be healthful , and wealth , and merry , ( for as we say , the Devil is kind to his own ) so that he can tempt you to be sinful : Hence it is , that he will entice you to seek to him for the healing your bodies , because it serves his design to kill your souls : Besides , there is a confederacy among the Devils , so that one Witch by her league with the Devil , may bewitch you into sickness ; another , by as bad a league , will ( as it is termed ) bless you into health ; but though these seem to counter-work one another , yet the Devils in both agree to devour your souls . 

3.  It is enough to deter thee from ever seeking to such , when they are branded with the names of Witches , Wizards , Conjurers , etc.  When they are so reputed , not only by some malicious slanderers ( for Christ himself was slandered as one who had commerce with the Devil , Matth. 12.24 . ) but also by the voice of the country , and by the sober , wise , charitable and godly Ministers and people , who hear of their Clients , and of their practice . 

Lastly , this is a sufficient reason for all to abhor the thoughts of seeking to them , because they use such means , upon the use of which thou hast no Scripture-ground to believe , or call upon God for a blessing ; as when they use enchanting words , spells , circles , herbs , salt , stones , etc. which have no natural virtue to work such effects : for these are but signs upon the use of which the Devil hath bound himself to his confederates , to do what they trust him for : For as Peter Martyr well observes , the Devil is herein God's Ape to imitate him ; and therefore as God hath made a covenant of grace with his people , and hath ordained Sacramental signs and seals , upon the faithful use of which he is present to believers , to perform all that he hath promised in the Covenant . So the Devil makes a covenant with Witches , and appoints them to use certain signs and tokens , upon the use of which he is present to do ( so far as he can , and God permits ) all that they call upon him , and trust to him for : And thus you may see the nature , evil and danger of this horrid wickedness of seeking in your sicknesses to Witches and Wizards for health ; that such as are guilty may repent and pray to God , that the thoughts of their hearts may be forgiven them : and that others who may be tempted to this sin , may hear , and fear , and do no more any such wickedness . 

Secondly , This Doctrine reproves those who are full of murmuring and discontent , when Christ visits them or their friends with sickness : If Christ commands diseases to go , there can be no reason to murmur ; if Christ doth it , no body must find fault : yet most people are very apt to this sin in time of sickness ; for this is the property of a man , that what ever is most in his heart , when he is troubled , it presently riseth , and works up into his affections , thoughts , looks , words and actions . I shall illustrate this by a clear similitude : Take two bottles of wine , the one with sugar , the other with dregss at the bottom ; now shake them , and the sugar and dregss will rise and work up , and the one fills the wine with a sweet and pleasant taste , and the other will make it muddy and unpleasant both to taste and look upon : so if a godly man and ungodly man be visited with sickness , when the godly man is stirred and troubled , his graces will presently work , and the man will be full of faith , love , patience and prayer , which makes his words and carriage exceeding sweet and savoury ; but when the wicked man is visited , the dregss of sin presently rise and work up ‚ñ™ and his words and actions are then full of pride , anger and discontent , which make him sinful and unsavoury : so that I say a murmuring and discontented spirit usually prevails with men in sickness , or other afflictions . The Jews are often branded for this sin , which was so notorious in them , that the Scripture warns all people to take heed of murmuring for their sake , 1 Cor. 10.10 . Neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer . Now to arm you against this sin , I shall briefly 1.  Show you the Nature and Properties of it ; 2.  The Causes , 3.  The sad Consequences of it . 

For the first , observe the nature of it in this description : The sin of murmuring is an unruly , disobedient , and unquiet frame of spirit , whereby the heart riseth against God , so as to question and quarrel with him , as if he were unholy , cruel , unjust , and unmerciful in his proceedings against us . 

As by the grace of contentation the heart doth quietly and obediently yield to the Will of God , so as to approve and praise all his dealings as holy , just and fatherly to him ; so a discontented spirit doth resist God , and judge of all his dispensations , as if they were unworthy and injurious to him . This sin is further known by these four filthy properties . 

1.  It is a rebellious rising of the heart against God , especially as he appears in that Providence which is the present occasion of his murmuring . Hence murmurers are called rebels , Numb . 16.41 . for now all the powers of a man are up in a tumult and insurrection against God ; the affections and thoughts rise up in a quarrel with him . O what a fearful case is this , that when a man's body is so weak that he cannot rise out of bed , yet his corruptions are so strong , that they rise in an uproar against the Will , and Authority , and Justice of God  

2.  It is an unjust judging of God : for whatever the murmurer pretends , his quarrel is against God , as the cause of his visitation : Perhaps in thy sickness , thy discontented spirit fly's out towards thy husband , wife , children , or servants which are about thee : but they may say with Moses to the Israelites , Exod. 16.8 . What are we ? ( did we make thee sick ? are we the causes of thy aches and pains ? ) thy murmurings are not against us , but against the Lord : Nay , sometimes the spirit riseth so high , that it expressly complains of God , as if the parties grieved would set themselves above him , and call him to their bar , and be the judges of God and his dispensations : so did the Israelites , Numb . 14.3 . wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land ? ‚Äî O horrid pride and insolency ! they challenge God as if he had wronged and deceived them in bringing them from Egypt : Such men practise what Jobs wife tempted him unto in his sickness , Job 2.9 . Curse God and die ; they have cursed and blasphemous thoughts of God and his Providence ‚ñ™ it appears that men do thus judge God , Psal . 51.4 . That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest , and be clear when tho‚óè judgest ; implying , that God is judged and condemned by wicked men ; and therefore he is said to justify and clear himself : O thou proud worm , thou conceited clay , judge thyself , and not God ; for he giveth not account of any of his matters ; and to be sure he will overcome when he is judged . 

3.  A murmuring spirit makes his mercie‚óè little , and his afflictions great . This cursed property is seen in the Israelites ; for although their deliverance from Egypt was such a Providence as God delights to be owned by : Hence he is so often called , The God that brought them out of the land of Egypt ; and God chooseth this as a fit preface to the Ten Commandments , as if it were a sufficient reason to all to worship and obey him , Exod. 20.2 . I am the Lord thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , etc. yet how often did the discontented Jews upbraid God with that mercy ? Would to God we had died in the land of Egypt ! wherefore hast thou brought us out of the land of Egypt ? Thus many in sickness and pain forget the mercy of God in all the days of their health and life : in a few hours sickness , they forget a whole age of rich mercy . 

Lastly , discontent frets and disquiets a man's self , Psal . 37.1 . and therefore it hurts them more than the affliction ; as if man have a cut , or wound in his flesh , this will disease and trouble him : but if a fretting humour fall in the wound to vex and inflame it , this is far more hurtful and dangerous than the wound itself : so thy sickness must needs trouble thee ; but if under thy visitation thy heart abound with proud and peevish humours , which makes thee fret against God ; this makes thy condition far more miserable than the disease itself would make it . 

Secondly , observe four Causes of Discontent . 

1.  Ignorance of God's dominion over his creatures : this is clear by the parable of the labourers in the Vineyard , Matth. 20. where our Saviour doth silence the labourers murmuring about their wages with this , Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? vers . 15. implying , that if they had known and considered that it was his own , they would have found no cause to quarrel : So many murmur in their sickness , to see worse sinners have their ease and health ; but they do not consider that their life , health , and bodies , are Gods own , and all diseases are his own , and he sends them to whom he will ; and though others have more mercy , yet they have no wrong : do not you put your Oxen to labour , and after that to the slaughter ? yet if any question you for using the poor cattles so cruelly , you will not stick to tell them , Friend's , we hurt nothing of yours , may we not do what we will with our own ‚ñ™ Sirs , God hath a greater right over you , than you have over your cattles ; if he disease you , and destroy you , he hurts nothing of yours ; and therefore he may do what he will with his own . 

2.  Discontent ariseth from men's expectation of settlement in the world ; for certainly they that trust to vanity , shall be filled with vexation of spirit ; for disappointment always breeds discontent : as the Husbandman that dungs , and ploughs , and sow's his ground , if his expectation of a crop be too great , and he doth not consider how many thousand dangers may come between the Plough and the Sickle , but reckon aforehand of so many measures for his family , and so many to pay rend , and so many for seed : now if the crop fail at harvest , here is a sad repining and discontent : so if a man's expectation of the world is too high , and having heaped up riches , he begins to bless himself , saying , I have so much for a purchase , and so much for portions for my children ; now if when he is just catching at them to use them , they take themselves wings and fly away ; no marvel if they leave the owner murmuring at the Providence . When the Israelites were so miraculously saved from Egypt , they thought that deliverance had put a period to all their troubles ; and therefore every cross being a disappointment , sets them on murmuring : so they that promise themselves health , and ease , and plenty in the world , when sickness and want comes , they presently fret and complain ; whereas they that look and prepare for changes , live in a more composed and quiet frame ; if mercy comes , they are thankful ; and if affliction comes , they are content . 

The third Cause of discontent is Unbelief . Hence the Israeliles murmur , because they believed not the good report which Joshua and Caleb gave of the land of Canaan , Numb . 14.11 . How long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them ? Sirs , an unbelieving heart is always a discontented heart ; for an unbeliever hath nothing to still and quiet the heart with , in his afflictions : observe , every cross takes away something which did feed and please the heart , as health , riches , credit , pleasures and friends , etc. now when these are lost , a man doth , as it were , feel something go out of his heart ; but then faith fills , and still's the heart , by bringing into it God , and Christ , and heaven : Why art thou disquieted , OH my soul ! trust still in God , Psal . 43.5 . but now God , and Christ , and the promises , and heaven , are nothing to an unbeliever , and so yield him no peace and comfort ; therefore he must needs be like the troubled sea , when the storms and winds of affliction blow upon him , and he hath nothing to calm and comfort his soul . 

Lastly , discontent ariseth from men's being so very sensible of the evil of affliction , and senseless of the evil of sin . men's bodies are tender , and their senses quick , and therefore even the biting of a flea , the scratching of a Pin is presently felt : and men are so tender of their reputation , profits and delights , that the least touch in these is a cross to them : but their hearts are so hard , and consciences feared , that they can lie securely under all the curses of God's book , and have mountains of wrath abide on them , and feel nothing ; and therefore afflictions lie so heavy , because sin lies so easy : Whereas , if a man knew what sin is , and saw at night what wrath he had treasured up all the day , he would rather wonder , that he were out of hell , then murmur that he were in trouble : this did silence the Church , when she remembered the wormwood and the gall ; because she knew that it was of the Lords mercies , that she was not consumed : therefore she pleads , Lam. 3.39 . wherefore doth a living man complain ! A man that deserves death and hell , cannot reasonably complain if he be alive ; as it is unreasonable for a Thief that deserves to be hanged , to complain because he is whipped : And then it is added , a man for the punishment of his sin : Why should a man complain of that which he hath brought upon himself ? Solomon speaks of this as very unequal , prov. 19.3 . The foolishness of a man perverteth his way ; that is , man's sin brings him into trouble , and his heart fretteth against the Lord Man is in all the fault , and he would have God to bear all the blame . 

In the next place , observe four sad consequences of this Sin.  

First , murmuring debaseth a man , by turning him into the likeness of the basest creature : we have a remarkable Scripture for this , in Psal . 59 in the sixth verse ; David saith of his enemies , They return at evening , they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the City ; that is , they go about like the Devils beagles , hunting God's people : Well , saith David , vers . 14. seeing they love the sport so well , At evening let them return , and make a noise like a dog , and go round about the City ; that is , let thy judgements so afflict them , that they may like hungry and angry Curs go crying and yelling about the City : so that here the murmuring of a man in trouble , is compared to the yelling of a dog ; so this sin is compared to the roaring of Bears , Isa . 59.11 . We roar all like bears : and Zanchy observes , that the word „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ translated murmurers , Phil. ‚óè . 14 . signifies a noise like the grunting of a swine : nay , this sin makes a man like the very Devil , who is a most restless and discontented spirit , and therefore is said , Matth. 12.43 . To walk about seeking rest , and finding none . And it is true of many on their sick-beds , which we read , Hos . 7.14 . They have not cried unto me , when they have howled ( viz. like beasts ) upon their beds . Now what a fearful case is this , that when in thy sickness thou shouldst have been full of the thoughts , and language , and savour of a Christian , so as to be praying unto , and praising and pleasing God , and saving , and edifying others , and quieting and solacing thy own soul , that thou shouldst by murmuring and discontent , be yelling like a Dog , roaring like a Bear , howling like a Beast , grunting like a Swine , and be like a restless and desperate Devil ! 

Secondly , discontent unfits the soul for every duty : you cannot endure to see your children go grumbling to meat , and grumbling to School , and grumbling to bed , and grumbling to ask you blessing : so it greatly provokes God to see people go murmuring to prayer , and murmuring to Sermons , and murmuring to Sacraments . Beloved , lay this up as a rule , and let it always reign in your hearts , viz. That a man can never go holily and comfortably to any duty , except his heart be reconciled to these three things ; To God , to all men , and to all God's Providences : Therefore when a man is quarrelling with God and men , and murmuring at all Gods dealings ; always either complaining that his mercies are too little , or his afflictions too great : how miserably unfit is such a man to look God in the face in any duty ! 

Thirdly , murmurers are always miserable , according to our Proverb , An angry person never wants woe ; as if a man that hath his body full of sores , come in a crowd where he is always jogged and thrust , this must needs hurt and vex his sores . Beloved , a discontented spirit is a sore spirit , and the least touch of affliction doth vex it : and therefore for such a man to live always in a crowd of miseries , wherewith he is continually hurt and vexed , this must needs be a miserable man It is observable , that God himself is set to cross such a man , Leu. 26.27 , 28.  If ye walk contrary to me , I will walk contrary to you : As thus , God would have you to believe , love , fear , and please him : Now you walk contrary to God , you deny , hate , despise and provoke him : Well , you would have God to bless , preserve , pardon and save you : O but God will walk contrary to you , he will curse , destroy , and damn you : Now they cannot but be in an unquiet condition , who have God himself always crossing and thwarting them . See Psal . 18.26 . With the froward thou wilt show thyself froward : If you will be cross with God , he will be cross with you : and therefore observe when you are discontented , something falls out from Wife , Children , Servants or Neighbours , to exasperate and fret you more : so that I say this sin makes a man spend his days in bitterness and sorrow . 

Lastly , murmurers shall be judged at the last day as ungodly men , Judas v. 14 , 15 , 16. where we see , that when the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints , one great work of that day will be , to execute judgement on ungodly murmurers and complainers : therefore as you fear the portion of murmurers then , do not live the life of murmurers now . 

Thirdly , this Doctrine reproves those who are so stupid and senseless in their sickness , as not to own the hand of Christ in their visitation : for seeing all diseases come from him , we are to receive them as the good messengers of Christ , saying with Naomi , Ruth 1.13 . The hand of the Lord is gone out against me . This stupidity of spirit is that sin whereby men slight and despise the judgements of God , so as neither to be affected in the sense of their sins , nor of God's displeasure for them : We have a clear instance of this sin , Jerem. 10.19 . ‚Äî I said truly , This is my grief , and I must bear it . In the beginning of the verse , the people sadly bewail their present afflictions : Woe is me for my hurt , my wound is grievous : now it aggravates their present misery , to be upbraided with their former stupidity : I said ( viz. in my trouble heretofore ) truly this is my grief , and I must bear it off as well as I can ; implying , that they formerly thought , that they could easily bear off the strokes of God. We often hear the like confident language from many stupid sinners on their sick beds , saying , Indeed I am not well , I am something out of order ; but I will strive with it , and hope to shake it off shortly , and so go on with my building , or trading , or purchasing , etc.  Thus usually men flatter themselves in their sickness , talking as if they were but beginning to live , when perhaps they are ready to die : these strive to put far from them the evil day , Amos 6.3 . Like those who boasted , that they had made a covenant with death , and an agreement with hell , Isa . 28.15 . as if they had made some bargain with Death and Hell , and had them in Bond and Covenant not to hurt them : this senseless spirit possessed those , Hos . 7.9 . Isa . 42.25 . This sin is forbidden , prov. 3.11 . My son , despise not the chastening of the Lord Beloved , it is a fearful thing to despise any affliction ; perhaps yet it is but little , but it comes from a great God , and upon a great Errand : therefore remember , Psalm 2.11 . If his wrath be kindled but a little , blessed are all they that put their trust in him . Consider further the evil and danger of this sin , in two particulars . 

First , It doth greatly provoke and call forth the wrath of God , Isa . 26.11 . When thy hand is lifted up , they will not see , they will take no notice of thy displeasure ; but they shall see : O then is the judgement of God fearful on the ungodly , when God's wrath puts them past security , when the seared conscience is turned into a gnawing conscience : I tell thee , sinner , if sickness will not awaken thee , hell william You know if a Father whip his Child to humble and melt him , it cuts the very heart of his Father to see his Child laugh in his face : So when God visits a sinner with sickness , or other afflictions , if he scorn his Rod , it must needs be an unspeakable provocation : for as it savours much of the spirit and grace of a Child of God , to be suitably affected to the various manifestations of God , so that it is his most inward pleasure to have God pleased , this puts gladness into his heart , Psal . 4.6 , 7. and if God in displeasure hide his face , he is troubled , Psal . 30.7 . so on the contrary , it is a sign of a base spirit , when , as it is said of Miriams' disease , God spits in his face , then to be so shameless and impudent , as if he could outface the frowns of his Majesty . 

Secondly , This speaks a man's condition to be incurable , Isa . 1.5 . Why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : as if they were grown so desperate , that corrections made them worse . Beloved , this stupidity doth frustrate the end and use of God's Visitation ; for they cannot hear the rod , if they do not feel the rod , because the rod speaks by its strokes ; therefore they loose its teaching , when they do not feel it smart : the condition then of such wretches must needs be hopeless , when they make Gods last remedy useless : as when a man is sick , first you seek to restore him by keeping him warm , and by wholesome diet ; if this fail , you send to the Physician ; but if the Physic do not stir the body , if he will not vomit , nor purge , nor bleed , than you look for nothing but death : So when mercies will not melt , nor Sermons change a sinner ; and after all , God sends sickness , or other judgements , and yet these do not work , what remains but a fearful looking for of eternal judgement ? And now to conclude this , we may see the dreadful condition of senseless and secure sinners on their deathbeds ; they say they have made their peace with God , when it is but a peace with sin , and an agreement with hell ; and that they hope for salvation , when perhaps the Pulse hath not many strokes to beaten , before they are sure of damnation : yet they will go confidently with the foolish Virgins , as it were , to the door of heaven , till Christ tell them there to their faces , he knows them not ; and thus they die , being wholly at ease and quiet : and carnal friends think they have made a comfortable end , when for my part I do not doubt to say , it is as comfortable to see men die drunk , as die secure . 

Fourthly , This doctrine reproves those who in their diseases trust to Physicians for health : Diseases ( you see ) are not at the command of Physicians , but of Christ . This was Asa his sin , 2 Chron. 16.12 . in his disease he sought not to the Lord , but to the Physicians . His sin was not in seeking to the Physicians , but in not seeking to the Lord I know it is a great sin , upon pretence of God's power , to be disobedient to his will in despising Physic , which God hath ordained to be his means to restore us to health : this sin is a tempting God , wherein we will try what God can do , and yet neglect what he commands ; but we must use the Physician , yet so , as to live by faith , and not by Physic : and therefore the rule is , to honour and use them as God's Instruments , but not to put them in God's place . 

Fifthly , It reproves those who usurp Authority , and use their own power to hurt or disease the bodies of men ; I mean not those who have authority from God and man to execute bodily punishments , as Magistrates , Parents , Masters , etc. nor would I abrogate the Law of self-preservation in the case of a violent and unavoidable assault : but my aim is , to convince those of their sin , who delight in quarrelling and fight ; who are said to enter into contention , prov. 18.6 . who neglect their callings to go to Cockpits , Bear-baits , etc. on purpose to quarrel and fight ; and such , who upon every little provocation , will be at daggers drawing ; no more with them , but a word and a blow , a lie and a stab ; and such mankeen beasts , who delight to feed on the wounds and blood of men , accounting it a piece of gallantry and bravery to beaten , hurt , wound and maim others . Now if all diseases are at the command of Christ , so that he bids them go , etc. then thou shouldst not usurp Christ's Authority , to hurt or disease others . Now that you may for ever abhor and be afraid of this sin , lay to heart these five Considerations . 

First , This is a damnable sin ; without speedy repentance , it will bring thee to hell : I say unto thee as Paul said to Ananias , Acts 23.3 . God shall smite thee , thou whited wall , for smiting thy brother : O look upon those strong arms and limbs burning with thy body and soul in hell ! O consider , what a poor credit it is to go valiantly to hell ! for this will be thy case : for if he that gives his brother but a foul word , be in danger of hellfire , Mat. 5.22 . how much greater danger art thou in , who woundest and hurtest that body which God hath bound thee upon pain of damnation , in the sixth Commandment , to preserve ! 

Secondly , Consider what spirit worketh in thee , when thou art fight and quarrelling with others : I say to thee , as Job in another case to his friend , Job 26.4 . Whose spirit came from thee ? Is this the holy , loving , humble , patient , meek , and peaceable spirit , which is so precious and savoury to God and men ? Is this the way to please and honour the God of thy life , and limbs , and strength , who stands by , and looks thee in the face , and sees thee like a fool in thy rage ? The Apostle clearly determines , that these fighting are fruits of your lusts , James 4.1 . And is this thy valour and gallantry , to fight so stoutly to fulfil a base lust ? 

Thirdly , Consider how thou dost hereby abuse thy own body : Is thy body a member of Christ , and thy hands and arms parts of Jesus Christ ? and wilt thou make a member of Christ a murderer ? 

Fourthly , Consider the person whom thou smitest ; Is he not one towards whom thou shouldst put on bowels of compassion , and whose salvation thou art bound to seek ; and dost thou think to bring him to heaven by Club-law ? Is he not fearfully and wonderfully made by God , in whose book all his members are written ? and wilt thou by thy inhuman and merciless blows mar such a choice piece of God's workmanship ? Is not , or may not his body be the Temple of the Holy Ghost , and an instrument to serve God and his generation ? and wilt thou by maiming and wounding him , make him lesle serviceable ? Nay further , he is made after the Image of the Invisible God ; and I tell thee , in striking him , thou dost , as it were , strike God in the face . 

Lastly , Consider the many sad and fearful consequences of this sin ; it breeds malice and revenge , and causeth further quarrels and contentions among persons and families ; it begets many chargeable suits at Law , to the expense of thy precious time and Estate : besides , men are hereby so fleshed with cruelty , and given to fight , that oftentimes the end of such , is either to be killed or hanged . 

Now for the defence of this cursed sin , men usually pretend these and suchlike Objections ; which I shall briefly answer , and so proceed to other Uses . 

Object . 1.  Must I then be branded for a base Coward , in suffering every one to abuse me ? 

Answ . He is a base Coward , that is so poor spirited as to serve a base lust , and to be a slave to a conquered Devil ; but he hath a Divine Spirit that will do the will of God , and rule his own spirit , and conquer himself : therefore show thy courage , by setting all thy might against thy sins . Tertullian useth this ingenious art to divert the Christians from beholding the spectacles of cruelty in the Heathenish Games , by directing them to behold how grace doth conflict with , and conquer over sin : Behold ( saith he ) wantonness destroyed by chastity ; falsehood slain by faith ; cruelty beaten by mercy ; malapertness overcome by modesty , & tales sunt apud nos agones , in quibus ipsi coronamur ; and such are the conflicts with us , in which we are crowned . De spectaculis , cap. 29.  So I say , if thou lovest fight , fight with thy sins , so shalt thou be crowned for a Champion , when a company of strong and stout fellows shall be damned for Cowards : besides , thou mayst have opportunity to show thyself no Coward , when thou art called to suffer reproach , poverty , banishment , imprisonment , or death , for the sake of Christ ; by thy cheerful and obedient suffering of which , thou wilt be more than a Conqueror over sin , the world , death , devils ; when a company of proud Swaggerers , who venture their limbs and lives in quarrelling and fight for the Devil , will basely turn Papists or Infidels , before they will venture any thing for Jesus Christ . 

Object . 2.  But I shall do them good by beating them , and make them rule their tongues , and carry themselves more civilly hereafter . 

Answ . thou mayst do them good by thy graces , but never expect to do them good by thy sins . The Scripture directs thee to a better way to do thy enemy good , Mat. 5.44 . Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them that despitefully use you , and persecute you . Rom. 12.21 . Overcome evil with good : And Solomon tells us , that a soft tongue , and not a hard cudgel , breaketh the bone . 

Object . 3.  How then must I live ? I can never be in quiet , I am abused by such that would provoke any man alive to strike them . 

Answ . I confess the world is full of many daring contentious spirits , whose mouths call for strokes , prov. 18.6 . and who , as Austin speaks , carry the Devil in their tongues : But this will not excuse thee ; if thou canst not rule their tongues , rule thy own hands . Remember David ; how was that Royal person rated by Shimei ! 2 Sam. 16.7 . Come out , come out thou bloody man , and thou man of Belial . ‚Äî But see how David takes it , verse . 10 , 12.  Let him curse , because the Lord hath said unto him , Curse David : It may be the Lord will look upon my affliction , and that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day . I would therefore seriously advice thee , when thou art thus provoked , to see heaven and hell looking thee in the face , and hear the Scripture crying in thy conscience , Tender good for evil , and go to heaven ; but , Tender evil for evil , and go to hell . This may work thy heart into David's frame , which appeared in his carriage towards Saul , 1 Sam. 24.13 . Wickedness proceeds from the wicked , but my hand shall not be upon him : So when thou art provoked by the insolent behaviour of unreasonable men , say , Wickedness proceeds from the wicked ; I can expect no better from such , but I will leave my cause with God , for I am resolved , that my hand shall not be upon him . 

Sixthly , This Doctrine reproves those who threaten to do hurt and mischief unto others : This was Jezabels' sin , who threatened to slay Elijah , as he had caused Baal's Prophets to be slain , 1 Kings 19.2 . So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them , by to morrow about this time . Thus Saul is said to breath out threatenings and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord , Acts 9.1 . and so those bloody Jews bound themselves under a curse , that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul And so many threaten others , that they will be even with them , that they will do them a mishief , or that they will be the death of them : Now thou seest , that power to hurt , or disease , or any other way to trouble a man , belongs to Jesus Christ ; and what ground hast thou to expect that Christ will exercise his power to fulfil thy lusts ? besides , this is a fearful curse of God upon many , that they are so far left to themselves , as to will , and intent , and threaten mischief , and thereby bring guilt upon their own souls ; and yet are never able to finish their sin , so as to do the hurt they intent to others : and this is a very torment to many a malicious wretch , that he life's travelling with iniquity , and yet is never able to bring it forth . Furthermore , how darest thou threaten to do a man hurt , when thou art bound to pray to God to do him good , yea , and to preserve him from that very evil which thou threatnest against him ? Again , it often appears , that God intends the very same mischief to thee , which thou intendest to others , Psal . 35.8 . Let his net that he hath hid catch himself , into that very destruction let him fall . But to conclude this , consider , that when many a man is threatening and devising mischief to others , a disease from Christ doth suddenly take him and turn him to hell , before he can bring it to pass . 

Seven , It reproves the great wickedness of such who curse others , by wishing diseases or other judgements upon them : We often hear such horrible speeches as these , A plague on him , a pox on him , etc. as if they , and not Christ , had power to command diseases to go , and they will go ; or as if the power of Jesus Christ must be the servant and instrument of a proud , froward , and malicious heart : This sin is forbidden to be used towards our worst enemies , Rom. 12.14 . Bless them that persecute you ; bless , and curse not : and it is made the sign of a graceless man , to have his mouth full of cursing , Rom. 3.14 . for his heart is full of pride , malice , and anger , and these fill his mouth with cursing . Consider , if thou curse others , God will curse thee , Psal . 109.17 , 18 , 19  As he loved cursing , so let it come unto him . ‚Äî Consider further , some will curse their friends , their husbands , wives , or children ; and sometimes God hath punished such cursed speeches in bringing their curses to pass . We read of a Mother that in a passion cursed her Son thus : Get thee gone , I would thou mightest never come again alive : and the same day her Son went into the water , and was drowned : Another woman said in her anger to her Child , The Devil take thee ; and presently the poor child was possessed with the Devil . These , and many more such dreadful examples should make all afraid of such , or any other words of cursing . Consider once more , that every man should have his heart filled with love unto , and earnest desires of the good of all men , and should be always in a frame to offer up these desires in prayer to God : Now how contrary to this is that devilish spirit which inclines thee to hate and to curse others ! The Apostle James sets out the great hypocrisy and wickedness of a man , who with the same tongue will bless God , and curse men , James 3.9 , 10.  Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing : My brethren , these things ought not so to be . 

Lastly , This Doctrine reproves those who hasten diseases and death to themselves by their own sins : I may reason with such sinners in Solomon's words , Eccles . 7.17 . Be not overmuch wicked , neither be thou foolish ; why shouldst thou die before thy time ? It is not meant the time absolutely appointed by God , for that cannot be prevented ; but it 's meant that time , which in the course of nature they might have probably lived unto ; as a Lamp will burn till the Oil be spent , but it may be quenched , or blown out sooner : So in the course of nature , many a man might have probably lived many a year , but oftentimes , either by a sudden blast of God , or by some diseases which are bred by his own sins , the lamp of his life is quickly blown out ; and some of such sins I shall here particularly reprove : I might instance in that horrible sin of self-murder , which ordinarily proceeds from pride , unbelief , revenge , covetousness , discontent , or despair : when men cannot despite God and man enough by their lives , they will attempt to do it by their deaths , and will venture with their own hands to cut the thread of their own lives , and to lose themselves out of the troubles of earth into the torments of hell . 

I might also mention the horrid sins of Treason , Murder , Witchcraft , Theft , etc. which sins bind their bodies to the wrath and justice of men , and their souls and bodies to the wrath and vengeance of God ; These sins bring men to be hanged like dogs , because they could not be contented to live like men . I shall instance in these five sins which do provoke God to visit men with diseases , some of which do of their own nature bring men to untimely sickness and death . 

1.  Persecution of God's people : This is a sin which doth not only bring everlasting damnation hereafter , but usually it also brings some fearful judgements on the bodies and families of Persecutors here . Hence we read , Psalm 55.23 . Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days . It would take up far more room than I can here spare , to instance in the fearful examples of God's vengeance upon the very bodies of the cruel enemies of God's Church and people : whereby we might see , that all the cruelty which the most barbarous persecutors have invented to torment the Christians with , hath not been comparable to those torments wherewith God hath tortured their Enemies with fearful and strange diseases . We read of that bloody Herod , who murdered the Infants , Matth. 2.16 . that he was smitten by the hand of God with a most shameful and painful disease , so that his body boiled and burned with heat , and his bowels were gnawn : he was tormented with a ravenous and insatiable appetite after meat : his privy parts were rotten , and full of filthy vermin : and after he had endured a while the horririble pangs of a lingering death , he died in desperate madness and misery : See Eusebius Ecclesiastic . Histor . Lib. 1.  Cap. 8.  

Tertullian , amongst other examples of the like kind , reports , that one Claudius Herminianus in Cappadocia , being enraged that his Wife was turned Christian , to revenge himself , did exercise much cruelty upon the precious Christians ; for which God did smite him with a fearful plague , wherewith after a while he was tormented , he died , ad Scapulam , cap. 3.  

Steven Gardiner , a bloody butcher in Queen Mary's days , hearing that Bishop Ridley and Master Latimer were burned at Oxford , rejoiced greatly , and being at dinner ate his meat merrily ; but whilst the meat was in his mouth , the wrath of God came upon him , so that he was taken from his board to bed , where continuing fifteen days in intolerable anguish , by reason he could not expel his urine , his body being miserably inflamed within , he was brought to a wretched end , with his tongue all black and swollen , hanging out of his blasphemous mouth . 

I shall conclude this , by warning all that either love their souls , lives , or posterity , or country , to take heed of wronging the precious people of God , the truth is , the Nation , which persecutors are a curse unto , and the souls of persecutors themselves are dearer to godly Christians , than all their own private interest which persecution can take from them : and therefore I say to all malicious enemies , as Tertullian said to Scapula , a Ruler in Carthage , and a cruel enemy to Christians . Parce tibi , si non nobis : parce Carthagini , si non tibi ‚Äî Spare thyself if thou wilt not spare us ; spare Carthage , if thou wilt not spare thyself . So I say , if ye will not spare the holy people of God , spare yourselves ; if ye will not spare yourselves , spare your families , spare your poor children ; if you will not spare your families , spare the precious nation , spare London , spare England ; for you swallow up all , by swallowing up God's people . 

The second sin which I shall here reprove , is unworthy receiving the Lords Supper . God often punisheth this sin with bodily diseases . Hence we read , 1 Cor. 11.30 . For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep : Now that you may know the evil and danger of this sin , I shall show you what it is to eat and drink the Lords Supper unworthily : A man eats and drinks the Lords Supper unworthily , when he is without the gracious qualifications which make the heart fit , and meet , and agreeable to this blessed Ordinance . The best way to understand this , is to consider what is in the Ordinance , and what is in the heart ; and then by comparing them together , to see whether they do meet and agree : as for example , in the Lord's Supper Jesus Christ crucified , with all the blessings of the Gospel are showed forth , 1 Cor. 11.26 . well , and there is a Believer who by faith sees and discerns the Lord's Body , as it is set forth therein : now such a heart and the ordinance do meet ; the heart agrees , and is suitable to the ordinance , and so is fit , and worthy to receive it ; but on the other hand , here is a dead unbelieving sinner that hath no principle or faculty to discern Jesus Christ , or to receive him as hereby offered ; therefore he comes unworthily , he is not fit ; for his heart and the ordinance do not agree , but he is like a blind man before the most glorious show . Again , here is spiritual food , meat indeed , and drink indeed , to feed and satisfy a soul , with grace , and pardon , and salvation : Well , and here is a poor soul hungering and thirsting after this very food . Now such a man is fit , and comes like a hungry man to a good and wholesome feast ; but here is another dead sinner that sees and feels his want of nothing , and so is no more fit and meet for such an ordinance , than a man that lies dead in a Coffin is to eat the bread and wine which is dealt at his funeral : nay , further , you may see the unworthiness of a wicked man , in that his heart is against the Lord's Supper ; as a man is very unfit for a feast , when he loathes , and his stomach doth rise against every dish on the table , and against all the company : So , my brethren , a man is very unfit for the Lords Supper , when his heart hate's and riseth against Christ , and against holiness , against all godly Christians . Sirs , here is set before us that which condemns all sins , and which requires the greatest strictness and holiness : so that to be sure the man that hate's Christ in a Minister , or in a Christian , cannot but hate him in the Lord's Supper . Well , you see who are unworthy , and who by this sin bring diseases and other judgements of God upon themselves in this life , and also damnation on their bodies and souls in the life to come . I might here also tell you , that the godly themselves , for want of the present exercise of grace suitable to this Ordinance , may bring diseases and death upon themselves ; for as Christ with all his benefits is herein actually set forth , so grace should actually come forth to meet him , to take , receive , and enjoy him ; as when a feast is ready dressed and disht up , those that are fit guests must not only have life and stomaches , etc. but they must also actually eat and drink . The application is easy : I shall therefore conclude this reproof in seriously warning all to take heed of unworthy , receiving the Lord's Supper : would any man eat that which he knows would breed the Pestilence , or the Fever , or the Dropsy ? Why , Christ tells you , if you come unworthily , you eat and drink judgement to yourselves : And certainly , though the food be precious and wholesome , and it is your duty to receive it worthily ; yet by unworthy receiving , you do that which may bring the Plague , Pox , Fever , etc. upon you , and without sound repentance will bring damnation upon your bodies and souls for ever . 

The third sin to be here reproved , is niggardliness : this is a sin whereby men restrain from themselves the lawful use of the creature ; they have not hearts to take and use the creatures to those ends which God hath made them good for , but basely defraud their own backs and bellies , by grudging themselves the meat , drink , clothes , recreations , physic , which nature requires , and God allows : The word speaks expressly against this sin , Eccles . 6.12 . such men play the thiefs , in robbing God of the honour , and themselves of the use of these mercies : and they love their ‚óè states better than themselves ; and by preserving their riches , they disease and destroy their own bodies . 

4.  Drunkenness , to which may be add‚óè the sin of gluttony . The former bring themselves to untimely sicknesses an‚óè death by taking too little of God's creature's , and these by taking too much consider the evil and danger of thi‚óè sin of drunkenness in these five particulars . 

1.  Drunkenness doth unman the drunkard , and turns him into a very beast . Henc‚óè saith the Prophet , Hos . 4.11 . Whoredom and wine , and new wine take away the heart . This is given as one reason of the people's wickedness mentioned in this Chapter , because they were so besotted with drunkenness and whoredom , which sins took away all knowledge and wisdom from them . Augustine saith , Ebrietas est blandus daemon , quam qui habet , seipsum non habet ; Drunkenness is a flattering Devil , which he that hath , hath not himself . Drunkenness is voluntaria insania , wilful madness , as Seneca speaks : A Drunkard , though at other times he may be learned , yet now he can neither understand , discourse , see , go , ride , nor do any business as becomes a reasonable man : look on a drunkard , and consider , yonder goes one with the immortal soul and precious body of a man ; yonder staring eyes , stammering tongue , staggering limbs , would , if they were filled with the Spirit , be precious instruments to honour God , and become blessings to man ; but what a beastly creature is he made by this filthy sin ! 

2.  A drunkard is unfit for any employment , he is good for nothing : Who will venture his business with a drunken Servant ? or his life with a drunken Physician ? or his soul with a drunken Minister ? how many thousand of men's lives have been lost by drunken soldiers ? Whatever a man's estate be , he may be cheated of all when he is drunk . 

3.  A drunkard is unfit for all societies , and that for diverse reasons : I shall mention but this one , viz. a man cannot commit a secret to a drunkard ; who will choose such a friend to whom a man can speak nothing , but what he will have proclaimed in every Alehouse or Tavern in the Country ? Now what ever a man says to a drunkard , no body knows but that the next time he is drunk , he will tell all . 

4.  Drunkenness betrays a man to all sin : for a man at the best is full of the principles of Sin : Now drunkenness is apt to set all a work , and leaves a man incapable of many restraints which might be used to a sober person ; who knows what a man full of sin may do in his drunken mood , when he hath neither grace , nor reason , nor counsel of others , nor fear , nor shame to restrain him ? and therefore what horrid sins are committed in drunkenness ! swearing , cursing , whoring , fight ; yea , and murdering also . Clitus was a dear and faithful friend to Alexander , yet Alexander murders him when he was drunk , though he was ready to kill himself for it when he was sober . 

Augustine reports , that a son of one in Hippo , who was too much cockered by his Father , came home drunk , in which sin he would have ravished one of his Sisters , slew his Father , and wounded to death two of his other Sisters . 

Lastly , drunkenness shuts a man out of heaven , and by untimely sicknesses and death hastens him to hell . The Apostle assures us , 1 Cor. 6.10 . that no drunkards shall inherit the kingdom of God. O what a fearful sin is this ! it hurries a man into eternity , and sinks him into hell when he comes there : drunkenness is a sin which of its own nature breeds Dropsies , Consumptions , and other diseases , as we read , Hos . 4.7 . The Princes makes themselves sick with bottles of wine ; and daily examples witness the sudden and untimely death of many drunkards : It is reported of one , that when he was drunk , as he was getting up on his Mare , he said in a drunken frolic , that his Mare would carry him to the Devil ; and his Mare threw him down and broke his neck . Sirs , do not venture to be drunk , lest you fall into hell before you be sober . 

The last sin which I shall here reprove , is the beastly sin of whoredom : This is a sin against a man's own body , 2 Cor. 6.18 . hence we read , prov. 6.26 . The Adulteress will hunt for the precious life . See further prov. 7.22 . 26.27 . He goeth after her as an ox goeth to the slaughter . For she hath cast down many wounded , yea , many strong men have been slain by her . Her house is the way to hell , going down to the chambers of death . And thus you see , that by this filthy sin , men and women sacrifice their health , estates , names , bodies , and souls to their stinking lusts , carrying a filthy and guilty soul in a rotten body whilst they live , and shutting themselves out of heaven into hell when they die . Now that this use of reproof may leave some deep convection in your consciences , consider what thy health and life is giu‚óèn thee for , viz. that thou mayst have opportunity of serving and honouring the great God , and of providing for eternity : Now therefore what a bloody wretch art thou to thyself , that thou shouldst by thy own sins shorten thy space of repentance , and put a sad period to all thy blessed opportunities , and days of Salvation , and dispatch thyself beyond all ordinances , and means , and hop‚óèss , and possibilities o‚óè Salvation , and so make thyself unable to live before thou art ready to die ! 

Use 3  Of Consolation to the truly godly . This Doctrine is a great ground of comfort to all the children of God , whereby they may see that all sicknesses , dangers , and deaths come through the hands of their own father : for it is a most certain way of comfort to the godly in any sickness , to bring their hearts to the first Cause and Author of their Visitation ; for if they are at peace with him , they will be sure to find peace and comfort in their affliction . Hence the Apostle teacheth us , Phil. 4.6 , 7.  Be careful for nothing ( that is , do not torture , and distracted , and break your hearts with sinful cares and fears ) but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known unto God : ( bring your hearts and desires unto him ) And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus . Perhaps thou hast nothing to keep thy estate from loss , nor thy body from aches and pains , nor thy name from reproach , nor thy life from death . But however , thou shalt have the peace of God to keep thy heart full of grace and comfort through Christ Jesus ; and if the heart be thus kept , the blessing and comfort of all is kept in it ; for in this case thou mayst lose friends out of thy company , riches out of thy estate , health and ease out of thy body , and yet thou mayst keep the peace and comfort of all in thy heart . 

Now that your hearts may be refreshed with this Doctrine , I shall show herein these five grounds of comfort . 

1.  In respect of the season of the visitation . 2.  Of the end . 3.  In respect of the godly themselves who are visited , 4.  In respect of death . Lastly , in respect of the day of judgement . 

1.  In respect of the season of our Visitation , we may be assured that Jesus Christ will choose the best and fittest season to visit us in . See 1 Pet. 1.6 . Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season ( if need be ) ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations : This is an argument of comfort , that our afflictions come in a season when we have most need of them . Husbandmen know that there is a season when the ground hath need of frost and snow ; and parents know that there is a season when their children have need of the rod : And so there are seasons , wherein we that are God's husbandry , and Gods children , have need of his fatherly chastisements ; and in these times he chooseth to visit us . 

I shall contract all that I will say of this , in the application of a general truth to this particular case , viz. that the time and season of God's remarkable Providence , is called the fullness of time in Scripture : So we read , Gal. 4.4 . When the fullness of time was come , God sent forth his Son ‚Äî so that place seems something pertinent to our purpose , Eph. 4.10 . That in the dispensation of the fullness of times , he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth , even in him . Where note , that this is the great and mysterious work of God , to gather together in one full body all his Elect , that those which are already in heaven , with those who are to be gathered out of the world , may all meet in Christ their Head ; and so be the fullness of him that fills all in all : Now this work is said to be done in the fullness of time : So that this is the glorious work which God is carrying on by ordinances , mercies , afflictions , diseases , death ; he is gathering all his people together , bringing them into a body unto their head ; and , I say , this is all done in the fullness of time . 

Now there are two things which make a fullness of time . 

1.  When it 's a time set and appointed by God for such a dispensation ; a time full of the Decree and Counsel of God , and wherein his Decrees are fulfilled : So the coming of Christ was in the fullness of time , viz. in the time set by God.  

2.  When time is fitted and prepared for such a work ; in which respect also Christ came in the fullness of time : time had been travelling , as it were , for this many ages : Prophecies , and promises , and the faith and expectation of Believers were full of Jesus Christ ; and so the time being fitted for his coming , he comes in the fullness of time . 

Now to apply this to the case in hand ; whenever sickness or death comes , it is in the fullness of time . 

1.  In that time which is set by the wisdom and counsel of our Father , for the good of his children ; he set the time of thy birth , and of thy new birth : so he hath appointed the time of thy visitation , and of thy death ; which are all times appointed to demonstrate and glorify his infinite power and love towards thee . 

2.  They come in a time most fit for such a work . Sin grows to such an head , that its time for sickness , or some other affliction to come and bring it down : Grace grows to such a strength , that now it 's able to bear a trial : a storm is ready to fall ; therefore , saith God , now it 's to time to fetch my child home : The Christian is grown so ripe , that its time to bring him to heaven , as a shock of corn in its season . Thus you see for your comfort , that sickness and death come from Christ in the best and fittest season : Sickness never comes , but to bring thee nearer heaven ; and Death shall never come , but to lose thee into heaven . Ah Christian ! heaven and happiness never come out of season . 

Secondly , Comfort , in respect of the end of all sicknesses and death ; they come from Jesus Christ for our good . We read , 2 Cor. 4.17 . Our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory : where we see , that in all our afflictions there is a secret Power working us to heaven and salvation . As for example , in a Fever , Ague , or Consumption ‚ñ™ etc. we feel a Power working outwardly against us , against our health , strength , case , and life ; so there is a mighty Power working inwardly for us , working us from sin and the world , to God , and Christ , and Heaven . Hence is that known and tried Scripture ; I say , it 's a tried Scripture , it hath comforted many thousand hearts , I mean Rom. 8.28 . We know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are called according to his purpose . Methinks this Scripture is a Spring which always runs with new and fresh comfort ; and it 's a sure way to find comfort , to look upon all our diseases , and other afflictions , through this Scripture . Now to apply the comfort of it to the present case , consider what is that good which all things work together for ; and this you may know by the following verses , wherein the Apostle demonstrates this truth , That all things work together for our good : therefore , saith he , verse . 31.  What shall we say to these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ? that is , let us look upon all our afflictions and miseries , and then look upon our Predestination , Vocation , Justification , and Glorification , mentioned vers . 29 , 30.  And we may joyfully conclude , that seeing God is for us , so as to predestinate , call , justify , and glorify us ; and these links can never be broken ; then nothing can be against us , but all shall work for our good ‚ñ™ so that the great good that all things work for , is not to make the godly the great Gallants of the world , but to bring them grace and peace here , and glory hereafter : and all sicknesses , diseases , and deaths , and all other dispensations , are united and joined together in this work , to bring Soulsaving good to them that love God. And the clear cause of this is in the Doctrine , viz. because our Saviour hath the working of all these things ; he sends , and rules , and governs them : and therefore there must needs be a Fatherly work in them , because Jesus Christ , as our Father and Saviour , sends them to us , and orders them for us : That of the Apostle makes clearly for this , 1 Cor. 3.23 . Death is yours : and by the same rule , sickness is ours , and for our good . But why ours ? Answ . Because the Lord of sickness and death is ours . Hence we read , Phil. 1.21 . To die is gain . Sickness is gain , and death is gain to God's Children . Many a Child of God gains more by a month's sickness , then by the outward mercies of many years ; and death will bring you more gain in one hour , than all the prayers , and Sacraments , and Sermons of a whole age : and therefore labour to see your gains as real and present to the eye of Faith , as your pains , troubles and losses are to the eye of Sense : and in your sad parting with those things which sickness and death take you from , comfort your hearts with those things which they bring you unto ; say , Farewell my dear and pleasant Country , thou hast fed me well , and clothed me well , but I must leave thee for a better Country , that is , an heavenly , Hebr. 11.26 . Farewell my inward and faithful friends ; farewel my dear Jonathans' ! How pleasant have you been to me ! Your love to me is wonderful : Methinks when I am with you , I feel the truth of Tertullias saying of the fellowship of the Primitive Christians : Animo anim√°que miscemur ; Our very hearts and souls do enter into , and are mingled and united with one another . Many a sweet meeting and sad parting I have had with you ; but I must leave you a while , to go to better friends in Heaven : Magnus illie nos charorum numerus expectat ; I have a great company of dear friends in the other world which look for me , and will rejoice to see me with them ; with whom I shall always be serious , yet never sad ; always merry , and yet never vain . 

Farewell my sweet Sabbaths , savoury Sermons , melting Sacraments ; farewel my dear Bible , and all the blessed Ordinances , wherein I have seen the Lord , even the Lord in the land of the living . I must no longer look in these glasses , but go where I shall see him face to face . 

Farewell my dear yoke-fellow , parents , my sweet children , my beloved brothers and sisters ; I must leave you all , to go to a better Father , and Husband , and Brother in heaven . 

Farewell my good and convenient house , my sweet place of secret and Family-worship ! I must be gone to my house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens . 

Farewell my poor , but precious body ! go thou and sleep in Jesus in the earth , whilst my Soul is reigning with Jesus in heaven , where I shall remember thee , and long to see thee , till I meet thee again clothed with Immortality and Glory . These things , Christians , are the comforts of a sickbed , the sweet joys of a deathbed . 

3.  Comfort , in respect of the godly who are visited : Herein is thy comfort , that thou art a true part and member of Jesus Christ , from whom all diseases come ; so that whatsoever Christ doth to thee , he doth to himself : I was sick , saith Christ , when his members were sick , Mat. 25.36 . So when the body is dead , the poor ghastly corpse continues still joined and united to Jesus Christ . Hence the bodies of believers are said to sleep in Jesus , and are called the dead in Christ , 1 These . 4.14 , 16. and it 's a most sweet and savoury consideration , when a man looks on such a sad spectacle as a loathsome diseased body , or thinks on the rotten carcase when the body is dead and sown in corruption , then to fix the eye of Faith upon his glorious head , at the right hand of the Father : As thus ; look on thy face covered with the Small Pox , and then look on the Face of Jesus Christ : look on thy bones staring upon thee in a Consumption , and then look upon the glory and beauty of Jesus Christ . Nay , go further , look upon thyself as it were in the grave , and see thy ghastly skull lying in the dust among the worms of the earth , and then look on thy glorious Head in Heaven : and so comfort thyself with this , that as vile and loathsome a spectacle as thy diseased body is now , and thy dead body will be shortly , yet it is a precious member of Jesus Christ , who will by his infinite power , change and fashion this contemptible dust into the likeness of his glorious body in heaven . 

4.  Comfort , in respect of death ; it comes to the godly without a sting : In this we are taught to triumph , 1 Cor. 15.55 , 56.  OH death , where is thy sting ? ‚Äî Now to clear up your comfort in this , consider , that sickness and death are said to sting , when God as a revenging Judge sends them to execute the curse of the law for sin ; so that death is compared to a fearful Serpent , which kills and devours all the men and women in the world : And , saith the Apostle , the sting of this Serpent Death , is sin ; it 's sin that makes the sting ; and then he adds , the strength of sin is the law : The strength that sin hath to sting , is from the curse of the Law , and the Law hath its strength and power from the wrath of God ; for the law worketh wrath , Rom. 4.15 . So that by all you see , that by the sting of death is meant the dreadful torments of hell , which at death come from the wrath of God through the curse of the Law for sin . OH poor Christless sinner ! what a miserable case art thou in ? Look well as thou fittest in thy seat , and thou mayst see this stinging Serpent Death lie under thy feet ; when thou liest down , this Serpent lies under thy bed ; when thou art at meat , this Serpent lies under thy table ; when thou goest out of thy house , thou mayst see this Serpent at the door , ready to sting thee to he‚óè But now here comes in the unspeaka‚óè comfort of believers ; for though death h‚óè power to kill them , yet it hath no po‚óèer to sting them ; because all the cau‚óè of Death's sting are taken away by Jes‚óè Christ . 

1.  Sin is gone ; for this lamb of G‚óè hath taken away the sins of the world , Jo‚óè 1.29 . Observe , they are taken away , ‚óè if they had never been . Hence , 1 Pet. ‚óè 24.  Who his own self bore our sins in his ow‚óè body on the tree : So that by the righteousness of Christ given to us by God , and received of us by Faith , and thereby ma‚óè our own , we are fully cleared and absolved from sin , and God will never imput it to us . 

2.  It follows , that the curse of the Law is gone ; for Christ hath delivered us fro‚óè the curse of the law , being made a cur‚óè for us : So that the law hath no strength t‚óè bind us to punishment , there being neither sin to bind us for , nor punishment t‚óè bind us unto . 

3.  The wrath of God , which makes th‚óè punishment , is also taken away , for it i‚óè God that justifieth , Rom. 8.33 . and we hau‚óè thereby peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ , Rom. 5.1 . So that God is ours , and for us , to love , bless , and save , and glorify us : and therefore every believer may with comfort hold up the Blood of Christ in the very face of the King of Terrors , and say , Here is my Christ , my righteousness ; but , OH death , where is thy sting ? 

Nay further , Death is now changed from coming to execute the curses of the Law , for it comes to fulfil the blessings of the Gospel ; for death to a believer , is a work of a reconciled Father , whereby he loses his child out of earth into heaven ; so that we may see death so full of the love and goodness of God , that it should even endear it to us , and make it lovely and precious to our souls . That is a most comfortable promise , Joh. 8.51 . Verily , verily I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death . It is not meant , he shall never die , as the Jews understood it , ver . 52.  And I conceive it is not only intended , he shall never die the second death ; but the meaning also seems to be this , that a Child of God shall see so much of God , and Christ , and Heaven , that he may even overlook the fears of death , which are swallowed up by God , and Christ , and Life . 

Lastly , Comfort , in respect of our glorious victory over all diseases , and death , at the day of Judgement . This victory consists in two things . 

1.  In putting a final period to all diseases , and death : Sickness shall never trouble us more , and death shall never kill us more : I warrant thee Christian , thy head will never ache in heaven , and for certain there will be no Funerals in that Country , but corruptible must put on incorruption , and mortal shall put on immortality . 2.  In that the bodies of believers shall then be never the worse for the diseases and death which they have suffered ; but the bodies which were sown in dishonour , shall be raised in glory . Beloved , a Saint may live comfortably in any condition , by living in the joyful knowledge of the day of judgement . Hence , when the Apostle had propounded this as an argument of comfort , that yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry ; He adds this , Now , the just shall live by faith : meaning , they shall live a life of holiness and comfort in believing the day of judgement . And Saint Paul having made a glorious description of that great day , 1 These . 4.15 , 16 , 17. makes this use of it , verse . 18.  wherefore comfort one another with these words : And in this the godly did comfort themselves , Rom. 8.23 . And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the first-fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption ; to wit , the redemption of our bodies . This is a most comfortable life , to live as those that are always groaning and waiting for the day of judgement . A believer may apply this to his comfort against any particular trouble : Art thou disgraced and reproached in thy name ? summon , as it were , all thy accusers to the day of judgement , and believe what a name thou shalt have then , and that thou shalt be sure to come off with credit at that day , when the glorious Judge of quick and dead shall confess thee before his Father , and Angels , and Men : and as mean and obscure as thou seemest now , the world will have other thoughts of thee , when they see thee appear with Christ in glory , Col. 3.4 . And therefore we learn , that one great work of that day will be , to make a clear and open manifestation of the sons of God , Rom. 8.19 . 

Art thou troubled with unreasonable and wicked men , so that thou mayst say with David , My soul is among Lions , and I lie even among them that are set on fire ? Psal . 57.4 . Consider what Christ will do to them at the day of judgement , and what work the great shout will then make among the profane Swaggerers and Ranters o‚óè the world . 

So when thou art troubled with diseases and the fearful thoughts of death , consider thy glorious victory over them at th‚óè day of judgement , 1 Cor. 15.54 . When thi‚óè corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed u‚óè in victory . Look on this corruptible an‚óè mortal body , which is now sometimes s‚óè loathsome with diseases , that a man ca‚óè scarce endure to carry it about him , or to lie with it , and will shortly be so contemptible , that the worms of the earth wil‚óè crawl and feed all over it ; and these ver‚óè arms , and thighs , and legs , may be throw‚óè up , and lie like the bones of horses an‚óè sheep at the graves mouth ; yet the day i‚óè coming , when this corruptible and mortal body shall put on immortality and glory : and , saith the Apostle , then , at that day , shall come to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . Beloved , here diseases conquer the strongest bodies , and death overcomes the lives of the best and greatest men , and the grave devours and eats up our flesh ; but then we shall obtain a glorious victory over all , when in despite of them , the bodies of Believers shall be raised incorruptible and immortal ; and diseases , death , and the grave , which have prevailed for so many thousand years to swallow up so many million of men and women , shall themselves be swallowed up of life , and swallowed up in victory . 

Last Use is of Exhortation . I shall conclude this discourse with a Use of Exhortation , which I shall first direct to all in general , and then more particularly , 1.  To such who are in health . 2.  To such who have been sick , but are recovered . 3.  I shall direct to some duties to be practised in time of sickness . 

I begin with the first ; wherein I shal‚óè exhort all to these six duties , grounded o‚óè this Doctrine . 

1.  Live in the knowledge and sense o‚óè this truth , that the health and lives of al‚óè men are at the will and command of Jesus Christ . 

1.  See your own health and lives at th‚óè command of Christ ; acknowledge with David , Psal . 31.15 . My times are in thy hands . Consider that of the Apostle , Jam ‚ñ™ 4.13 , 14.  Go to now , ye that say , To day or to morrow we will go into such a City ‚ñ™ and continue there a year , and buy , and sell , and get gain ; whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow : For what is your life ? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time , and presently vanisheth away . Observe , Go to , ye that say , To day , or to morrow . Why , a day is but a little while , and it is but a short time till to morrow : Well , but time hath a teeming womb , and you know not what a day may bring forth . We often see one day working strange changes and alterations with men : a day may bring you into eternity , and put an eternal period to all your designs ; and it is most certain , that you know not what shall be on the morrow : thou mayest be sick or dead to morrow ; thou mayest be in heaven or hell to morrow : o , but sure there is no such danger ! yes that there is ; and therefore it is added , What is your life ? It is even a vapour that appeareth a little while , and presently vanisheth away . As a vapour fills the air , and makes a show a little while , and then presently vanisheth away : So man appears a little while in his family , in the Field , Market , or Congregation , but presently vanisheth out of sight . How would the serious thoughts of this make men hasten to repent , if they did know that there is very great danger , that unbelief and impenitency may bring them to hell before to morrow : If so , surely they would not venture one hour out of Jesus Christ , for as many mountains of gold , as there are sands upon the Seashore ; yet for want of this , poor souls are still deferring their repentance till to morrow , until at last death seizeth upon them , and leaves them never a morrow to repent in . So , how vain would the world appear to them , if they did consider that they could not say , they should enjoy their riches , and pleasures , and preferments till to morrow ! Consider thus with thyself , I have provided meat , but I may be in Eternity before I eat it ; I have bought me good clotheses , but I may be put in a winding-sheet before I wear them ; I have sowed great fields , but I may be in hell before I reap them : Look on all the world about thee , and tell thy soul , This is but a poor portion , when thou mayst lose all in a breath . 

2.  See thy Friends and Relations in the hands of Jesus Christ . Beloved , herein appears the great difference betwixt our worldly and heavenly enjoyments : As fo‚óè our heavenly enjoyments , we are best whe‚óè we are most fit to enjoy them ; but as fo‚óè our worldly comforts , we are best when w‚óè are most fit to lose them : as thus , it is ou‚óè holiness and happiness , to be fit to abide for ever with God and Christ in heaven ; but we are most holy and spiritual , when we are in a readiness to part with Husbands , Wives , Parents , Children , etc.  Now what poor comforts are these , when a man is in the best frame , when he can be content to be without them ? 

3.  See the great ones of the world in the hands of Jesus Christ : O what a sight is this , to look upon all the Kings , and Nobles and Gallants of the world , in their very fa‚óè into Eternity ? Sirs , as you see them catching at the Crowns , and Honours , and Estates of the world , so see diseases and death catching at them : We have this passage , Psal . 49.12 . ‚Äî 20.  Man being in honour abideth not , he is like the beasts that perish ; that is , say some , like beasts that die of the Murrain , which are thrown away for stinking Carrion , which is good for nothing . Did we consider this , we should not make men our trust and confidence . See Jer. 17.5 . What a cursed sin is this , for a man that hath the Immortal God to be his trust , to rest on a lump of flesh , that cannot so much as keep himself from being sick , or dead , or damned for one day ? Psal . 146.3 , 4.  Put not your trust in Princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help . His breath goeth forth , he returns to his earth ; in that very day his thoughts perish . Observe , the Psalmist pleads against putting our trust in the Princes and great ones o‚óè the world , because they are dying men , and in the day of death their thoughts perish . Many great men have great thoughts of honours and preferments , and perhaps thoughts of doing much mischief to God's Church and people ; but death comes , and in that very day their thoughts perish . In Esth . 6. we read , that Hamans' thoughts were full of this project , to have himself honoured , and Mordecai hanged , vers . 4 , 6.  But in on‚óè night God turned the scales , by a Divin‚óè touch upon the King's heart ; and so Mordecai is brought to the honour , and Hama‚óè to the gallows . O what became of thi‚óè great Courtiers thoughts , when instead o‚óè the honour which he expected , he had th‚óè halter which he deserved ! And thus w‚óè find that God hath gracious thoughts o‚óè love and mercy to his people ; and the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever , and the thoughts of his heart to all generations . But men have thoughts of setting up themselves , and throwing down the Church of God ; but they fade in their ways , and their thoughts perish . 

Lastly , See your enemies in the hands of Christ : What are they all , when they may be sick , or dead , or damned before they can do thee any hurt ! Isa . 51.12 ay , even I am he that comforteth thee : Who art thou , that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as grass ? We may learn here , that a Christians fear of man , proceeds from his ignorance of three things . 

1.  Of God : therefore , saith God , I , even I am he that comforteth thee . Sirs , if there be more power , and goodness , and wisdom in him that comforts us , than there is strength , and subtlety , and malice in them that trouble us , what need we be afraid ? do but believe who comforts thee , and thou needst not fear or care who trouble's thee ; for God can take away the troubles of man , but man cannot take away the comforts of God.  

2.  Of themselves : Therefore saith God , Who art thou ? What thou who art my child , and hast me thy father to comfort thee , and yet wilt thou be afraid of a man ! O what a poor-spirited creature art thou , to be afraid of a man ! 

3.  Of the vanity of man Therefore saith God , He is a man , and can do no more than a man : and he is a man that shall die and wither as the grass . Christians , God , and Sickness , and Death , and Hell are nearer your enemies than they are to you ; and I tell you , do but believe God's threatenings against them , and you will see no reason to fear their threatenings against you . 

Secondly , live in a holy awe and fear of Jesus Christ , Psal . 33.8 . Let all the earth fear the Lord ; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him : A man that is a tenant at will can tell you , he is afraid of offending his Landlord : for , saith he , I live under him , I am at his mercy , he can keep me in , and turn me out of my living when he william Beloved , if we knew the power of Christ , as well as we do the power of a Landlord ; and were as much afraid of hell , as we are of losing our livings , the same reason would prevail with us to be afraid of offending him ; for we live at his mercy , and life and death is at his Will : let me therefore warn you , as God did the Israelites , speaking to them of Jesus Christ , Exod. 23.21 . Beware of him , and obey his voice ; provoke him not , for ( if you continue in your sins ) he will not pardon your transgressions : for my Name is in him . Upon this ground we are required to fear him , Psal . 2.9 , 10 , 11.  He will break his enemies with a rod of iron , and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel : Therefore it is made the wisdom of Kings and Judges of the earth , to serve the Lord with fear . It is very observable , that as God's Attributes give being and life to a Christians graces ; so a Christians Graces bring glory to God's Attributes : as for example , the Power and Truth of God causeth Faith , and the Goodness of God causeth Love , and the Greatness of God causeth Fear in the hearts of the godly : So God hath a peculiar name of praise and glory from the graces of his people ; because of their faith and hope in him , he is called the trust , and confidence , and hope of his people ; and because of their delight in him , he is called the song and joy of his people ; and because of their awe and dread of him , he is called the fear of his people , the fear of Isaac , Gen. 31.42 . See Isa . 8.13 . Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself , and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread . We have a special instance of this in Job , cap. 31. in which Chapter Job by many solemn protestations and serious imprecations asserts his innocence in several duties , as in chastity , equity to his servants , charity to the poor , etc.  Now he clears himself , that the reason of his integrity in these things , was not because he was afraid of ever a man alive . Hence , saith he , verse . 34.  Did I fear a great multitude , or did the contempt of families terrify me ? no , no , he had a great awe upon his heart , vers . 23.  For destruction from God was terror to me , and by reason of his greatness I could not endure . How contrary to this is the secure temper of many , who rage in malice against God and godliness , and fill the land that bears th‚óè‚óè with lies , oaths , drunkenness , whoredoms , injustice , Sabbath-breaking , contempt of Ordinances , etc. yet they make no more of God and his Judgements , than the very stones or dirt under their feet . But o what work will diseases and death make among these secure and senseless Atheists shortly ! methinks I hear the wrath of God roaring against them ; and the Lion hath roared , who will not fear ? Amos 3.8 . Be persuaded then to stand in awe of God ; for which purpose lay up that Scripture , Eccles . 8.12 , 13.  Though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , that fear before him . But it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow , because he feareth not before God.  

3.  Labour to make your peace with God : you see what he can do against you ; he can disease , or kill , or damn you when he will ; therefore it 's your great wisdom and safety to have this God on your side , and to be at peace with him . The Scripture persuades to this duty with this argument , Isa . 27.4 , 5.  Who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ? I would go through them , I would bur‚óè them together : meaning , if my enemies , who are but as briers and thorns before me , who am a consuming fire , will fight it out against me , I will burn them up quickly , I will have them in hell presently : but , saith he , verse . 5.  If they will ( by sincere faith and prayer ) take hold on my strength , and make peace with me , they shall make peace with me . Now to prevail with you herein , consider what this peace with God is ; it 's that blessed State , whereby God in Christ is for the good , and happiness , and eternal salvation of Believers ; and whereby they are wholly turned and set for the service and glory of God : So that in this case , a man may improve his knowledge and faith by all the advantages both from Scriptures and Creatures , and get his soul filled with the highest thoughts of the infinite power , and wisdom , and goodness of God ; and then boldly say , This is my infinitely great and good Father , and all his glorious power , and wisdom , and love is on my side : then he may look into the world , and see all things working busily about him ; and then conclude , that this is the greatest work upon the wheels to bring happiness and salvation to me , and to that body of which I am a member . And then on the other hand he may look in himself , and see all the powers of his body and soul united in this great design to please , and praise , and enjoy God. So that by these things you may learn what it is to be at peace with God : whereby you may also see what is the enmity betwixt God and a sinner ; it is that whereby a sinner is against God , so as to be fearfully bend to hate , and deny , and despite him ; and God is against the sinner , so as to blast , and curse , and damn him ; so that this is thy case , sinner , if thou art not at peace with God , all manner of diseases , and all kinds of deaths and dangers , yea , and all the curses of the Bible are against thee , because the God of all these is against thee . I would therefore seriously persuade you to come to agreement with God ; which that you may do , let me tell you , that I am this day sent as an Ambassador of peace from the Lord of life and death , who hath committed to me the word of reconciliation : So that I have authority from him to offer most blessed conditions of peace , viz. if you will this day sincerely turn from sin to God , and truly receive Jesus Christ as he is offered in the Gospel , you shall have the great God to be your Father , his only begotten Son , the true God , to be your Husband and Saviour , the infinite and blessed Spirit to be your Comforter ; you shall have grace and peace to abide with you here , and an everlasting Kingdom of glory to possess and enjoy hereafter . Sirs , are not these blessed and honourable terms ? Well , where lies the difference ? Answ . In nothing but sin : Now what a fearful case is this , that after God the Father hath sent his only begotten Son , and after he hath died the most shameful , painful , and accursed death of the Cross , and after so many hundred Sermons and offers of peace ; wilt thou now break with God for a base lust ? canst thou endure hereafter to lie among the Devils and damned in everlasting burnings ; and to see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of God ; and hear thy own conscience upbraiding thee to all eternity , that thou hast lost heaven , and dost lie in hell for loving thy cups , oaths , whores , or the dust of the earth , better than Jesus Christ ? OH Sirs , repent and believe quickly ; you have more need to do it , then either to eat , drink or sleep : for ought you know , you may be in hell before such another offer be made . I am sure there are million of diseases and deaths waiting at your doors to break up the treaty : I shall therefore conclude this in the words of Eliphaz to Job , cap. 22.21 , 22 , 23.  Acquaint now thyself with God , and be at peace ; thereby good shall come unto thee . 

Receive , I pray thee , the law from his mouth , and lay up his words in thy heart . 

If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up , thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy Tabernacles . 

Fourthly , prize and improve godly Ministers and people , whilst you have them , seeing it appears by this Doctrine , that you know not how soon they may be sent for to heaven , where I am sure they will be better respected . Now the greatest honour that you can show to godly Ministers , is , to be doers of the Word , which they are Preachers of . Ministers are more honoured by the conversion , though of the poorest servants , then by the highest commendations , which the most able and learned Doctors are able to express : for this is their greatest glory , to be instruments of God's glory in the salvation of poor souls ; for thereby the Word of God is glorified , 2 These . 3.1 . By the applause of men , Ministers may be cried up for persons of excellent gifts and parts ; but this is their greatest glory , when by the salvation of souls , the excellency of the power appears to be of God , and not of men . But Beloved , the ignorant unbelieving world knows not the worth of godly Ministers or Christians , because they see not the excellency of God , and Christ , and Holiness , and Heaven , which are the causes which make them so precious : The world knoweth us not , because it knew him not , 1 Joh. 3.1 . But whatever the men of the world think , who can prise nothing but honours , and riches , and pleasures , to which they should be dead and crucified ; I tell you , godly Ministers and Christians are the blessings of their age ; and those are the best Kingdoms , and Countries , and Towns , and Parishes , and Families , which have most of them , and which love them best . Solomon tells us , prov. 10.11 . The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life . I need not tell you what a necessary public mercy , a well of good and wholesome water is to the Town or Family where it spring's : Now a righteous man is a Well of Life ; he is a spring of spiritual Aqua vitae : Many a poor sinner , or sad swooning Christian , receives the spiritual life of grace , and strength , and comfort from the mouth of a godly Minister or Christian , prov. 15.4 . A wholesome tongue is a tree of life : it 's a Metaphor taken from the Tree of Life in Paradise , which was God's Ordinance to preserve man alive , had he continued in innocence . Thus a godly man is a tree of life in this evil world ; he turns a Family into a Paradise where he grows , and is prized : so that many a man who was dead in sin , and many a fainting child of God , is quickened and revived by feeding on the fruit of his wholesome tongue . 

Now my brethren , the serious consideration that these blessings are by sickness and death ready to be taken from us , should cause us to esteem and improve their spiritual and savoury company . How did Elisha cleave to Elijah , when he knew he was presently to be taken from him ! and therefore we find , that three times Elijah ( to try Elisha his constancy ) seemed to shake him off : but Elisha every time answers most solemnly , As the Lord liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee , 2 Kin. 2.2 , 3 , 6. and if you read the story , you will find that it proved well for Elisha , that he was so wise and careful to improve that precious opportunity . See Acts 20.25 . where Paul useth this Argument to press his following exhortation : And now behold , I know that you all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more . O people , honour your Ministers ; children , be instructed by your Parents whilst you have them ; for shortly you must see their faces no more . Christians , exhort one another daily , whilst it is called to day : For yet a little while , and you shall see one another's faces no more . We find that Saint Paul having exhorted Timothy to those great and necessary duties mentioned 2 Tim. 4.1 , 2 , 5. he presseth all with this melting motive , vers . 6.  For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand : as if he had said , My dear son Timothy , I am not like to counsel and instruct thee long ; therefore harken to the counsel of thy dying father Paul : Preach the word , be instant in season , out of season , etc.  Sirs , look upon your Ministers as dying Ministers , and your Friends as dying Friends ; and labour to draw from these wells of life whilst they live ; for you little know what a loss you will have of them when they die . 

Fifthly , believe and improve those precious Promises which God hath made for the preservation of your health and lives ; and in the use of means , live by faith and prayer upon those gracious promises . See prov. 3.1 , 2 , 7 , 8.  My son , forget not my law , but let thy heart keep my commandments . For length of days , and long life , and peace shall they add unto thee , verse . 7 , 8.  Fear the Lord , and depart from evil : It shall ‚óèe health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones . See also prov. 4.20 , 21 , 22.  Job 33.25 . His flesh shall be fresher than a child's , he shall return to the days of his youth . Hence we often see , that when a man's body is withered by sickness , and baked like a potsherd , he is restored by the blessing of God to such a good constitution and temper , that his body becomes fresh like the flesh of a child : This is elegantly expressed by David , Psal . 103.5 . Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things , so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles . Some say that the Eagles at every ten year's end cast off their old Feathers , and are quickly clothed again with new , as if they began to be young again , and so live till they be an hundred years old . 

Some also write of this property in the Eagles , that when by reason of old age , they have the upper part of their Bills bending down so far below the lower , that they are scarce able to feed , and so languish with hunger , that then they break their beaks upon a rock , whereby being able to feed , they grow to their former strength ; to which the translation in the singing Psalms seems to allude : Like as the Eagle casts her bill , 

Whereby her age renew'th . 

Whether these , and many other such relations of the wonderful properties of the Eagles be true , is uncertain ; yet it 's generally received , that they are Birds long-lived , and for many years continue so healthful , that they seem to grow young again . And thus God often blesseth men with health , and strength , and long life , that their strength is renewed like the Eagles : and although that which we read of Moses was extraordinary , that when he was an hundred and twenty years old , his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated ; yet we often see many live to a great age , with their health , and strength , and parts through God's mercy continued youthful and fresh to them . Now Sirs , lay up these promises in your hearts , and improve them by faith and prayer ; so they may be the better to you then the wholesomest diet , or best physic in the world . 

Lastly , use the means of health and life so , as that the God of life may bless you in the use of them : for this purpose , make conscience of these four things . 

First , Of your food : It is God that gives a blessing to this , Exod. 23.25 . He shall bless thy bread and thy water , and I will take away sickness from the midst of thee . Therefore pulse and water with God's blessing , made those conscientious Saints look and like better than others that were fed with royal dainties , Dan. 1.15 . Take then your food , as it were , out of the hands of God , who openeth his hand , and satisfieth the desire of every living thing , Psal . 145.16 . and eat , and drink , as those that see a presence of God at your table : Deut. 12.7 . ye shall eat before the Lord your God : eat as those that therein seek to please and honour God , Rom. 14.6 . He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , and giveth God thanks . I know these Scriptures intent particular occasions of eating ; yet they hold out upon the same reason our duty to eat and drink so , as to do the will of God , and to bring glory to him , according to that , 1 Cor. 10.31 . Whether ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God : as God turns all to a Christians good , so it 's the admirable property of grace to turn all to God's glory : A gracious heart can feed upon the goodness of God in , and bring glory to God out of every morsel of meat that comes into his mouth . Tertullian gives a very savoury relation of the Feasts of the primitive Christians : Before ( saith he ) they sit down to taste their meat , they first taste of prayer to God ; they eat so much as hunger requires , and drink no more than is profitable for chaste and sober persons ; they are so filled , as thereby fitted to worship God in the night ; they discourse at meat , as those that know that God hears them : and as they began , so they conclude the meal with prayer ; and so they departed , not as if they fed only upon meat , but also upon discipline and instruction . I refer the learned Reader to his own words , Apolog . cap. 39 here is a most gracious example , worthy of the imitation of all Christians . 

Secondly , make Conscience of your apparel ; let it be such as becomes a holy , chaste , humble member of Christ , and not a proud , vain , wanton limb of the Devil ; let your garments be both wholesome and comely ; neither so immodest as to dishonour the Gospel of Christ , nor sordid as to disgrace the Body of a Christian . 

Thirdly , make Conscience of lawful and seasonable recreations : These are healthful for our bodies , and when used in the fear , and according to the Will of God , do very much fit us for the most inward communion with him . What Solomon saith of one kind of labour , is true of others , that it is a weakness and weariness to the flesh , Eccles . 12.12 . For as it weakens a bow to keep it always bend , and mars the strings of an instrument to keep them always stretched ; so it weakens the body to keep it too long bend to one employment ; therefore it is God's will that it should be remitted to its harmless , inoffensive , and honest recreations . 

Lastly , make Conscience of the duties of your relations , so that you may refresh , and revive , and not disease and destroy one another ; our health and life doth much depend under God upon our relations . 

You therefore that are parents , do not spend your children's bread in whoredom , drunkenness , idleness and revenge : many parents find their lusts more chargeable than their children : It is very sad that children may cry out , We might have had better education , better trades , better portions better health , had not our merciless Parents loved their sins better than their children . 

You that are children , make not your parents life's miserable , who have been a means of life to you : be not such foolish children , as to be the heaviness of your parents , prov. 10.1 . 

Husbands , Nourish and cherish your own flesh , Eph. 5.29 . Make not provision for your lusts , with that which should make provision for your wives . 

Wives , do your Husband's good , and not evil , all the days of your lives , prov. 31.12 . labour to be their Comfort , and Crown , and not as rottenness in their bones . 

So much for the Exhortation to all in general . 

2.  Exhortation directed to people as they enjoy their health . 

The duty which I shall exhort unto , is to prepare for sickness and death . In this Exhortation I shall use this method . 

1.  I shall show what this work of preparation is . 

2.  I shall press this duty on several sorts of persons . 

3.  Urge it with some Motives . 

Lastly , I shall give several Directions to direct us how to be prepared for sickness and death . 

For the first . 

This work of preparation is that whereby every sound believer is by the spirit of Jesus Christ settled in such a blessed state and frame , that he is fitted for all that Christ shall do to him by sickness and death . 

In this description observe three things . 

1.  The principal efficient cause which makes this great preparation in us , viz. the Spirit of Jesus Christ . Hence Christ is called , The Author and finisher of our faith , Heb. 12.12 . Where Jesus Christ begins a work of grace and salvation in a soul , he never leaves it till he hath finished it , and made it up for heaven : therefore , saith the Apostle , Phil. 1.6 . Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you , will perform it , or finish it till the day of Jesus Christ ; that is , till the day of death , and of judgement : so that this is the great work of Jesus Christ in every true believer , to fit him , and make him ready for sickness , and death , and the day of judgement . 

2.  Here is the subject of this work , or the person prepared , viz. every true believer , who is a vessel of mercy prepared for glory . 

3.  Here is that wherein the nature of this work of preparation consists , viz. in three things . 

1.  He must be settled in the state of grace and salvation ; that is , he must have a Scripture-right to God , as he is the God of salvation by Jesus Christ , and so a right to heaven , and to all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace . 

2.  He must be wrought into a gracious frame , whereby he is bend to yield up himself in subjection and obedience to the will of God , in sickness , and in death . 

Lastly , Here is that which he must be prepared for , viz. all that God shall do to him by sickness and death : If God fill him with pain and misery , he hath his graces of faith , love , patience , humility , and meekness , to enable him to lie quietly , and obediently , and cheerfully under the power and will of his heavenly Father . If God call him by sickness into Eternity , he is with Saint Paul , ready to be offered ; and is made fit by grace , to receive and enjoy the glory of heaven . This gracious frame of heart is fully epxressed , Rom. 14.8 . Whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; or whether we die , we die unto the Lord ; that is , we live to this end , to please , and do the will , and to seek the glory of the Lord , and we are ready to die to the will and glory of the Lord  

So much for the Explication of this work of preparation . 

Secondly , I shall press this Exhortation upon these seven sorts of persons . 

1.  I shall exhort little children ( so far as they are capable to know and practise this duty ) to prepare for sickness and death . Now because this application may seem strange , consider , that God himself thinks it not below him to be a Teacher of young children , Psalms 148.12 , 13.  Both young men and maidens , old men and children , let them praise the name of the Lord And all parents are commanded to teach their children to know and do his will , Deut. 6.6 , 7.  And these words which I command thee this day , shall be in thy heart ; and thou shalt teach them diligently ; ( or wh‚óèt and sharpen them ) upon thy children . So prov. 22.6 . Train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old , he will not depart from it . Observe , there is a way for young children to go to heaven , and it is that wherein they should be found when they are old ; and all parents are bound to set them in that way : and indeed ; children are sooner capable than av-s_d conceive , to know something of God , and Christ , and Heaven , and Hell. Timothy knew the Scriptures , „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ , from a sucking child , 2 Tim. 3.15 . And this appears by the timely fruits of the Spirit that sometimes drop from their pretty sanctified mouths . 

And certainly baptised children being Christ's Disciples , and admitted into his School , the Church , have a right to be taught in the way to salvation ; and Christ is a Prophet to them , and his Ministers are Ministers to them , as well as to others : And really , Ministers have often more comfort from catechised Boys and Girls , then from many old ignorant Atheists , who are worse than children in the understanding of the Scriptures . And lastly , it makes much for God's glory , to have his Name praised by the mouths of little children , Psal . 8.2 . Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength , because of thy enemies , that thou mightest still the enemy and avenger . Observe , God hath ordained that his praise in the mouths of little children , shall be a strong and powerful means to stop the mouths of malicious subtle Atheists , to still the enemy and avenger . So we read , Matth. 21.16 . Out o‚óè the mouths of babes and sucklings hast tho‚óè perfected praise . The praises that come to God by the blessed Angels , and all the Saints in heaven and earth , is perfected and made up by the praises of these young Saints . Now considering these things , and seeing sickness and death fetch away so many young children into Eternity , I have chosen to direct one brief Exhortation to the young Boys and Girls among us . 

O come therefore , you sweet and pretty children , and I will teach you the fear of the Lord : be you prepared for sickness and death . Hark , sweet Children , you were born children of the Devil , and you must be born again if ever you will be the children of God.  

Good children , know and love the God that made you , and Jesus Christ who died for you , to redeem and save you . 

You can be afraid of the Rod , and a Bugbear ; be afraid of sin and hell . 

Perhaps you have godly parents , who instruct and catechise you in the knowledge of God : Why , good children , hear the instruction of your fathers , and forsake not the law of your mothers . God doth not love you as his children , because you are pretty or witty children , or because you are the children of rich parents ; but if you will love and fear the Lord , than you shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation . 

Good children , look on the graves in the Churchyards , and you shall see many who were no elder nor taller than you , dead and buried before you : as young as you are sick , and as young as you are dead , and as young as you are in heaven and hell ; therefore be Gods children whilst you are young , lest you be sick , and dead , and damned before you be old . 

2.  Exhort parents to do their duty in endeavouring to prepare their children for sickness and death , Ephes . 6.4 . „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ , feed or nourish your children in the fear of the Lord Beasts can take care to save their young ones lives ; but men , and women , and Christians should be careful to save their children's souls : when thy children die , if thou hast neglected their salvation , it must ( if thy conscience be ever awakened ) cause stinging reflections in thy soul . There is a story of a father , who consented that his daughter should commit whoredom ; which she did , and soon after died ‚ñ™ whereupon the poor guilty father cries out , I have damned my daughter's soul , I have damned my daughter's soul . Sirs , do not teach your children to to lie , swear , to be drunk or covetous , to scoff at God's children or holiness , lest one day you have cause to cry out when it is too late , We have damned our children's souls . When your hearts are affected to see your children about you , then see diseases and death at your doors , ready to make your children orphans , or you childless ; and consider withal , how sad it is , that such pretty sweet children should be for ever burned in hell . Beloved , I would not have you worse than Infidels , in not providing for your children's bodies ; and yet I would have you better than Devils , in providing for their poor souls : It is a pleasant sight to see parents live , as if they were going with all their children to heaven : It is comely to see parents sitting in their house , and their children about them ; or to see them sitting in a Congregation , and their children about them : but how much more glorious will it be , to see them sitting in heaven , and their children about them ! though the relation will end , yet the comfort of being a means to bring them thither will abide for ever . Parents , if you cannot make your children heirs of houses and lands , labour to make them heirs of heaven ; do not only teach your children how to live , but also teach them how to die : thou art troubled sometimes to think , Alas , how will my poor children live ! I tell thee thou hast more need to think , How will my poor children die ! for there are few so poor , but they can make some shift to live ; but there are million so miserable , that they know not how to die . 

3.  Exhortation to young men . Unto you , OH men , I call , and my voice is unto the sons of men , prov. 8.4 . make it your care to prepare for sickness and death . Solomon having taught , that childhood and youth is vanity , Eccles . 11.10 . he infers this Exhortation to young men , Eccles . 12.1 . Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth . It is necessary for all young people to live , as those that know , that God will bring them to judgement , Eccles . 11.9 . Consider , you are never prepared for sickness and death , till you are prepared for judgement . O young men and women , look upon yourselves as going to judgement : Hark , do not you hear the great shout that calls you all to make your appearance before the judgment-seat of Christ . Sirs , be nothing now , but what you would appear to be at that great day : Wouldst thou be judged as a Drunkard , or Swearer , or Whoremonger , or Worldling , or as an enemy to godly Ministers and Christians at the day of judgement ? If not , then be not such a one now ; do not think yourselves too young to enter into a serious way of godliness : For what if sickness and death will not stay till you are old ? thou art not too young to be sick , or to die : Do not then think that thou art too young to go to heaven , lest God think thee old enough to go to hell . 

4.  Exhortation to old men to prepare for sickness and death : The days which Solomon calls evil days , are already come upon you . Methinks I may allude to that of our Saviour , Joh. 4.35 . Look on the fields , for they are white already unto Harvest . When I look on old people , I see a white crop of grey hairs , which speaks them to be ripe for the sickle of death . Sirs , diseases and death have done a great deal of their work upon you already ; they have worn away your colour , beauty and strength : yet how sad is it to see an old man more unfit to die , than a very child that begins to live ! He is old and ignorant , old and covetous , old and malicious , old and cruel , old , and yet a drunkard . O poor man , what hast thou been doing all thy days ? Hast thou had fifty , threescore , almost fourscore years , to prepare for sickness and death , and to lay up treasures in heaven ; and hast thou done nothing else , but been heaping up wrath in hell ! Hark , old Father ( for I must needs honour thy hoary head ) the sickbed , death , the grave call for thee : O then repent , and believe presently ; let not the Devil , who long ago persuaded thee thou wast too young , now persuade thee thou art too old ; for as old as thou art , yet it is better for thee to go to heaven a young Babe of Christ , then to go to hell an old slave of the Devil . 

5.  Exhortation to rich and great men of the world to prepare for sickness and death . Sirs , there are messengers at your doors to fetch you , where mountains of gold are worth nothing ; your riches cannot guard you against sickness and death : God can as easily turn a Bed of Down into a Bed of Languishing , as a Bed of Straw ; and a disease cares no more for the richest Velvet , than the poorest Sheep skin ; and a sickness can as easily catch thee in a Coach , as in a Cart ; and death enters into the stateliest Castle , assoon as the poorest cottage . Read your case , Jam. 1.10 , 11.  As the flower of the grass he shall pass away : For the Sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perishes ; so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways . O tell thy friends , lands , silver and gold , that thou art going into Eternity , and art presently to stand before the Judge of Quick and Dead , and see what help they can afford thee : thou wilt certainly find Solomon's words true , prov. 11.4 . riches profit not in the day of wrath . 

Beloved , If we would know whether a man be happy or miserable , we must not look upon him as he appears in his honours and riches , etc. but follow him to his death , and the day of judgement ; see how he speeds there , and how he comes off then , for then the man comes to his proof : and we shall see , that all the riches of the world yield no profit in those great days , but then the highest carnal Monarch shall be no more respected by the Judge of all the world , than the ugliest Devil of Hell ; when a poor godly servant , or day-labourer , shall be crowned with incorruptible glory before his face . O therefore you rich men , look among all your jewels and treasures , whether you have a God , and Christ , and grace for your poor souls ; these only are the provision which will maintain you against the terrors of death , and the dread of judgement . 

6.  Exhortation to poor men to prepare for sickness and death . We think them poor who have nothing to live on in this world ; but they are poor , who have nothing to live on in the other world . Poor people ! you cannot come at the silver , and gold , and riches of this world , when you will ; but you have as much freedom to the riches of the other world , as the mightiest Prince upon earth . thou mayst call God Father , and ask what thou wilt , and live upon the everlasting Kingdom of heaven as thy own : and therefore you that are poor and godly , let your riches of the other world comfort you against the poverty of this : Look on thy cold Cottage , and then look on thy house not made wi‚óèh hands : Look on thy poor leathern clotheses , and then look how thou shalt be clothed when thou appearest with Christ in glory : Look on thy brown bread , and course fare , and then remember the entertainment which Angels and Saints have in heaven . O poor people ! though you know not how to be maintained whilst you live , yet get saving grace , and you will be rich enough to go to heaven when you die . 

The last Exhortation shall be to such , who , in some respects , seem nearer death than other persons . I shall instance only in three sorts of people , to whom I shall direct this Exhortation to prepare for sickness and death . 

First , Such whose callings and employments do expose their lives to daily and great dangers ; as Watermens , Colliers , Carpenters , Masons , etc.  These men , by a leak in a Boat or Ship , a fall of a little earth , a slip of a foot , may be turned to heaven or hell every day : Yet we often see , that many who live in the greatest dangers , live in the greatest sins . My earnest advice to you is , to prepare for death , that though you stand in dangerous places , yet you may stand upon sure ground for the salvation of your souls . Sirs , for aught I know , you may get heaven with lesle danger than you get your livings : Remember what precious souls you have , and that every time you venture your lives , you venture your souls too : Labour by sound repentance to forsake your sins , and to turn to God. Do not swear , and lie , and be drunk , and deceive others : Do not profane the Lords days , if you expect that God should preserve you on working days ; labour by a sound faith to rest on Christ to save your guilty souls ; see your nearness unto Eternity ; be often looking from the places where you are , into heaven and hell , and see what a little there is betwixt you and them ; and seriously consider , if now you should fall into Eternity , in which of those two places would be your portion : Get such a saving knowledge of God , that you may comfortably commit the keeping of your lives unto him , and solemnly worship God in your Closets and Families , and live in the fear of God , and in peace with him , and use your callings to his glory , that he may preserve you in your ways ; or however , that if you do die in your callings , you may not die in your sins . 

Secondly , Such , who though they have ordinarily present case and health , yet they are subject to dangerous and sudden pains , and fearful distempers , as Convulsions , Falling-sickness , Stone , etc. you have need , in regard of these , to be always prepared for sickness and death : you would not be without what remedies you can get , when your distempers come : O do not be without God , and Christ , and Grace , if death should come in them . Whatever you are doing , consider , Now my distempers may surprise me ; therefore if they take you in bed , at meat , at work , let them not take you in your sins : in all likelihood , these fits will shorten your days ; therefore let them hasten your repentance : these distempers will fill you with torturing pains , or for present deprive you of your reason , parts , senses , etc. so that then will be a very unfit time to prepare for death ; therefore improve your times of health and ease , as merciful opportunities , that when your diseases or death find you , they may not find you unprovided . Sirs , always remember , that you carry death in your bodies ; therefore be sure to carry grace in your souls . 

Lastly , Women that are with child , have special reason to be prepared for sickness and death : God hath inseparably fixed this punishment upon this Sex , that in sorrow they shall bring forth children , Gen. 3.16 . And our Saviour tells us , Joh. 16.21 . A woman when she is in travail , hath sorrow : And experience witnesseth the grievous pangs and pains of all , and the sad deaths of very many in this condition : so that thou must certainly within a few weeks be grievously diseased , and thou mayst probably die : do not then venture into such dangers in a Christless state . Poor woman ! perhaps thou hast bred that life which will be thy own death : therefore labour to find that Christ is as sure form in thy heart , as the babe is form in thy womb ; and before that sad and dangerous hour of the birth of thy child come , examine thoroughly whether the new birth be passed in thy soul : I would not have thee oppress thy heart with the dismal fore-thoughts and distracting fears of that time : for to be sure , sufficient to that day will be the evil thereof ; but I would have thee so prepared , that the short pangs of child-bearing may not end in the everlasting pangs and torments of hell ; and that thou mayst be a new creature , and found in the righteousness of Jesus Christ , that if thou shouldst no longer live with thy Husband , nor enjoy the fruit of thy womb upon earth , thou mayst live with Christ , and enjoy the fruit of his righteousness in heaven for ever . I shall conclude this with that suitable Scripture , 1 Tim. 2.5 . Notwithstanding she shall be saved in child-bearing , if they continue in faith , and charity , and holiness with sobriety : lest poor women should be swallowed up with the sad thoughts of the sin mentioned in the former verse , where it 's said that Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the gransgression : for which sin , disgrace and punishment is fixed to the Sex : these words are added for their comfort , to show that , notwithstanding that sin and the punishment thereof , yet they shall be saved in child-bearing , if they continue in faith , and charity , and holiness with sobriety . Poor woman ! methinks I see thee walking with two souls over eternity , and both full of sin ; O therefore hasten to make thy peace with that God whose power alone must take the child out of the mother's bowels ; that so thou mayst comfortably depend and call upon him to save both your lives , but however to save your poor souls . 

I come now to urge this duty with these seven Motives . 

Mot. 1.  It is the will of God that you should be prepared for sickness and death ; in so doing , you do the will of God ; he commands you to wait , and watch , and prepare for the day of judgement , Matth. 24.42 . Mar. 13.33 , 35.  Now it 's a certain rule , that all those Scriptures which command us to prepare for the day of judgement , do imply our duty to be prepared for sickness and death , which are the forerunners of that day ; and the same preparation which is made for the one , will serve for the other . Now , my brethren , this is a sufficient reason to move you to this duty : for it 's the will of God which makes it our duty , and binds us to it , and must be the reason to us why we do it , or we can never be prepared aright . Beloved , God would have us to be saved , 1 Tim. 2.4 . to reign with him in heaven ; and therefore to be always ready against the time that he sends for us thither . 

Mot. 2.  it 's a sign of a very wise man to be prepared for sickness and death , prov. 22.3 . A prudent man forseeth the evil , and hideth himself . A wise godly man sees sickness , and death , and the day of judgement before him : he knows he must go through all these , and therefore he takes care to provide so as to be safe and happy in those great dangers . Beloved , it 's the greatest wisdom in the world , to be wise to salvation : it 's better miscarry in a thousand businesses then in the business of Salvation : Now he that is wise to salvation , prepares against all the dangers that he must be saved from ; and the greatest danger is at death , when a man must go through that door where so many million fall into hell : what a wise man than is he who is prepared so , as that door to him is the door of heaven ! Many that get estates and preferments in the world , are much admired for their wisdom ; and yet when death comes , they must be damned for their folly ! Remember the Parable of the ten Virgins , five whereof were wise , and five were foolish : Now why were those five called wise ? the reason was , because when that great cry was made at midnight , Behold , the Bridegroom cometh , they were prepared : and why were the other five foolish ? because they were unprepared for that great time . Beloved , when the great God our Saviour shall come out of heaven with his mighty Angels , and his glorious Saints , and shall show his blessed face in the clouds , and sound a trumpet that will call all the quick and dead before him in the twinkling of an eye ; certainly they will prove the wisest persons , that are so prepared as to stand , and triumph , and lift up their heads with joy in that great appearance . Ah Sirs , when Come ye blessed , and Go ye cursed , hath distinguished and parted the world , it will then be known , who are wise men , and who are fools . 

Mot. 3.  Because it 's altogether uncertain when sickness and death will come , the Scripture useth this argument , Mar. 13.33 . Watch and pray : for ye know not when your time is . Solomon elegantly sets forth the uncertainty of our time , Eccles . 9.12 . For man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the snare , so are the sons of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them . As the fishes are sporting in the water , and are presently mashed in the net ; and as the birds are hopping in the chaff , and are presently caught in the snare ; so poor man is suddenly and unexpectedly surprised in the snares of death . Sometimes a man is fast asleep , and sickness awakens him : sometimes he is feeding at the table , and death comes between the cup and the lip : sometimes he is riding a journey , and death throws him into eternity : and sometimes he is making a purchase , and death comes and breaks the bargain : sometimes he is marrying a wife , and death comes and mars the match . Sirs , sickness and death are under no rules of civility ; they care not for disturbing the weightiest business in the world : if therefore we cannot say of any thing , I will do this , or I will have that , before I am sick or dead ; certainly our very next work should be to prepare for sickness and death . 

Mot. 4.  Because thou knowest not what kind of sickness or death may come upon thee . We read of a great death , 2 Cor. 1.10 . Sometimes death comes with great pains , and great terrors , and great temptations , which make it a great death ; so that the provision of a whole age of grace will not , without the mighty support of God's Spirit , keep thee holy and cheerful at such a time . It is said , Job 18.13 . The firstborn of death shall devour his strength . The firstborn is the chiefest and mightiest in its kind ; and therefore the meaning is , that death shall come in the most cruel and terrible manner to devour a man : Now set before thee those that have died in the most fearful pains of body , and have been assaulted with the most horrid temptations , and consider , this may be thy case ; however , prepare against the worst , that Sin , and Death , and Devils , and men can do against thee . 

Mot. 5.  By thy being prepared for sickness and death , thou art also prepared for health and life ; for there is none so fit to live , as he who is fit to die ; the same graces which will make thee holy , and patient , and joyful in sickness , will make thee so in health ; for the same faith , love , humility , meekness and patience , which qualify the soul for passive obedience , do also fit the soul for active obedience ; as the same provision of victuals or money which is made against a siege or famine , will be useful and profitable , if such times do not happen : so that you can neither be well , nor sick , nor live , nor die without this work of preparation . 

Mot. 6.  That man is in a most blessed condition , who is prepared for sickness and death ; for every thing which makes him prepared , makes him blessed . I shall only instance in two things . 

1.  All the happiness of the other world is his own , 1 Cor. 3.22 . Things to come are yours . Christians , your sins , snares and troubles are almost past , but they will be all over shortly ; but your joy , glory and happiness are to come : The happiness of heaven is to come , and the glory of the day of judgement is to come : Now all these joys that are to come , are yours ; for they are settled upon you in the Covenant of Grace , 1 Tim. 4.8 . Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come . Now that man is fit to die , and is in a most blessed condition , who when sickness and death comes , hath a right to go to heaven . Poor child of God the best of thy hopes , and comforts , and happiness , lies beyond death , and thou canst not come at them for this life ; but sickness and death will put thee into possession of all , and thou art like to see a strange sight , so soon as death hath loosed thee out of this life . 

2.  He is by the graces of God's Spirit fitted for heaven ; he is made meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the Saints in light , Col. 1.12 . Beloved , grace makes a man fit to receive glory ; the joys of heaven are brought and received into the soul by grace ; if thou wilt be prepared for death , live now as thou hopest to live for ever in heaven ; do nothing but what thou wouldst do going to heaven . Besides , by grace the heart of a Believer fastens on heaven ; he lays hold on eternal life ; he prays , hears and receives Sacraments with his heart , having fast hold on heaven . How fit therefore is such a man to have sickness and death come to let him into heaven ! 

Last Motive . If you are not prepared for sickness and death , you will be prepared for hell . Sirs , if a godly man doth good , and a sinner doth evil , both go into eternity ; the one to be a treasure in heaven , the other to be a treasure in hell . Now what a fearful condition is this , for a man to be always laying up provision against himself in hell ! We read , Rom. 9.22 . of vessels of wrath fitted or made up for destruction ; if you will not be made up for heaven , you must be made up for hell : O believe what a fearful condition this is , to be always ready to be turned into hell ; thou dost not think of this whilst the pleasures of sin and the patience of God last : But what a case wilt thou be in , when there will be nothing in thee but torments , and nothing in God towards thee but wrath ! Beloved , be convinced of the certainty of hell ; thou mayst as certainly see hell by the light of Scripture , as thou mayst see men , and beasts , and earth , and trees by the light of the Sun ; hell is as certain as sin and sinners ; there is wrath in God as sure as there is sin in man God's justice is as sure as his mercy ; and he hath bound himself to condemn unbelievers , as well as to save believers . See Joh. 3. ult . Mark 16.16 . 

See your nearness to hell , whilst you are unprepared for sickness and death : methinks I see that every step thou goest , thou art ready to tread in the flames . Poor soul ! thou hangest over the lake of brimstone by the twined thread of life ; when that breaks , thou art drowned and damned for ever ; there is nothing appears between thee and hell , but the hand-breadth of time : O what a sight is this , to see a company of secure sinners drinking , and swearing , and swaggering , and ranting , and roaring within an hand-breadth of everlasting burnings ! Again , consider the greatness of hell-torments ; here is a depth that thou canst not fathom ; who can speak of the greatness of hell-torments , when it 's our duty to believe they are unspeakable ? Canst thou tell how many year's eternity lasts ? or how much punishment sin deserves ? Dost thou know how much wrath Omnipotency can inflict ? or how much torment a vessel of wrath can hold ? then mayst thou measure the torments of hell , and fathom the lake of fire and brimstone . Consider but this one thing , viz. the greatness of God who inflicts the torments ; he is a God to whom vengeance belongs , and he were no God if he could not do that which belongs to him : consider God is great in every thing that he is ; to whom he is a father , a portion , a husband , he is a great father , a great portion , a great husband ; to whom he is an enemy , he is a great enemy : O how great must their misery be , who must for ever feel the weight of that hand which made heaven and earth ! Beloved , if but the ache of a tooth be so grievous , that it takes away the taste of a whole monarchy of the world while it lasts ; how inconceiveably great must their torments be , who have the power that made all the world set a-work to torment their bodies and souls through all eternity ! Nay , consider further , God will raise up his glory out of his enemy's misery ; those are always great works which God makes to please himself , and to demonstrate his glory : when he would glorify his power , and goodness , and wisdom , he makes a world ; when he would glorify his grace , and love , and mercy , he gives a Christ ; and when he would glorify his justice and holiness , he damns a sinner . OH woe , wo , wo be those poor souls , out of whose torments God will raise up to himself an everlasting revenue of unspeakable glory ! O than what a miserable cheated soul art thou , who wilt venture to be one hour unprepared for sickness and death , when for aught thou knowest thou mayst be in the bottom of hell before the clock strike next ! 

I shall now in the last place conclude this Use , by giving you ten Directions to direct you how to prepare for sickness and death . 

Direct . 1.  Labour by a strong and lively faith to be always receiving and resting upon the righteousness of Jesus Christ . Beloved , the greatest danger you are to provide against , is , that sickness and death do not bring you to hell : Now being found in Christ's righteousness , you shall have thereby a safe and comfortable way and passage through these into heaven ; for by reason of this , you may stand on the very gates of death , and triumph with the Apostle , Rom. 8.33 , 34.  Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect ? It is God that justifieth ; who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us . Now this righteousness of Christ is as truly thine by faith , as it is Paul's , or ever a Saints in heaven , Rom. 3.22 . The righteousness of God is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all , and upon all them that believe ; for there is no difference . So that I say thou mayst stand in this righteousness , and put all the enemies of thy salvation to the trial , and ask , Who can lay any thing to thy charge ? or condemn thee ? And thou mayst in effect hear from all the like answer , which was made by other things in Job in another case : Sin saith , It is not in me ; and Satan saith , It is not in me ; and the Law saith , It is not in me ; and Death saith , It is not in me ; we have nothing to charge upon a justified person : and therefore be always taking new and fresh hold in this righteousness ; for it is observable , that God doth not only in a set and solemn way , as in Sacraments , and Sermons , etc. offer and give Jesus Christ ; but also he is constantly offering him in the Gospel , and declaring it to be his will that we should take him : and thou shouldst not only in the duties of God's worship , but also upon all opportunities in secret , and at other times , be applying to thyself , and owning and glorying in this righteousness of Jesus Christ ; believe that God is always smelling a sweet savour in this righteousness , as offered for thee , and that Christ is by his continual intercession presenting it to his Father for thee , and it 's always offered in the Gospel to thee ; do thou therefore always take it for thy righteousness to justify thee , that when sickness and death come , thou mayst be found so doing . 

Direct . 2.  Learn to die daily ; for it is a certain truth , that he that will live when he dies , must die whilst he life's : and therefore Paul affirms it to be his practice , 1 Cor. 15.31 . I protest by your rejoicing that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily . 

But how can a man die daily ? 

Answ . Three ways . 

1.  By a daily separating and losing his heart from all things , which death can lose him and separate him from : I mean so as not to accounted his life and happiness to consist in them ‚ñ™ death you know is a separation from that which is our life . Now we have a kind of life in husbands , wives , children , estates , etc. and when death comes , it separates us from these ; therefore I say we die daily by a daily loosening and parting the heart from them ; this duty is clearly taught by the Apostle , 1 Cor. 7.29 , 30 , 31. where the Apostle exhorts , that because our time to enjoy relations , pleasures and estates is but short , and we are presently to spend an eternity without them , therefore let them that have wives be as though they had none , and they that rejoice be as though they rejoiced not , and they that buy be as though they possessed not ; that is , they must live with their hearts loosed and parted from these things : for as a traveller useth the necessary accommodations of his Inn soberly , seasonably and cheerfully whilst he stays , yet so as to forward , and not to hinder his journey home : So a Christian must use the comforts of this life holily , cheerfully and thankfully , yet so as not to stop him in his way to heaven : Our sweetest enjoyments must neither make the thoughts of eternity lesle sweet , nor our passage into eternity more hard . Now hereby a man is very much prepared for sickness and death ; for one thing which makes these so grievous , is , because the heart hath taken such hold of the creature , that it exceedingly torment's him to be broken from it ; so that it is often a greater trouble to lose his soul from the world , then to lose it from the body : but when by grace the heart is already loosed from the world , a great part of death's work is done already , because death finds him dead to the world when it comes to take him out of the world . 

2.  A man dies daily , by a daily living on those things which he must live upon after death . We are commanded this duty , Col. 3.1 , 2.  If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above , and not on things on the earth : As the heart must be parted from the things on earth , so it must be set , and fixed , and fastened on the things in heaven : and this is the property of grace , to make the heart dead to the world , by turning it to a life in God , and Christ , and heaven . Now this also is a dying daily , for death to a child of God is a removing him from a life on earth , to a life in heaven ; and hereby he doth , as it were , go beyond death , and hath his life , and joy , and comfort in the other world : He walks by faith in the streets of the City that hath foundations , and rests and refresheth his soul in his house not made with hands ; he secretly departs from the company and comforts of this life , and gets his heart among Angels and Saints in heaven , beholding , and praising , and rejoicing in the face of God and Jesus Christ . Now such a man must needs be fit to die , because his heart is set on every thing that death brings him unto : Like Paul , who having his heart fixed on Christ in heaven , cries out , Phil. 1.23 . I desire to be dissolved , and to be with Christ . 

Lastly , a man dies daily , by daily looking upon himself as a dying or dead man : he lays death to his heart , Eccles . 7.2 . his heart is full of the serious thoughts of death , Job 17.13 , 14.  If I wait , the grave is my house ; I have made my bed in the darkness . I have said to corruption , thou art my father ; to the worm , thou art my mother and my sister . Ah sirs , to one that knows he shall die and sleep in Jesus , death and the worms are as sweet as his dearest relations . And thus a man prepares for death , when he doth , as it were , accustom himself to die , and makes death familiar to him . Christians , look upon yourselves , as always at the very point of death ; when you are putting your flowers in your bosoms , remember you are , as it were , dressing a Corpse for the grave ; when you are washing and kembing your heads and faces , and looking on them in the glass , remember what ghastly skulls they will be shortly ; yet let thy thoughts be often among the graves ; think , here lies my Grandfather and Grandmother ; there lies my Father and Mother ; yonder lies my Brother and Sister ; and I myself am just going to lie down amongst them . Thus learn to die daily . 

Direct . 3.  Labour by an eye of faith to discern between things that differ . Beloved , faith hath a very deep and piercing insight into things ; it judgeth of things by Scripture , it believes what God in his Word speaks of them ; and so a believers carriage towards every thing is according as the Word describes and presents it to him : and surely this makes people so unprepared to die , because they want an understanding of things : It cannot sink into their hearts , that sin is so bad , and Christ so good ; or the world so vain , or grace so precious ; or hell so terrible , or heaven so glorious : but they are so confident that lust is sweet , and riches are precious , and death is far off , and hell is but a bug bear , and heaven is but a fancy : And in this confidence they will live and die ; and therefore the Apostle prays that the Philippians may try things that differ , that they may be fit for the day of Christ . I shall therefore give you this Direction in these following particulars . 

1.  Look upon God and the world together , and you shall see the difference ; for this end I beseech you search and believe that Scripture , Isa . 40.15 , 17.  Behold , the nations are as a drop of a bucket , and are counted as the small dust of the balance . Behold , he taketh up the isles as a very little thing . All nations before him are as nothing , and they are counted to him lesle than nothing and vanity . Now let thy heart judge of , and act towards God and the world , according to this difference : Set all the world before thee , give every creature its due ; see what a vast world of Kingdoms and Nations it is ; look upon the strong Islands which are fortified and moted about with the Seas , which this great God takes up as a very little thing ; see a world of great and mighty men before thee ; see the rich world of gold , and silver , and precious stones , lying on heaps before thee ; look upon the lands and buildings which make all the woods , fields , pastures , meadows , orchards , vineyards , gardens , towns , cities and stately houses in the world . OH what a glorious world is this , which made the very Angels shout for joy at the rearing of it ! Well , take a full survey of the glory and beauty of this great world : and then looking on a drop of water hanging on a bucket , what a poor thing is this ? which is ready to break , and fall on the ground , and no body catcheth at it : look also upon the small dust of the balance , a thing of neither weight nor worth , it doth not so much as turn the scales : Now labour by faith to have such a clear insight into the greatness and goodness of God and Jesus Christ , that thou mayst be able to judge all the world to be but as a drop of the bucket , or as the small dust of the balance , to thy Father and Saviour ; and let thy whole man act according to such a wise , holy , just judgement : and this will exceedingly fit thee for sickness and death , which come to lose thee from such a vain world , into the presence and everlasting enjoyment of such a glorious God.  

2.  Look upon sin , and upon the righteousness of Jesus Christ ; look upon these together Beloved , faith hath a deep insight into the evil of sin , for it sees the glory of God , which sin is against , wherein the evil of it appears , and believes the dreadful curses of the law , and what the wrath of God , and what hell is , and what an immortal being a man is that must suffer these . Faith also hath a piercing insight into the excellency of Christ's righteousness ; it sees what an infinitely-glorious God Jesus Christ is , which makes his righteousness so precious and meritorious , and so savoury and satisfactory to the Father ; and for this reason , so all-sufficient for faith to rest and live upon : for this is the precious property of justifying faith , that it receives Christ's righteousness for salvation , for the same reason which God receives it for satisfaction ; that is , because it is the righteousness of God ; and indeed , faith must see God satisfied , before it can see the believer saved : and seeing enough in Christ for the satisfaction of God , it sees the same sufficiency in him for the salvation of the Believer . Now Christ's righteousness never appears more precious than when the soul is filled with the deepest sight and sense of sin ; for then the soul believes him to be a great Saviour , when he sees the great evil of sin which he saves him from : and therefore it is observable , that the Apostle demonstrates the direful guilt and filth of sin , as a preface to that great Doctrine of Justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ , Rom. 3. from vers . 9 to the end of that Chapter . 

And as you know , it was a sad and fearful case for the poor Jews to be bitte‚óè with the fiery Serpents , and to lie groaning under the pain and anguish of those poisonous and deadly wounds : yet than what a glorious sight was it to look upon the brazen Serpent , and thereby to find power and virtue to heal them presently ? 

So , my brethren , it is a fearful case in itself , for a man to stand in the very jaws of death , and to look into the horrid nature of sin , and see death , and devils , and hell , and all the curses of the law ready to flee in his face : and yet how glorious is it then to look upon the righteousness of Jesus Christ and see them all swallowed up , and himself saved ? And thus as he sees the grace of God in Christ reigning and over-abounding all sin , Rom. 5.20 , 21. so his faith , and hope , and joy grounded thereon , doth rise above , and over-abound and swallow up all his fears of death and hell which he was in because of his sins . 

3.  Look upon all your sufferings on earth , and upon the glory of heaven together . The Apostle tells us , Act. 14.22 . We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Observe , there is an entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven out of all our afflictions , and our way to heaven lies through much tribulation : an hypocrite seems to go strongly in the way to heaven , but oftentimes when he comes to trouble , persecution , etc. there he is stopped , and can go no farther ; but he that believes the goodness of duty , and the glory of heaven , if tribulation , sickness , poverty , persecution seek to stop him , he goes through them ; he knows duty is sweet and safe , and therefore he will follow it , till it bring him to heaven , whatever it cost him . Tertullian comforts the Martyrs in prison with this , That in their close and dark prisons they might see illam viam , quae ad Deum ducit , that way which leads them to God : There is a way to heaven out of prison , sickbed , or any other affliction . Hence those that come to heaven , are said to come out of great tribulation , rev. 7.14 . Sometimes a poor Saint comes hot , as it were , out of the furnace of affliction into heaven ; from chains and bolts in a prison , he is loosed into heaven ; from gasping and groaning upon a sickbed , to heaven : surely when he comes there , he finds a strange alteration . Well , look upon thyself now as standing between the two worlds : a world of sin , snares , persecution , poverty , sickness and death on the one hand ; and a world of life , and immortality , and fullness of inconceivable joy and pleasure on the other hand . Thus the Apostle seems to stand , 2 Cor. 4.17 , 18. we stand looking from our afflictions , on the things that are not seen . So Rome 8.17 , 18.  If we suffer with him , we shall be glorified with him . Well , put these together ; put the persecution from wicked men , and the Crown of Glory together ; put a moment of pain and misery on a sick bed , and an eternity of joy in heaven together ; and thou must needs conclude with the Apostle , vers . 18.  For I reckon ( saith he ) I have cast them both up , and I find , that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us . 

Lastly , look upon time and eternity together . O what is time , when a man looks into eternity ! it seems but a breath , a twinkling of an eye , a stroke of a pulse , to a man that sees eternity before him . Methinks a believer is like a man on a hill by the seaside : he sees a little spot of ground , and the great Ocean lying beyond it ; so he sees a little spot of time , and the great Ocean of eternity lying beyond it : he sees the end of all things : O , saith he , I am gone , I am gone : look how all the honours , and riches , and comforts of this life do vanish out of my sight ; and everlasting fire , or everlasting glory will receive me presently ! Sirs , this would make us live in a posture to die , if we did but see what a little while it is before we must sit with Christ in heaven , or burn with Devils in hell . 

Direct . 4.  Labour to fill up your time : this is the way to fit you for eternity : but you will say , What is it to fill up our time ? 

Answ . Time is filled by applying our time to that work which God hath given us our time for : God hath given us time for our callings , to labour and do all that we have to do ; time to worship God , and do his will ; time for recreations , meat , drink , sleep , etc. and by all these , to honour God , to be blessings to men , and to seek salvation for ourselves : and by doing these things , we fill our time : as for example , if a man should write down his days work , ( not that I would impose upon the consciences of men ) So long I was slugging in bed , so long I was glutting at meat , so long filling myself with drink , at such a time belching out oaths ; and then look upon this on a sickbed , here would be a black day to look upon , such a day would make work in eternity . So if a man spend a day in idleness , as Seneca speaks of some idle persons , that are busied between the comb and the looking-glass ; now if such a one were to write his days work , he must leave a blank for such a day , which would cause stinging reflections when he comes to know the loss of his precious time : But if a godly man should write down , Such an hour I spent in secret prayer and meditation , such an hour in family-worship , such a time in the works of my calling , and such time in a sober use of recreations ; now if this were done in a right manner , notwithstanding many invincible infirmities , yet here is a day well filled , and may cause sweet reflections , when he sees his days ending in eternity . Now that you may thus improve , and fill up your time , I shall briefly give you these five Directions . 

1.  Labour to have your hearts filled with grace . Beloved , a man's time is full of that which his heart is full of ; the heart fills the tongue , and fills the life , and so fills the time . Solomon tells us , prov. 10.20 . The heart of the wicked is little worth : when all that is in a man's heart is good for nothing , neither good to honour God , nor to save himself , nor others , than his time must needs be good for nothing ; it must needs be an empty , sinful , unprofitable time ; for such a man hath nothing to fill up his time with . But on the contrary , our Saviour tells us , Matth. 12.35 . A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things : The graces of God's Spirit make a good treasure in the heart ; and all things that come from faith , love , humility , meekness , etc. are good things , and do much good : and a man's time is happily filled , that is full of prayer , of holiness , of godly conference , etc. which are all brought forth out of the good treasure of grace in the heart . 

2.  Do nothing in time , but what will pass in your account , when your time is at an end : Christ will one day say to thee , Give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayst be no longer steward , Luk. 16.2 . Give an account of thy Health , Life , Parts , Estate ; of Sabbaths , Sermons , Sacraments , and all thy precious opportunities ; for thou must no longer use or enjoy these . Now what a sad reckoning will here be , if he hath one nothing with these that will pass in his account ? as if a great man intrust a servant to be his Steward , and commit to him his money , rents , etc. to disburse according to his Master's pleasure : Now if when the Steward is called to give up his account , he is able to reckon , So much laid out for provision for the family , so much for the education of the children , so much to relieve the poor ; these things will pass in his account : but if he reckons , So much wasted in drunkenness , so much converted to my own use , etc. the Master will never accept of this . So , my brethren , when God calls us to an account of our stewardship , if a man can say , Lord , I spent my estate in the education of my children , in feeding and maintaining my family , in relieving the poor ; I spent my parts in making God and Christ known to others ; I spent my time to please and praise thee , to profit others , and save myself ; these things will pass in thy account ; and thou shalt be sure of thy reward and honour of a faithful servant , when the time of my Stewardship is expired : but if it appear that a man hath wasted his estate on his lusts , and spent his time in his sins , his account must needs be sad , when he must have hell for his wages : whatever ye do , consider whether it will pass in your account ; and look upon every thing now , as it will prove when you are to give an acount for it . It is a remarkable expression , Phil. 4.17 . I desire fruit that may abound to your account ; many things which a believer doth with an upright heart , seem but little now , but they will rise , and abound to his glory , when he comes to give an account . 

3.  Do nothing but what thou art willing to have thyself ; the very Nation wherein thou livest , and thy time , to have a name from the doing of it : for it is observable , that the actions of men give a name to these three things , viz. to themselves , to the places , and to the times wherein they live . 

1.  then do nothing but what thou wouldst have a name from the doing of it : man love's sin , but he cannot endure to be called according to his sins ; but if thou dost abhor the name of a drunkard , swearer , liar , why dost thou live in the sins of drunkenness , swearing and lying ? 

2.  Do nothing that thou wouldst not have the land to have a name from ; for the land hath a name from the practice of the people ; a holy people make a holy nation ; a profane , unclean , perfidious people make a land of profaneness , of whoredoms , of treachery , etc.  What sins thou livest in , thou dost not only make thyself , but also , as much as in thee lies , thou makest the land laothsome to God and men . 

3.  Do nothing which thou wouldst not have thy time have a name from ; it makes thee have sad thoughts to think of the time of drunkenness , whoredom , lying , etc. but times of prayer , meditation , holy conference , etc. are sweet . 

4.  Take heed of idleness ; this sin makes empty and unprofitable times , and leaves people unprepared for sickness . When Calvin was reproved for inordinate labour , he gives this savoury answer : What , saith he , would ye have my Lord find me idle ? Sirs , would you have sickness , and death , and the day of judgement find you idle ? Our Saviour in the Parable having entrusted his servants with their talents , he bids them , Occupy till I come , Luk. 19.13 . See Christ's coming , and improve your talents for him till he come . Now that you may abhor this sin of idleness , 

1.  Consider , that if you be not doing good , you will be doing hurt ; man is a busy creature : let a man look at any time within himself , he can never see his heart stand still . We read of some , 2 Thess . 3.11 . Who work not at all , and yet are busybodies . Sirs , the soul is quick at work ; a man may quickly lay up abundance of treasures in heaven or hell : For as Bernard saith well , If you are not exercised in the labours of men , you are in the labours of devils . 

2.  Make the work of Salvation thy main business ; labour to turn every day into a day of Salvation . Sirs , it is an excellent thing for a man to live so in his calling , relations , recreations , afflictions , duties of God's worship , as if all the powers of his body and soul were set upon the work of Salvation : this will keep a man from idleness ; For that man will never want business , that knows he hath a soul to save . 

3.  Consider what little time thou hast for this great work : perhaps it may never be done , if it be not done now : they were fools that said , Let us eat and drink , for to morrow we die : it had been a wiser speech to have said , Let us repent , believe and pray , for to morrow we die . 

4.  Consider what thou hast to set thee on work , and to keep thee from idleness , look into hell , and see sin , and the world , and devils thrusting thee therein , and thou wilt find it business enough to save thee from those unquenchable flames : Look into heaven , and see God , and Christ , and Ministers , and Christians always calling thee thither ; and see thy own sins , carnal friends , men , devils , a world of stumbling-blocks lying in thy way to stop thee from going into that everlasting happiness , and thou wilt find work enough to go to heaven : Look into thyself , and see what sins thou hast to conquer and bewail , what wants to supply , what graces to quicken and ripen , what duties to perform , what storms and trouble's to prepare against : Look on God , on Christ , and see what objects are there , for all the powers of thy body and soul to be exercised upon . Hast thou any time for idle thoughts , or words , or affections , that hast such a God and Christ to think of , and to speak of , and to set and fix thy heart , and love , and delight upon ! Look into the family , and town , and place where thou livest , and see Christless parents , or Christless children , or Christless brothers and sisters , or Christless servants , or Christless neighbours , and thou mayst have that in thee to speak or do , which may save their souls from hell ; and shall they perish and be damned by thy idleness ? Look into the Church and Kingdom where thou livest , and consider wherein thou mayst serve them , and be a blessing to them ; and how thou mayst be an instrument to fill them with the Name , and Kingdom , and Will of Jesus Christ : Nay , look upon every creature about thee , the Heavens , Earth , Waters , Birds , Beasts , Plants , etc. see them all filled with the Power , Wisdom and goodness of God , and , as it were , bringing their praises to thee , that thou mayst be their mouth to honour and exalt God. Methinks , Sirs , these things should keep us from idleness . 

5.  That thou mayst fill up thy time , take heed of losing a suffering opportunity . Beloved , a suffering opportunity is a precious opportunity ; it 's an opportunity to honour God , further the Gospel , to save thy own and others souls , to be a blessing to thy posterity , and to leave thy name as a blessed savour behind thee . I would not tempt men to lust after sufferings ; I know the Devil would have his servants to serve him by passive as well as active obedience ; yet I would have none so base , as to choose to sin rather than to suffer , and to prefer Apostasy before Martyrdom . Sometimes a man may fall into such a nick of time , that duty may cost him his life , and a sin may save his life : This case is implied in the words of our Saviour , Mat. 16.25 . Whosoever will save his life , shall lose it ; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake , shall save it . Now that is a sad loss of a suffering opportunity , when a man saves himself from suffering by sin : Consider the fearful consequences of this ; hereby thou savest thy estate , name , life , and losest thy soul ; which is clearly implied in the next words , vers . 26.  For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? Remember , when thou runnest into a known sin , to avoid suffering , thou makest a bargain , thou makest an exchange ; thou gettest the world , and the Devil and Hell get thy soul . Consider further , it is the highest improvement of thy name , estate and life , to sacrifice it to the glory and will of Christ , by suffering for him : this is the best that thou canst make of thyself . Sirs , it is more honourable ( if thou art called to it ) to be burned at a stake for Christ , then to be burned with Fever ; or to die for Christ in a Prison , then to die in a sick bed . 

Consider lastly , What a woeful case will sickness and death find thee in , when those evils which thou fearedst from men , shall be brought upon thee by God ; when God shall fill thy body with greater pains than the cruelest Persecutor could invent or inflict ! O what a loss will then a suffering opportunity be , when a man may say , I had an opportunity to lose my life , and save my soul ; and now I must lose my life , and my poor soul too ! 

Direct . 5.  That you may be prepared for sickness and death , do nothing but what you would have sickness and death find you doing . Remember , what ever thou art about , that sickness and death may find thee in it : Death found Zimri and Cozbi in whoredom , Numb . 25.8 . and Death took Ananias and Saphira in a lie , Acts 5. and Death caught Eutychus sleeping at a Sermon , Acts 20.9 . 

And on the other hand , God took Enoch walking with God , Gen. 5.24 . And when Elijah and Elisha were talking together , no doubt of some good , Elijah was fain to break off his good discourse to go to heaven , 2 Kings 2.11 . and Christ went blessing his people to heaven , Luke 24.51 . And good Stephen , as he was praying , was taken from off his knees into heaven , Acts 7.60 . O Sirs , if you would not go lying , or swearing , or drunk , or swaggering , or ranting into Eternity , do not practise these sins now , but walk in your callings , recreations and duties , as if you saw sickness and death fetching you out of these into heaven . 

Direct . 6.  Labour to be filled with a merciful and tender disposition towards others in their sickness and misery ; this is a sure way for thee to find mercy from God in thy sickness : With the merciful , thou wilt show thyself merciful , Psal . 18.25 . Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy , Matth. 5.7 . We have a precious promise to this purpose , Psal . 41.1 , 2 , 3.  Blessed is he that considereth the poor . By the poor is meant , not only the poor in estate , but also those that are poor and afflicted , in respect of other afflictions . And it 's a most blessed frame of heart for men , when they sit in health , and at ease , and swim in wealth , to be seriously considering their poor diseased and afflicted brethren : The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble . The Lord will preserve him , and keep him alive . The Lord will strengthen him on the bed of languishing ; thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness . I say therefore , show mercy to others in their sickness ; and when the day of sickness , and death , and judgement comes , thou shalt be sure ( as Paul prayed for Onesiphorus in the like case ) to find mercy at that day . 

Direct . 7.  Be fully satisfied in the belief of God's care and providence towards thy friends whom thou art to leave behind thee . Beloved , it makes the thoughts of sickness and death more grievous to many , because of the sad and miserable condition which their poor Orphans and Widows will be left in when they are gone ; and especially if their condition be like that of learned and godly Oecolampadius , who when he should have made his Will , had nothing to bequeath . But this trouble is not so much for want of an Estate , as for want of Faith : therefore go cheerfully to your sick beds , or deathbeds , with the belief of these following Scriptures , Jer. 49.11 . Leave thy fatherless children , I will preserve them alive , and let thy Widows trust in me . In which words , as appears by the context , God threatens the Edomites , that their children and wives shall be left so desolate , that they shall have none but God to provide for them : Yet God is so tender of poor fatherless children and widows , that though they were of the families and posterity of Esau , yet , saith he , I will preserve them alive . How much more tender than will he be of the poor families of his Jacob ! 

See also Psal . 10.14 . The poor committeth his cause to thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless . Perhaps it trouble's thee to think what a company of poor helpless children thou art to leave behind thee : Why consider , the infinite and all-sufficient God makes it one of his great works to help fatherless children ; therefore this great Creator of the world will be glorified by this name , The helper of the fatherless . 

See further , Psal . 68.3 , 4 , 5.  Observe here , one great reason why the righteous must be glad , and exceedingly rejoice , and sing forth the praises of God , is , because he is a father of the fatherless , and a judge of the widow in his holy habitation . Observe , In his holy habitation : God is in heaven , not only filling Angels and Saints with his glorious likeness and presence , but he is there also full of gracious thoughts towards poor fatherless children and widows upon earth . And although I do not think that there is any intercourse betwixt a Saint in heaven , and his family upon earth ; and I do not know that he will in heaven be offering prayers for them upon earth ; yet I do not doubt but he will there know , that he hath left a family behind him upon earth , and by his glorious vision of God , will see that Infinite Power and Providence which provides for his and all other families upon earth , so far as is for his own glory , and the good of his Church . 

See again , Hosea 14.3 . In thee the fatherless find mercy . It may trouble thee to think , that although now thy wife and children are respected for thy sake , yet when thou art gone , they are like to find the world cruel and unfaithful , friends hard and unkind , etc. but take comfort and satisfaction in this Scripture , where thou seest not only that there is mercy in God for fatherless children , but also that they shall find it , and have the comfort and experience of it . I shall therefore conclude this with the exhortation of the Apostle , Phil. 4.6 , 7.  Be careful for nothing , but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving , let your requests be made known unto God : and then , as to any trouble about these things , The peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus . 

Direct . 8.  Labour to make a wise and holy use of the spectacles of mortality ; look upon yourselves as following your dead neighbours and friends , whom you see going before you into Eternity . It is said of a dead man , Job 21.33 . The clods of the valley ( viz. the Graves and Sepulchers ) shall be sweet unto him ; and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable gone before him . Consider , when you see any one buried , that he is gone to an innumerable company that are dead and buried before him , and that every man shall draw after him . O remember , that you are drawing after your dead grandfathers , and fathers , and friends , which are gone before you . Poor wretch , thou thinkest that thou shouldst be like thy Neighbours , to have as much wealth , and honours , and pleasures as they : but look upon other Neighbours , who are lodged in the chambers of death , and remember , thou art shortly to be like unto them . The very carcases in the graves are ready to say unto thee , as the Prophet brings in the inhabitants of the Tombs crying to the King of Babylon , Isai . 14.10 . All they shall speak and say unto thee , Art thou also become weak as we ? Art th‚óèu become like unto us ? Look upon every thing about thy friend's Funeral with a particular application to thyself ; look on the Bier at the door , as if it stood there to receive thee ; look on the Coffin , as if it were made for thee ; and look on the Winding-sheet , as if it were washed and made ready for thee : Look on the Sexton's Spade , as ready to dig a grave for thee : Certainly these things would prove excellent means to fit us for sickness and death . 

Direct . 9  Keep up a spirit of prayer ; for surely a man is in a great measure fit to die , who is fit to pray . This appears by the Preface to the Petitions in the Lord's Prayer , Our Father which art in heaven ; whereby we see , that a Child of God by prayer doth , as it were , part from the world , and is with his Father which is in Heaven . Hence , Heb. 10.19 . Prayer is called , An entering into the Holiest , viz. into Heaven : Besides , it is easy to demonstrate , that the same things which make us fit to pray , make us fit to die , and that a praying frame is a dying frame ; for our hearts are most set upon those things when we pray , which we must receive when we die : Death brings us to the things which we pray for ; and he that is unwilling to die , is unwilling to receive an answer to his own prayers . Beloved , it often puzzles the thoughts of men , to think what will be the issue of things , what things will come to at the last . Now it seems to me a clear and excellent expedient for our satisfaction herein , to study well the Lords Prayer , and to believe that all the Petitions therein shall certainly be granted ; and whatever we see before , for certain at the Day of Judgement every Petition therein shall be fulfilled : and therefore the more a man's heart is set on those things for which we are thereby taught and bound to pray , the more ready and fit he is for Death and Judgement . Prayer is one of the first and last things of a Christian : so soon as ever the spiritual life is begun , it presently breathes in prayer ; and I am persuaded , that the godly do usually die in prayer . 

Last Direct . Live as one that knows that there are bounds set to thy life : It makes many so unprepared for sickness and death , because they look upon their lives as boundless ; they always think they have some time to live , and therefore think of no time to die . Now it is clear , that God hath set bounds to the life of every man ; and when he comes to those bounds , he is stopped , and can go no further , Job 14.5 . thou hast appointed his bounds , that he cannot pass . Proud men climb to such a height of preferment ; and as they are rising higher , Death stops them , and they can go no further : The covetous man gets such an estate ; and as he is reaching after greater wealth , Death stops him , that he can get no more . O what a sudden stop did Death cause that rich Fool to make , when he was constrained to die the same very night , when he thought he was , as it were , beginning to live : The malicious man goes to such a height of persecuting the godly ; and as he is raging in his malice and madness , Death stops him , that he can go no farther . O what a stop did Haman meet with in the very height of his bloody design against the Church of God On the other hand , the poor Child of God is zealous in worshipping and serving God ; and as he is seeking to serve and praise him more , Death stops him , and his work is done : therefore do every thing is knowing that thou mayst meet with thy bounds , and be stopped in the very midst of thy work : All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come , saith Job , Cap. 14.14 . Job knew that there was a change to come , and that Death would make a great alteration with him shortly , and that there was a secret time appointed for this change ; therefore he will every day wait and look for it . Think with thyself in a morning , I may see a great change before night ; and think with thyself at night , I may see a great alteration before morning . Sirs , when a man goes from his house , friends , food and estate , to heaven or hell , believe it , he will find a great alteration . O then live , as if every day were to be the day of thy change ; as if every journey , and work , and duty , would bring thee to the end and bounds of thy life . 

So much for Exhortation , to be prepared for sickness and death . 

The next Exhortation is to such who have been visited with sickness , but are by the mercy and power of Jesus Christ restored to health . I shall exhort such to these five duties . 

1.  Bless and praise God , who hath restored thee to thy health : God tells his people , Exod. 15.26 . I am the God that heal‚óè‚óè thee : And certainly there comes power ‚óènd virtue from Jesus Christ to heal our disease's : Therefore when Christ had healed the woman diseased with an issue of ‚óèlood twelve years , I perceive , saith he , that virtue is gone from me , Luke 8.46 . And be‚óèoved , when ever we have been diseased ‚óènd restored , there came virtue from Christ ‚óè‚óèto the head , or lungs , or liver , or where ‚óèver the disease lay , and caused the cure ; which we must in all thankfulness acknowledge . Thus did David , Psal . 116.6 . ‚Äî 8.  I was brought low , and he helped me . ‚Äî For thou hast delivered my soul from death , ‚óèy eyes from tears , and my feet from falling . Now for the performance of this du‚óèy of praising God , observe these five directions . 

1.  Get a clear knowledge of the glorious and excellent Name of God , Psal . 76.1 . I‚óè Judah is God known , his name is great in Israel . God's Name is great only where it is known ; and it is a most savoury thing to hear people speak of God , as those that know whom they speak of : Where God is thus savingly known , the workings of the heart towards God are answerable to the glory and excellency of his Name , Psal . 48.10 . According to thy Name , OH God , so is thy praise , Psal . 150.2 . Praise the Lord according to his excellent greatness . Grace is more or lesle in a man , according to his knowledge and sense of the Name of God and Jesus Christ : In that heart where God hath no Name , the man hath no Grace ; but it causeth great faith , and great love , and great joy in a Believer , to see the great power , and the great love , and the great goodness of God and Jesus Christ . 

2.  Praise God as he is a God of mercy to thee ; ascribe unto him a name from that which he hath done for thee , Psal . 42.8 . My prayer shall be to the God of my life . He honour's God with this Title , The God of his life , Psal . 59.10 . The God of my mercy , Psal . 18.1 , 2.  I will love thee , OH Lord , my strength . The Lord is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer . ‚Äî Believe it poor Christian , that the God of all the world is pleased and praised by thy calling him thy God ; and therefore praise God as his glory shines and appears in all other things , and as it appears to thee : As thus , the God of all the world , and my God ; the Father of Jesus Christ , and my Father ; the God of life and health to his people , and the God of my life , and of my health . 

3.  Labour to the utmost of thy power to fill all places with the Name of God , and Jesus Christ , Psal . 66.2 . Make his praise glorious . This is a right praising God , when we endeavour to make his Name glorious in the hearts of all that are about us : our lives should be such , that in every thing that we do , there may be reason to cause others to love , bless , praise , and rejoice in God , Mat. 5.16 . Our works should be such , that they should set all that see them on work to glorify our Father which is in heaven ; and we should live so , that it may be an honour to God to be called the God of such a people . Now is it any honour to God to be called the God of Drunkards , or the God of Swearers , or the God of Whoremongers ? no , no ; but as Master Latimer said , they may say , Our father which art in hell : But the God of Believers , the God of all that love him , and fear him , and seek him , it is his honour to be called the God of such a people ; and , as it is said , Heb. 11.16 . He is not ashamed to be called their God.  

4.  Let every thing that hath been the subject of mercy , be the instrument of praise . David calls upon all that is within him to praise Gods holy Name ‚Äî Who heals all his diseases , Psal . 103 , 1 , 3. ‚Äî And we are commanded to yield our members as instruments of righteousness unto God , Rom. 6.13 . Sirs , every member of a Christian is a member of Christ , and the Life of Christ spreads all over , and fills his whole body ; and this life should branch out in all the parts and members of our bodies : Christ hath bought and paid for all ; the Law binds all ; every member can be an instrument of sin , every member must at last be clothed with glory : therefore we should glorify God with our bodies and souls , which are Gods , 1 Cor. 6.20 . Consider , What may I do for God with my tongue , hands , feet , countenance ? etc. Perhaps , not long since , thy whole body was overspread with a disease , and there was no soundness in thy flesh , because of God's anger ; neither was there any rest in thy bones , because of thy sins : Never a bone or joint was free from pain . Now then , seeing God hath healed all , thou shouldst say with David , Psal . 35.10 . All my bones may say , Lord , who is like to thee ? 

Lastly , Let the consideration of the greatness of thy mercy , cause thee to praise God : Consider this in four particulars . 

1.  thou art restored to life ; God hath , as it were , clearly given thee a life : We have this passage in Jer. 45.5 . and elsewhere in Scripture , Thy life will I give unto thee for a prey ; the meaning seems to be thus , that when a man's life is in great danger , though he suffer diverse losses , yet if his life be saved , he triumphs in the preservation of his life , as if he had got a great prey or spoil from an enemy . Now to apply this to the present case : perhaps thou hast suffered diverse losses and crosses in thy sickness , and now thou art restored : thou mayst see many things sad in the Church , and in thy family ; but thy life is given instead of a prey to thee , and in this thou hast cause to rejoice : Look at thy life , and consider what a mercy that is , and thou wilt see great reason to praise God in the midst of thy greatest afflictions . O then let thy life be laid out to the will and glory of God : say with David after his recovery from a great danger , Psal . 116.9 . I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living ; do nothing but what thou canst with comfort do before the Lord , as seeing the allseeing God looking on . 

2.  thou art restored to thy health ; consider how lately the multitude of thy bones were tortured with strong pains ; thy stomach was gone , and thy life did abhor bread , and thy soul dainty meat , Job 33.19 , 20.  thou wouldst have given much for a night's sleep , when wearisome nights were appointed to thee , Job 7.3 . yet now God hath given thee health , he hath caused thy bones to rejoice , and filled thy heart with food and gladness , and thou liest down , and thy sleep is sweet unto thee . 

3.  thou art restored to thy friends and relations ; to thy husband , wife , children , parents , brothers and sisters , and to thy dear and bosom-friends : the day would have been sad to these mourners going about the streets , following thee to thy long home : But now God hath restored comfort to thee , and to thy mourners , Isa . 5.18 . therefore let the sight of all thy friends fill thee with a fresh sense of the goodness and mercy of God : Say as Jacob said of his Brother Esau in another case , Gen. 33.10 . I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God : See the gracious face and presence of God shining upon thee in the face of all thy friends ; look on thy yoke-fellow , and look upon God ; look on thy parents , and look upon God ; look on thy children , etc. and look upon God ; and so as the sight of every friend fills thee with new and fresh thoughts of thy mercy , let it also renew in thee a fresh and thankful remembrance of the God of thy mercy . 

Lastly , thou art restored to thy blessed and soulsaving opportunities . Sirs , if we consider how precious time is , we must needs acknowledge this to be a precious mercy : now that you may see time precious , and so for this reason may esteem your recovery a precious mercy ; look on thy time as the season allowed thee to glorify God , and to work out the Salvation of thy soul : you know in other cases we prise our time according to the worth of those things which time gives us an opportunity to gain : as the husbandman accounts Harvest-time precious , because it is his season to reap the precious fruits of the earth , as St. James calls them , Jam. 5.7 . The Merchant accounts the time precious when the wind blows him to his prize . The soldier accounts the time precious when he marches for his life . 

And is not that time much more precious which God hath given thee to save thy soul ? If God , and Christ , and Heaven , and Grace , and the Soul be precious , than that time must needs be precious , which gives thee an opportunity to gain these . The Apostle determines this , 2 Cor. 6.2 . Now is the accepted time , now is the day of salvation : Now God is offering Christ for thy Salvation ; now the Spirit is striving for thy Salvation ; now Ministers are praying , preaching and travelling for thy Salvation . Thus God fills thy time with salvation-work . O than what a mercy it is to be restored to such precious opportunities ! when perhaps , if thou hadst died in thy last sickness , thou wast in great danger to be damned ; and now thou hast time to labour to be saved . 

The second Duty to be performed by those who are restored to health , is this : Keep up a frequent remembrance of thy visitation , and of the Lords dealing with thee therein . It seems by the contents of it , that David penned Psalm 38. in a time of great sickness ; and it 's very observable , that he gives that Psalm this title , A psalm of David to bring to remembrance : Implying , that one special use of this Psalm was to bring his sickness to remembrance : Whence we may learn , that it is our duty in our health to be often remembering the hand of God in our sickness : when thou art full of mirth , and findest thy heart apt to be loose from God in thy recreations ; then remember the pains of sickness , and this will cause a spirit of moderation and sobriety to rule thy heart : when thou art going to worship God , it may much quicken thee with a new and fresh spirit , to consider how near thou wast to eternity in such a sickness , and to go to duty as one that is newly risen out of a sickbed ; and that thou art still praying , hearing , receiving Sacraments , as it were , in the very gates of death . 

So when thou art tempted to any sin , remember thy sickness : consider , wilt thou bring again upon thyself an Ague , Fever , Dropsy , Consumption & c ? Beloved , in abundance of cases it will do your souls much good to be often remembering your visitation . 

Thirdly , examine what good thou hast got by thy visitation . Beloved , many come out of a sickness like Rogues out of a gaol ; Rogues they went in , and worse Rogues they come out : So they were Drunkards , Whoremongers , Persecutors of God's people , when they went into sickness ; and are far worse , and more hardened in their sins , when they come out of sickness : Let us therefore all examine what good we have got by our sickness ; as you know after a man hath been in a course of Physic , he observes whether he coughs lesle , or burns lesle , etc. and whether his stomach be better , and strength better , and sleep better ; so if thou hast been in a course of sickness , observe whether thy corruptions abate , and whether thy heart be better since thy visitation : is pride lesle , and peevishness lesle , and covetousness lesle ? and canst thou pray better , and sanctify Sabbaths better , and hear Sermons better ? and is thy discourse better , and thy life better ? David upon search found sweet experience of the blessed effect of his affliction , Psal . 119.67 . Before I was afflicted , I went astray , but now have I kept thy statutes : So , canst thou say , Before I was sick , I could not endure to be provoked ; I was very light and loose in company , I was very apt to be proud and selfconceited ; but now I bless God I am more patient , and more serious , and more humble . 

Fourthly , take special care to avoid sin after thy recovery ; I say to thee , as Christ said to another upon the same occasion , Joh. 5.14 . thou art made whole , sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee : thou thoughtest thy disease was very bad and grievous ; but consider , there are worse things than thy sickness was , worse pains and worse miseries . O than sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee : I shall press this duty in these four Particulars . 

First , watch especially against those sins which thou wast most inclined unto before thy sickness . Some conceive that the impotent man beforementioned , was visited especially for some particular sin , which our Saviour did particularly aim at in bidding him sin no more . The Apostle tells us of some , 2 Pet. 2.22 . that return with the dog to his own vomit ; where he compares those that seemed to loath sin , and after return to the same sin , to a sick dog , which when he hath eased himself by vomiting up that which made him sick , goes and licks up again his own loathsome vomit : and so we see very many who lick up in time of health those very sins which they seemed to loath and vomit up in time of sickness . Beloved , sin appears in its acts most strong , when the instruments are most strong therewith a man commits it ; and the weakness of the instruments causeth a weakness in the acts of sin ; and therefore when the body is weak , all those sins which are fulfilled by the body , seem weak too : but now when the body gathers strength , as a man hath strength to eat , and strength to work , and strength to walk ; so without the mighty power of the Spirit , strength will also return into sin . Therefore I say , Watch , and pray , and fight against those sins which thou wast most apt to commit before thy sickness . 

Secondly , take heed of surfeiting with the profits , and pleasures , and preferments of the world ; for as a man after long fasting is apt to surfeit when he returns to his meat ; so when a man by sickness hath been long withheld from the creature , there appears such a fresh kind of pleasure and delight in the world , and the heart is so eager in the desires of it , that there is great danger of being glutted with it : We should therefore receive all the blessings of the creature , as the Israelites did eat the Pass-over , Exod. 12.11 . where we find that they were to eat the Pass-over , as those that were ready to go out of Egypt towards Canaan , with their loins gird , their shoes on their feet , their staffs in their hands , and they were to eat it in haste . So , my brethren , we should eat , drink , buy , fell , work , take our recreations , as those that are hasting away into eternity , and as if we were ready dressed to go to heaven . 

Thirdly , Beware of security : for we are apt herein to be like Pharaoh , who when one plague was past , thought himself safe enough from that or any other : So when one fit of sickness is past , we look for no more , but dream of a long time of ease , and peace , and health before us : but we should be rather like one that is sick of an Ague , who when the fit is over , eats , drinks , and is merry , but yet he looks for another fit : So Sirs , is a sickness over and past ? why , I do not deny but that God who hath given thee a stomach , and provided food , would have thee to eat and drink ; and he that hath created matter for thy delight , and made thee a risible creature , doth allow thee to be merry and cheerful ; yet look for another fit : sickness is like to come again , and death will be sure to come shortly ; therefore take heed of security . 

Lastly , that heed of pride and vainglory ; this was the sin of good Hezekiah , of whom we read , that after he was recovered from his sickness , his heart was lifted up , 2 Chron. 22.24 , 25. and this appeared , in that when he was courted by the King of Babylon , he did in a bravado show all his riches , Isa . 39.2 . Poor Hezekiah , thou wast in a better frame , when on thy sickbed thou wast turning thy face to the wall ; but we may see by this sad instance , how apt we are after a mercy and deliverance , to be puffed up with high thoughts and conceits of ourselves . 

The last Duty which I shall mention , is this : Be careful to perform thy sick-bed-vows and resolutions . A vow is a solemn promise made to God , either of a duty , or of something which may further us in our duty to God. The matter of a vow is either to do that which God commands , or to forsake sin which God forbids , or to do something to further our obedience , or to abstain from something which might be an occasion of sin , and which we may abstain from : A vow must not be of a thing unlawful ; for that were as if we should promise God to hate him , or not to love him ; it must be also of that which we have power to do , else we have no power to promise to do it : The nature of a vow is a promise made to God , which promise brings an obligation upon us to perform it : this promise must not be made rashly ; for a vow must be the fruit of grace , and not the fruit of sin : and we must not make promises to God in a passion ; yet I do not deny , but such vows must be performed ; for it 's one thing sinfully to vow , and another thing to vow to sin ; in such a case we must be humbled for the manner of the vow , and graciously pay what we sinfully vowed . It hath been the practice of the godly to make vows to God in their troubles , Psal . 132.1 , 2.  Lord , remember David , and all his afflictions ; how he swore unto the Lord , and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob. Now Sirs , in the fear of God make conscience to perform your sick-bed-vows : Indeed , wicked men are forward to make vows when they are sick , and as forward to break them when they are well : As Pharaoh , when the plagues were upon him , he would let Israel go ; but when they were removed , his heart was hardened , and they should not go . But it is the property of a godly man to make good his vows , Psal . 15.4 . Hence saith David , Psal . 56.12 . Thy vows are upon me , OH God. Beloved , vows are heavy things ; David felt them lying upon him , and pressing him to the performance of them . Vows take up a great deal of room in the soul ; they fill the conscience : when a man is tempted to do that which he hath vowed against , his vow will be upon him presently , that he dare not do it . See what conscience David made of his vows , Psal . 66.13 , 14.  I will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken when I was in trouble , Psal . 116.14 . I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people . Sirs , if you break your vows ‚ñ™ your vows will break you . I shall conclude this in the words of Solomon , Eccles . 5.4 , 5.  When thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed . Better it is that thou shouldst not vow , then that thou shouldst vow , and not pay . 

So much for the Exhortation to those who are recovered from sickness . 

My last Exhortation is , to exhort you to some Duties to be performed in time of sickness , which I shall lay before you in these twelve particulars . 

Duty 1.  Own and acknowledge the hand of God in thy visitation : as a man in a crowd , that receives a blow upon his head ; will presently turn about to see whence the stroke comes ; so , as soon as God's hand toucheth thee , let thy eye be upon him , and labour to find a special presence of God appearing in thy visitation . Poor soul ! thou art now parted from the use of Ordinances in public , and thou must labour to find Sabbaths , and Sermons , and Sacraments in thy sickness ; that is , thou must endeavour to find the presence of God that appears in these Ordinances , appearing to thy soul in the aches , and troubles , and pains of a sickness . To this purpose , I have read a saying of an holy Minister of the Gospel , which he spoke on his sickbed concerning people that were then worshipping God in public , O ( said he ) that they did now see , what I do now feel ! we have a choice example of this duty of acknowledging the hand of God in our visitation , in Job , cap. 1. where we read , that after he had stood still , and heard the messengers which came one upon the heels of the another , with the sad tidings of the loss of his cattles , and servants , and children ; the very first thing he does , is to turn to God , and to fall down and worship him , and acknowledge his hand in his affliction , vers . 20 , 21. so I say , So soon as ever thy disease begins , presently own , and acknowledge , and worship God , who is the cause of thy visitation ; so did David , Psal . 38.2 . Thy arrows stick fast in me , and thy hand presseth me sore . Consider , this affliction comes from the Wisdom , and Will , and Power , and Justice of God ; and by this disease he hath now chosen to come to thee , and to appear to thee ; therefore labour to have thy heart filled with him , that all thy words and actions may favour of him . Hereby thou wilt see Reason against all Sin , and Reason for all Duties , and withal a ground for all comforts . 

Duty 2.  Labour to have thy heart filled with the thoughts of thy death and judgement : it is the great sin of many , that in their sickness strive to put the thoughts of death and judgement far from them , and labour to fill their hearts with confidence that they shall live ; and so many poor wretches fall into hell before they did think they should die . But certainly , it 's the safest and wisest way , so soon as thou art assaulted with sickness , to see thy death and judgement standing before thee , and to receive the sentence of death in thyself , 2 Cor. 1.9 . Look upon thy disease as bringing thee to death , and after that to a judgement , which will settle thee in heaven or hell presently . As thou liest on thy sickbed , look into the other great world , where thou art entering ; see in what state , place and company thou art now to all eternity to be fixed : Look into hell , and see those many million of Devils that are chained up there : Look what a dreadful case the learned , great , rich , strong and beautiful swaggerers , ranters , and gallants of the proud , presumptuous , scornful , unbelieving , envious , secure , covetous world are now flaming in ; and consider , that thou deservest to lie in the midst of them ; and therefore now the greatest care of thy soul should be , how to be saved from those unquenchable flames . 

then look into heaven into thy Father's house , and behold there the high and lofty one dwelling in that high and holy place , and the Lord Jesus sitting at his right hand in glory , and an innumerable company of Angels looking him in the face ; and there see a great multitude of blessed and glorified Saints : Illic Apostolorum gloriosus chorus , illic Prophetarum exultantium numerus , illic Martyrum innumerabilis populus : There is the glorious choir of Apostles , there is a company of triumphant Prophets , and there is an innumerable multitude of blessed Martyrs , saith Cyprian : There thou mayst see those who were upon earth , the poor , reviled , despised , afflicted , persecuted , imprisoned , banished , hanged , burned Children of the most high God , whom the world could not bear ; but are now happily possessed of their everlasting Kingdom , where they are filled and satisfied with the likeness and presence of God , and are singing and rejoicing with unspeakable joy to behold his glory : And then consider , Yonder is the place , wherein I am now to seek to enter . And thus let thy sickness fill thee with the deep and serious thoughts of death , judgement , and the world to come . 

Duty 3.  Be sure of a wellgrounded Scripture-peace settled betwixt God and thy soul : it 's a good saying , That the day of death is a day of truth : See therefore that thou hast a peace which will prove true and sound when it comes to the great trial of death and judgement . The unbeliever is not then to be tried at the bar of his own secure and seared conscience , nor by a Jury of carnal atheistical neighbours . The Believer hath then a present appeal from the ‚óèash and false judgement of his enemies , and also from the dismal sentences of his own doubting heart ; and the Cause of both is presently to go to a hearing before the judgement-seat of Christ : Now see that thy peace be settled on such a sure foundation , that thou mayst be found in safety and glory , when thou art called to appear before the Judge of quick and dead . There are two main things which may assure thy heart of peace and reconciliation with God.  

1.  If Christ's righteousness be thy own , so that as sure as thou art a sinner in thyself , thou art righteous in and by the righteousness and obedience of Jesus Christ : See therefore that all causes agree to make this righteousness thy own . 

1.  Set the Lord before thy eyes , and be able to say , I know , and am surely convinced , that God is a good God , a living , kind and merciful God , and that he is good to poor sinners ; by the salvation of whom , he hath chosen to make his goodness glorious to all eternity : I know that there are forgivenesses with him ; that he hath a heart to pardon iniquity , transgression and sin ; that he is inclined , and ready to pardon according to his infinite goodness and loving kindness ; and this goodness is the cause of all that great Salvation revealed in the Gospel : and I come to him , and my soul doth cleave to him , and love him ; and all my expectation is from him , as he is a God of such infinite and incomprehensible goodness . 

2.  I know that out of this infinite goodness he hath sent Jesus Christ to me , that to me a child is born , and to me a son is given , Isai . 9.6 . I know surely that he came out from the Father , and I do believe that he hath sent him , John 17.8 . I know that the Son of God is come , and hath given me an understanding , that I might know him that is true , and I am in him that is true . This is the true God , and eternal life . 

3.  God hath herein commended his love to my soul , in that Christ died for me ; and I know this true God , the Lord Jesus Christ , did in his infinite love to me , as my Surety , die for me , and thereby satisfied God's justice for my sins , which he bore in his body upon the tree , 1 Pet. 4.24 . And that he loved me , and gave himself for me an offering , and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling savour . 

4.  I know that it is the will of God concerning me , that I should take this righteousness of Jesus Christ to be mine ; for he hath commanded me to take his ‚óèody as broken for me , and his Blood ‚óès shed for the remission of my sins : And this is his commandment , that I ‚óèould believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ . 

5.  I know that God by his Spirit hath convinced me , that I am lost without Christ , and that he hath made me to see his righteousness so precious , and meritorious , and necessary for my Salvation , that I do by the power of his Spirit willingly , obediently , lovingly and joyfully receive and take this righteousness of Christ for my own , and rest only upon it for the pardon of my sins , and for my Salvation , as it is freely offered and given by God to me in the Gospel . 

Lastly , I know that God hereupon imputes this righteousness to me , and accounts it my righteousness ; and that I am bound to accounted it my own , so as to own it , live upon it , and to glory in it : and by this righteousness God justfies me , being he is just , and the justifier of them that believe in Jesus , Rom. 3.26 . And thus being justified by faith in Christ's righteousness , I have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ , Rom. 5.1 . And hereby I have a right through the free grace of God to go from my sickbed into the everlasting Kingdom of peace : And when I am called to the Judgement-seat of Christ , being found in his righteousness , I shall be found of him in peace , without spot and blameless . 

2.  That thou mayst be assured of a Scripture-peace and reconciliation with God , labour to find thyself truly joined and united to Jesus Christ , thy whole body and soul joined to all of Christ , so as with him to make one self , one mystical Christ , that thou mayst be able to say , As poor and weak as I lie here groaning on this bed of languishing ; yet this aching head , pale face , weak hands , feeble limbs , withered body , is all a member of Christ's body , of his flesh , and of his bones , Eph. 5.30 . For by the grace of God I can say , that whereas I am in myself a dead plant , and as separated from Christ can doing nothing , yet by faith my heart is truly rooted in Christ ; and I do receive him to rule me , as my Lord , according to his will , and to teach , and every way to save me ; and my mind is set upon him , and my heart and affections do cleave , and are fastened to him ; and there comes true spirit and life from him , which spreads and works in all the powers of my soul ‚óènd members of my body ; and I can say ‚óèf many things that I do , that they come ‚óèot from my created nature , or corrupted ‚óèature , but from Christ that liveth in me : ‚óènd I am convinced of this by such things ‚óès these . 

1.  I can look on my sins , and find a ‚óèower within me that loathes them , and would crucify them , and be revenged of them ; and it 's the greatest burden of my ‚óège , that I have any thing in me , against the will and glory of so good a God , and which ‚óès displeasing to him , and makes me so unlike unto him . 

2.  I can look at God's Commandments , ‚óènd find a power within me agreeing with them , so that they are the very law of my mind ; I accounted them all holy , just and good ; and they are for that reason precious to me , because they are against my sins : and I judge it the best work that I can do , to be doing the Will of God revealed in these good Commandments . 

3.  I can look upon the world , and upon the Kingdoms and Country where I live ; and I judge it the greatest happiness and glory of a Nation , which I most pray for , and in my place and calling contend for , to have all places filled with the Name , and Kingdom , and Will of Jesus Christ . 

4.  I look upon men , and I see amongst them a company who are separared from the world , and differ from the world , and are of another spirit , who appear and shine in the image and likeness of the most holy God , in whom there is a sweet agreement betwixt their lives and the Scriptures , and the life of Jesus Christ is manifested in them . Now my heart doth judge these the best people in the world , and to be far more excellent than their carnal Neighbours ; I love and delight in them , and desire living and dying to be found with my heart joined to them . Poor soul ! i‚óè thou canst find these things sincerely in thee , thou art certainly a part of Christ and shalt go in peace from thy deathbed to thy head , to sit together with him in heavenly places . 

Duty 4.  If thou find on Scripture grounds that thy sins are pardoned , and thy peace is made with God , than improve‚óè thy experience in a spiritual triumph over all the enemies of thy Salvation : Say to Death that stands daring an‚óè staring thee in the face , OH death , where i‚óè thy sting ? And Death must answer in effect thus : When Christ laid down his life , I lost my sting ; but Christ took up again his life , but I could never take up again my sting . 

Ask the grave , OH grave , where is thy victory ? The grave must answer : I lost the victory , when Christ rose again from me ; and I must needs give up thy precious Body , when it is called for at the resurrection of the just . 

Look on the Devils , and see how Christ hath spoilt these principalities and powers , and triumphed openly over them , Col. 2.15 . and now rejoice thou in the spoil : Let that be spiritually fulfilled in thee , which was spoken , Isa . 33.23 . The lame take the prey : Death and Devils are spoilt by Christ ; and the poor , weak , sick Christian takes and triumphs in the prey : So that because of this , Let the weak say , I am strong , Joel 3.10 . This may make thee even to forget thy aches and pains , so that thou shalt not say , I am sick , because the Lord hath forgiven thy iniquities , Isa . 33.24 . 

Duty 5.  Having thus seen a settlement of my soul and body to all eternity , make a godly , conscientious and seasonable settlement of thy outward estate ; this aught to be done , if it be not done before , and if thou art in a capacity to do it : This was part of Isaiah his message to Hezekiah on his sickbed , Isai . 38.1 . Set thy house in order , for thou shalt die , and not live . Now in making thy Will , be ruled by this principle : Be sure that thy will be ruled by the Will of God , that so thy last Will and Testament , which is the signification of thy will , may make it appear that thy will is in subjection to the Will of God ; and that thou dost Gods Will , when thou makest thy own william For this purpose , observe these three Directions . 

1.  If thou hast got any thing unjustly , take order , so far as is possible , to make restitution ; do not die in injustice , to go with a curse to hell thyself , and to leave the curse of God behind thee upon thy family . 

2.  Be full of love and faithfulness to thy Relations . Christ himself is our pattern herein , who when he was nigh unto death , commended the care of his Mother to his beloved Disciple , John 19.27 . then saith he to his disciple , Behold thy mother . Let thy last Will and Testament witness that thou diest in conjugal love to thy wife ; Give her of the fruit of her hands , prov. 31. ult . endeavour to make thy poor widow's life as comfortable as thou canst : and although I advice not husbands to leave power in the hands of their wives to wrong and defraud their poor fatherless children ; for sad experience witnesseth , that many widows are so careful to get themselves husbands , that they grow careless of their poor children ; yet however leave no tie upon her to bind her from after-marriage ; seeing God hath made her free , do not thou leave her bound . 

Again , provide so for thy children , that there be neither want , nor strife , nor emulation among them : and though I advice to nothing to prejudice the first-borns birthright , yet I must witness against it as the great sin of many Parents , that are so ambitious to set up their Families , that they highly advance the elder brothers , and often leave the younger to be as poor as beggars , or as bad as thiefs . 

3.  Die in dear love to the Church of God , and to the poor , that so far as thou art able , thy last Will and Testament may savour of good will towards them . It is the wickedness of many , that they seek to make a Monopoly of the world , by engrossing to themselves and their families , and restraining the good and use of it from others : but every man ( keeping to the rules of justice ) should dispose of his estate so , as may make it most useful for God's glory , and to be a blessing unto man : And therefore consider , that if thou expectest when thou diest to be received into the everlasting habitation of God's poor in the other world , let their lives be made somewhat more comfortable by thee in this world . 

Duty 6.  Use all lawful means to recover thy health ; though thou art ready to die , yet it 's thy duty to endeavour to live ; thy life is Gods , and he hath bound thee to keep it for him till he call for it ; and thou art the Church's servant , and must not by thy sinful neglect defraud her of her right : thou hast yet need to mortify sin , and to grow in grace , and to strengthen thy assurance of Salvation , and to lay up more treasures in heaven ; and thou oughtest to use all lawful means to preserve thy life for these ends : grudge not therefore thyself wholesome and fit diet : send for a skilful and careful Physician , and depend upon the God of thy life in the use of them . To conclude , be ruled by this Principle : When life is most sweet , be willing to die ; and when life is most bitter , be wiling to live : without this , a man life's to himself , and dies to himself . 

Duty 7.  Bear thy Visitation patiently . The Apostle pleads for this duty , though in a more general case , Heb. 12.9 . Furthermore , we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them revence ; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the father of spirits , and live ? As it is a most unchild-like temper in children , to carry themselves stubbornly under their father's rod ; so it is very unchildlike for God's children to carry themselves stubbornly under the correction of their heavenly Father : therefore yield thyself in patient subjection to thy Father under all his chastisements . Now because patience is such a necessary , seasonable and proper Duty for a sick man , I shall press this Exhortation with some Motives , and then by some Directions teach you how to be patient . 

I shall use these five Motives . 

Mot. 1.  Now is a special season , wherein you have great need of patience , Heb. 10.36 . for the greater our afflictions are , the greater is our need of patience : now every affliction is greater , by how much it comes nearer to a man's life ; so that a man better bears afflictions in his Estate or Friends , then in his own Body : and therefore there never appeared a want of Jobs patience , till his body was so sore visited . Besides , there are many afflictions accompany sickness , which make our condition more grievous , and patience more necessary : as for example , our enemies are now apt to triumph in our misery . Thus they did by David , Psal . 41.8 . An evil disease say they , cleaveth fast unto him ; and now that he lieth , he shall rise up no more : So that we have need of patience to bear the insulting and upbraid of our enemies : our friends also may be now estranged from us . Thus they were from Job and Heman , Psal . 88.8 . and David complains of this , Psal . 38.11 . My lovers and my friends stand a loof from my sore , and my kinsmen stood afar off : Nay , our dearest relations sometimes deal unkindly with us in this condition : This did aggravate Jobs misery , Job 19.17 . My breath is strange to my wife , though I entreated her for the children's sake of my own body : I begged of her , Good wife , do not forsake me now , but remember our poor children , which are gone , which were the sweet pledges of our Matrimonial Love : Yet for all this ( saith he ) she was so nice , that she could not endure to come near my breath , which did stink , being corrupted by my disease . so that we have upon all these , and diverse other considerations , great need of patience . 

Mot. 2.  Your patience will prove you to be complete Christians . Thus the Apostle pleads , Jam. 1.4 . Let patience have her perfect work , that you may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing . Beloved , many seem to be good Christians till they come to passive obedience ; but then they cannot endure to be wronged , or provoked , or to suffer losses , or pains in body , etc.  Now here is a want in Christiany ; and it is better want any where , then be wanting in godliness : but when a man can with patience bear all sufferings , he is a perfect entire Christian , and wants nothing , because he can patiently want every thing . 

Mot. 3.  Thy bearing thy visitation patiently , makes thy suffering to be a suffering for the sake of Christ : Perhaps thou mayst think , O if I had the honour to suffer banishment , imprisonment , yea death itself for the sake of Christ , how patiently could I hear it ! But consider the answer which Cyprian makes to this objection , which the Christians did object in his days in a time of great sickness , Non sanguinem vestrum Deus quaerit , sed fidem : God seeks not your blood , but your faith . If you did suffer for Christ , it is not your blood and your death that pleaseth God , but the faith and patience which you exercise in your sufferings ; and by these thou mayst exceedingly please God in this Visitation : And consider further , that a man doth not only suffer for Christ's sake , when he suffers for the name and truth of Christ ; though I confess it is ordinarily taken in that sense , yet there is another way of suffering for the sake of Christ , which is indeed a clearer argument of sincerity than the former , that is , when we suffer patiently for the sake of Christ's Will ; so the reason of our patience and submission is , because our visitation comes from the Will of Jesus Christ ; and indeed this demonstrates that the same graces , and the same reasons , which make thee so patient under this visitation , would make thee run with patience through all the suffering which thou shouldst be called unto for the sake of Christ . 

Mot. 4.  This puts a great grace upon a Christian , to lie quietly and patiently under the hand of God in sickness . David gives a relation of his sweet temper in the exercise of this grace , Psal . 131.2 . Surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother : my soul is even as a weaned child : As a weaned child eats , and drinks , and plays , and sleeps quietly without the breasts ; so David was obedient , and quiet , and patient , and teachable under all God's dispensations : I tell you , in the midst of all nasty and loathsome diseases , this spirit of patience puts a beauty and glory upon the very body of a Christian . Tertullian elegantly expresseth the comely carriage of a patient Christian under his sufferings thus : His countenance is calm and pleasant ; his face smooth , not wrinkled with sorrow or anger ; his eyelids let down in a cheerful manner ; his eyes cast down not with misery , but humility ; his mouth sealed with silence , etc. De patientia , cap. 15.  

Last Mot. This will be a sure proof to thee , that all thy sicknesses and misery will end in heaven , Heb. 6.12 . That ye be not slothful , but followers of them , who through faith and patience inherit the promises . Observe , all the glory of heaven is laid up in the promises ; and the Patriarches , Prophets , Apostles , Martyrs and Saints which have died in all ages , are now in heaven inheriting the promises ; they are enjoining that happiness which was promised to them in the Scriptures : but how came they to inherit these promises ? why through faith and patience . Now we have the same promises made to us , which they do now inherit : but how shall we come to inherit the same promises ? those Saints are possessed of glory , yonder they live and reign ; but how shall we do to come among them ? why be followers of them ; they are gone a little before you ; away after them , follow their steps through faith and patience , and you shall with them inherit the promises , Heb. 10.36 . ye have need of patience , that after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise . 

So much for the Motives . Now that you may practise this Duty , observe these f‚óève following Directions . 

1.  Labour by patience to „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ under the Rule and „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ grace's , Luk. 2‚óè . ‚óè . 9 . „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ ye your ‚óèortss „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ ‚óè‚óèe sweet possession and „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ ; by this gra‚óè‚óè „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ ‚óèis spirit , prov. 15.32 . Beloved , when the body is troubled , it 's an hard thing to rule the soul , to keep the affections , passions , thoughts , words , looks , actions in their place ; much covetousness , pride , unbelief , anger , and discontent , are apt to work , and disturb , and displace the soul at such a time : Now a patient man bears off his troubles by the strength of his graces , and the strength of all grace's work in patience ; he believes patiently , hope's patiently , and lies patiently under the will of God , loving and rejoicing in him ; so that patience keeps the soul from sinking , and it keeps corruption from rising , and keeps all graces working , so that the heart is full of duty , when it is full of patience ; and hereby the heart is established and settled in a holy , even , cheerful and obedient frame under the will of God.  

2.  Be patient in obedience to the will of God ; for it cannot be true patience , except thou bear thy affliction patiently for this reason , because it comes from the will of God : I know a sickness is not a thing itself which a natural will should choose ; but when God signifies that it 's his will that thou shouldst be visited , then here comes in the work of patience , to deny thy own will , whereby thou wast willing to have ease , and health , and life ; and to say , I am willing to go into a sickbed , or deathbed , to fulfil the Will of God. We have our Saviour's example for this ; he was innocently willing to avoid the sufferings by his created Human Will ; but looking upon them as coming from the Will of his Father , he submits his will to his Fathers ; saying , Mat. 26.39 . Not as I will , but as thou wilt . So a child of God may say , I am willing to have my health and life , to live in the world with my Friends and Relations , and to be a blessing to the Church of God : but if it be God's Will that I shall be sick and dead , let me die to fulfil the Will of God , rather than live to fulfil my own william  

3.  Humble and abase yourselves under the Hand of God in your Visitation , 1 Pet. 5.6 . Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God. See what a mighty Hand of God is upon thee , and humble thyself under it ; the humblest Christians are always the patientest Christians . it 's observable , that the reason of Jobs impatience , was his too high thoughts of himself , and his too low thoughts of God : and therefore observe how God pleads with him , Job 38.2 , 3.  Who is this that darkens counsel by ‚óèordss without knowledge ? What prating ‚óèellow is this , that by his ignorant talk darkens my Wisdom , and Justice , and Pro‚óè‚óèdence ? Because thou didst challenge me „Äà‚óä„Äâ dispute with thee , and didst promise to answer me , Job 13.22 . Gird up now thy ‚óè‚óèynss like a man ; for I will demand of thee , ‚óènd answer thou me . Now when God had „Äà‚óä„Äâ the following words demonstrated his ‚óè‚óèfinite power and wisdom in the works ‚óèf Creation and Providence , Job is thereupon so deeply convinced of the Majesty ‚óèf God , and of the vanity of himself , that ‚óèe resolves for ever after to be humble , pa‚óèient and silent , Job 40.4 , 5.  Behold , I am ‚óèile , what shall I answer thee ? I will lay ‚óèy hand upon my mouth . Once have I spoken ( like a fool as I was ) but I will not answer ; yea , twice , but I will proceed no further . 

4.  Consider the desert of thy sins ; it will make thee bear patiently what thou sufferest , to consider what thou deservest . It was a savoury saying of a good man being then tortured with the pain of sickness ; O ( saith he ) this is not Hell. He that believes what Hell is , and knows that he deserves to be there , will see great reason to lie patiently under the greatest pains of the most tormenting sickness , and to resolve with the Prophet , Micah 7.9 . I will bear the indignation of the Lord , because I have sinned against him . 

Lastly , Wait by patience for a comfortable issue out of thy sickness , James 1.4 . Let patience have her perfect work . Some are patient a while , and after fly into passion and discontent : but as long as there is any work for patience , let her have her perfect work , James 5.7 . Be patient , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord Sirs , the Lord is coming , and he will put an end to sickness and death when he comes : Consider what the Lord will do to thy body and soul at his coming , and be patient till his coming ; for when thou meetest him , thou wilt see he did not stay too long . 

it 's observable , that God and his people have both the same end : Thy great end is the glory of God , and the salvation of thyself , and of all God's Church ; and this now is God's end : But God hath set thee thy way to this end , and he hath set and appointed to himself his own way . Now God's way is not as thy way : thou thinkest such and such a way were best to make God glorious , and his Church happy ; but God , he hath a way above ‚óènd contrary to thy way : and so as to this ‚óèase , thou mayst think it is the best way for God's glory , and for thy family , and for ‚óèhy self , for thee to enjoy thy health and ‚óèife , etc. but God's way is to bring thee ‚óèo sickness and death : Well , what must be done in this case ? Answ . Still keep thy heart fixed upon thy glorious end ; and do thou follow thy way of duty , and patiently wait upon , and submit unto God in his way of providence ; and thou shalt find , that at the last Gods working in his way of providence , and thy keeping to thy way of duty , will meet in the same end , viz. God's glory , and thy everlasting salvation . 

Duty 8.  In sickness give good counsel to thy Friends about thee : See how Moses stands over Eternity , and preacheth to the Israelites , Deut. 32.  See also the language of a dying King to his Successor , 1 Chron. 28.9 . thou , Solomon my son , know thou the God of thy Father , and serve him with a perfect heart , and with a willing mind . See again the solemn charge of the dying Apostle to Timothy , 2 Tim. 4.1 , 2.  I charge thee therefore before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , who shall judge the quick and th‚óè dead at his appearing , and his Kingdom Preach the word , be instant in season , out o‚óè season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all patience and long suffering . And you know the farewel-sermon of our dying Lord Joh. 14.15 , 16.  It was a sweet and savoury saying of Hyperius to his little Son tha‚óè stood by his deathbed ; Disce mi fili mandata Domini , & ipse enutriet te : Learn m‚óè child the commandments of the Lord , and he will nourish thee . 

Let thy last words be such that may savour of a heart breathing after the salvation of those that are to come after thee thou art now standing at the end of al‚óè worldly perfections ; thy stomach is almos‚óè closed for ever , thy sleep is even gone for ever ; thou art at the end of all the pleasures of sin , at the end of all worldly enjoyments , of all the Ordinances and duties of this life , and thou hast now but a step to that judgement which will quickly resolve all thy thoughts about thy Eternal Estate : Now thou seest what a vanity man is , what a lie the world is , what a cheat sin is , what a lost wretch an unbeliever is , what a precious Jewel a Saint is , what a treasure grace is , what a pearl the Gospel is , what a Father God is , what a Saviour Christ is , what a place Hell is , what a portion Heaven is : Now thou canst speak of these things with more faith , and heart , and feeling , then ever : thy yoke-fellow , children , brothers , sisters , friends , neighbours , have now more than ever their hearts and ears open to thee ; and who knows what a saving work a savoury word from one that is just in his flight to Eternity may make ! and therefore speak so , as one that earnestly desire's , that the meeting between thee , and all thy sad friends about thee , may be joyful , when you come together next . 

9  Pray earnestly , that as long as thou hast a gasp to breathe , it may appear , that thou hast a spirit to pray . I dare be bold to say , thou mayst gain more good by one spiritual breathing in prayer , than the most prosperous Merchant can by the most successful returns of a whole Age.  

Pray with obedient submission to Gods Will , that he will restore thee to health and life : Beg of God to spare thee a little ; this will sweeten health and life to thee , when it is given as a fruit of prayer , if thou livest ; and it will be a sweet testimony , that thou dost not leave the world in discontent , if thou diest . 

Pray for everlasting salvation : See how many miscarry at death , and what a great crowd of Men and Women will stand at the left hand of Christ at the day of Judgement ; and beg of God , that for his great Names sake , and for the sake of Christ's obedience , thou mayst find mercy at those great days : Let thy Faith and Hope be never so strong , and thy experiences never so sweet , and thy evidences never so clear , yet thou mayst see reason and need enough of these prayers . 

Pray earnestly for the Militant Church , and particularly for that part of it to which thou hast a more special Relation : Believe what a Father , and Head , and Husband , and Saviour , the Church hath ; and what a Body , and Spouse , and Family , the Church is ; and what an everlasting Covenant of Grace there is betwixt God and his Church ; and what a multitude of mighty , subtle , cruel , implacable Devils and men there are against the Church ; and that yet in despite of all , Christ will present it to himself a glorious Church . It is very good on thy sick bed to set this Body , the Church , before thee , to let thy thoughts walk about Zion , and go round about her , and tell the Towers thereof ; and to mark well her Bulwarks , and consider her Palaces , etc. Psal . 48.12 , 13.  And see thyself of this blessed Flock and Family : and so with all thy might pray for this Church . Thus dying Moses cries to God for his Church , Numb . 27.16 , 17.  Let the Lord , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation , which may go out before them , and which may go in before them ; and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd . 

Pray for thy Family , Friends and Relations . The prayer of Cruciger in his sickness is worthy of our imitation : Fac meos Orphanos vasa misericordiae ; Lord , make my poor Orphan's Vessels of Mercy . Beg of God not to charge thy sins upon thy house , and that he will graciously supply the want of thee when thou art gone . 

Pray that thy name , graces , counsel , reproofs , and example , may be blessed , to God's glory , and the good of others ; that by them , even when thou art dead , thou mayst be speaking . 

Pray also for thy enemies : You know the practice of Christ , and Stephen , who almost breathed out their last gasps in prayer for their enemies . Tertullian makes love to enemies , to be a property peculiar to Christians ; saying , Amicos diligere omnium est , inimicos autem solorum Christianorum : All men may love their friends , but none but Christians can love their enemies , ad Scapulum , cap. 1.  Every Christian should be always much in that , which will prove him to be a Christian ; especially now thou art dying , and going to heaven , be found with thy heart filled with love to , and prayer for thy enemies , that thou mayst appear to be a child of thy Father which is in heaven , Mat. 5.45 . Set before thy heart thy most malicious , spiteful , and injurious enemy : consider , he is a man made after the Image of the same God with thyself : consider what the Word threatens against him , and into what a Hell he is falling , and what a blessed instrument he may be , if God would please to convert him ; and labour to find thy soul filled with love and compassion towards him , which will cause in thee strong desires after his everlasting Salvation ; and do thou earnestly offer up these desires by prayer unto God : this will be a sweet testimony of thy integrity , and will be a service of a sweet savour to God in Christ ; and perhaps God may in answer to thy prayers , give eternal life to thy poor miserable enemy . 

Duty 10.  Fasten by faith on some choice place of Scripture : When Mr. John Knox lay dying , he called some about him to read Joh. 17.  For , saith he , there I cast my anchor : and he also called for 1 Cor. 15. and when it was read , he cries , O the sweet and saving comfort which God hath refreshed my soul with , out of this chapter ! and I have heard it reported , that when holy and learned Mr. Blake lay on his deathbed , he fastened on those words , Act. 13.39 . By him all that believe are justified from all things , from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses : And cries out , I 'll die with this , I 'll die with this . Thus I say , Settle thy soul upon some Scripture which settles pardon of sin and salvation upon thee ; this will be a sweet evidence that thou diest in faith : And thus believing the promises whilst thou livest , thou shalt be sure to inherit the promises when thou diest . 

Duty 11.  Be willing in obedience to God to die ; this is to die to the Lord , Rom. 14.18 . I tell you , a man may with courage and resolution burn at a stake , and men burn him to death , because of his profession of the truth of Christ ; and yet this is but the height of hypocrisy , and he may hereby die to himself : And though men may commend him for a Saint , yet God may justly condemn him for an hypocrite : but he that willingly yields himself to die in obedience to God , dies in the Lord , and to the Lord , and graciously offers up his life as a sacrifice of a sweet savour to God in Christ . Consider further , thou dost hereby graciously finish all passive and active obedience ; thou now leavest thy Country , and Estate , and Father , and Mother , and Wife , and Children , to fulfil the will of God. So also , all that thou hast been doing by Prayer , Meditation , Sacraments , Sabbaths , etc. thou willingly yeildest to have finished by death ; thou art heartily willing that the old man of sin be put off by death for ever , and that the new man of holiness be put on for ever : Consider thou hast often prayed to be filled with the likeness and presence of God ; which can never be till death . Christ hath prayed that thou mayst be where he is , that thou mayst see his glory , Joh. 17.24 . and this can never be till thou diest ; therefore , I say , be willing to die : call upon the sad mourners about thee , saying to them as Jacob to Joseph , Gen. 46.30 . Let me die . Dear yoke-fellow , let me die ; sweet children , let me die ; my pleasant Jonathans' , let me die : and turn thy face to God , and say with Simeon , Luk. 2.29 . Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace . 

Lastly , Commend thy soul to God ; this is an act of a Believer , whereby he freely gives up himself to God and Christ as his right and due to glorify and to enjoy him for ever in heaven : Now by giving up thy soul to God , thou givest up thy body too ; for the body will be sure to follow the soul ; if the soul go to hell , the body must go thither too ; if the soul go to heaven , the body must be glorified there too : therefore see God , as it were , standing by thy bedside , saying to thee , My son , give me thy heart : give me thy soul , give it me from sin and self ; give it me from the world and devils ; give it me , for I made it , and bought it , and I will save it : O then give it up , and commend it to God : See the infinite and unchangeable love and mercy of God in Christ to thy soul , and believe that with this love he will graciously and lovingly receive thy soul : and see what God will do with thy soul , in what fullness of holiness , and joy , and glory he will settle it for ever : See that thy soul be such , as thou mayst comfortably commend it unto God ; do not present to him a drunken , ignorant , proud , covetous , unbelieving soul ; but a believing , loving , holy , humble soul : See thy soul clothed with Christ's righteousness , and a‚óè such , give it up to God to be blessed and glorified for ever in Heaven , saying , Father , into thy hands I commit my spirit .
