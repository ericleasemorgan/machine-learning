THE CHARACTER OF A Coffeehouse , etc.  

A Coffeehouse is a Lay-conventicle , Good-fellowship turned Puritan , Ill-husbandry in Masquerade , whither people come , after Toping all day , to purchase , at the expense of their last penny , the repute of sober Companions ; a Rota-room that ( like Noah's Ark ) receives Animals of every sort , from the precise diminutive Band , to the Hectoring Cravat and Cuffs in Folio ; a Nursery for training up the smaller Fry of Virtuosos in confident Tattling , or a Cabal of Kittling Critics that have only learned to Spit and Mew ; a Mint of Intelligence , that to make each man his pennyworth , draws out into petty parcels , what the Merchant receives in Builion : He that comes often saves two pence a week in Gazettes , and has his News and his Coffee for the same charge , as at a three penny Ordinary they give in Broth to your Chop of Mutton ; 't is an Exchange where Haberdashers of Political small wares meet , and mutually abuse each other , and the Public , with bottomless stories , and headless notions ; the Rendezvous of idle Pamphlets , and persons more idly employed to read them ; a High Court of Justice , where every little Fellow in a Chamlet-cloak takes upon him to transpose Affairs both in Church and State , to show reasons against Acts of Parliament , and condemn the Decrees of General Counsels ; 't is impossible to describe it better than the most ingenious of the Latin Poets has done it to our hand , and that so excellently , we cannot but transcribe it : " Unde quod est usquam quamvis Regionibus absit 
" Inspicitur , penetrátque cavas vox omius ad Aures 
" Nocte Diéque patet , Tota est ex Aeresonanti 
" Tota Fremit , Vocésque refert , Iteratque quod Audit , 
" Nulla Quies intus , nullâque silentia parte 
" Nec tamen est Clamour , sed parvae Murmura Vocis 
" Qualia de Pelagi ( si quis procul audiat ) undâ 
" Esse solent , qualemve sonum cum Jupiter atras 
" Increpuit nubes , Extrema Tonitrua reddunt ; 
" Atria Turba tenet , veniunt Leave vulgus , Eun●que 
" Mistáque cum veris passim Commenta vagantur , 
" Millia Rumorum , confusáque verba volutant ; 
" Equibus Hii vacuas Implent sermonibus Aures 
" High narrata feruntaliò , Mensuráque ficti 
" Crescit , & Auditis aliquid novus Adjicit Author 
" Illic Credulitas , Illic temerarius Error 
" Varáque Letitia est , Consternatique Timores 
" Seditióque recens , dubióque Authore Susurri 
" Ipsa quid in Caelo Rerum , Pelagóque geratur 
" Et Tellure videt , Totúmque Inquirit in Orbem . 




Thus strictly Englished . Here all that 's d●ne , though far remote , appears , 
And in close whispers penetrates our ears ; 
As built of Brass , the House throughout resounds , 
Reports things hea●d , and every word rebounds . 
no rest within , nor sil●●c● , yet the noise 
Not loud , but like a hollow murmuring voice ; 
Such as from far by Rolling Waves is sent , 
Or like Jove's fainting Thunder almost spent : 
Hither the idle vulgar come and go , 
Carrying a thousand Rumours to and from ; 
With stale reports some listening ears do fill , 
Some coin fresh tales , in words that vary still ; 
Lies mixed with Truth , all in the telling grows , 
And each Relator adds to what he knows : 
Here dwells rash error , light credulity , 
Sad panic fears , joys built on vanity ; 
New raised sedition , secret whisper , 
Of unknown Authors , and of doubtful things : 
All Acts of Heaven and Earth it boldly views , 
And through the spacious World inquires for News . 




The Room stinks of Tobacco worse than Hell of Brimstone , and is as full of smokes ●s their Heads that frequent it , whose humours are as various as those of Bedlam , and their discourse ost-times as Heathenish and dull as their Liquor ; that Liquor , which by its looks and taste , you may reasonably guests to be Pluto's Diet-drink ; that Witches tipple out of dead men's Skulls , when they ratify to Belzebub their Sacramental Vows . 

This St●gian-puddle-seller , was formerly notorious for his ill-favoured Cap , that Aped a Turban , and in Conjunction with his Antichristian face , made him appear perfect Turk : But of late his Wife being grown acquainted with Callants , and the provocative virtue of Chocolet , he finds a Broad-brimed Hat more necessary : When he comes to fill you a Dish , you may take him for Guy Faux with a dark Lantern in 's hand , for no sooner can you taste it , but it scalds your throat , as if you had swallowed the Gunpowder-treason : though he seem never so demure , you cannot properly call him Pharisee , for he never washes either out or inside of his pots or dishes , till they be as black as an Usurer's Conscience ; and then only scraping off the contracted Soot , makes use of it , in the way of his Trade , instead of Coffee-powder ; their taste and virtue being so near of Kin , he dares defy the veriest Coffee-critick to distinguish them : Though he be no great Traveller , yet he is in continual motion , but 't is only from the fire side to the Table , and his tongue goes infinitely faster than his feet , his grand study being readily to echo an answer to that threadbare question , What News have you Master ? then with a grave whisper ( yet such as all the Room may hear it ) he discovers some mysterious Intrigue of State told him last night by one that is Barber to the Tailor of a mighty great Courtiers man , relating this with no lesle formality than a young Preacher delivers his first Sermon , a sudden Hickup surprises him , and he is forced twenty times to break the thread of his Tale with such necessary Parenthesis' , Wife , sweep up those loose Corns of Tobacco , and see the Liquor boil not over : He holds it as part of his Creed , that the Great Turk is a very good Christian , and of the Reform Church , because he drinks Coffee , and swears that Pointings for celebrating its virtues in doggerel deserves to be Poet Laureate : yet is it not only this hot Hell-broth that he sells , for never was Mountebank surnisht with more variety of poisonous drugs , than he of liquors , Ten and Aromatic for the sweet-toothed Gentleman , Betony and Rosade for the addleheaded Customer , Back recruiting Chocolet for the Consumptive Gallant , Herefordshire Redstreak made of rotten apples at the three Cranes , true Brunswick-mum brewed at S. Katherine's , and Ale in penny Mugs , not so big as a Tailor's Thimble . 

As you have a hodgepodge of Drinks , such too is your Company , for each man seems a Leveller , and ranks and files himself as he list's , without regard to degrees or order ; so that oft you may see a silly Fop , and a worshipful Justice , a gripping Rock , and a grave Citizen , a worthy Lawyer , and an errand Pickpocket , a Reverend Nonconsormist , and a Canting Mountebank ; all blended together , to compose an Oglio of Impertinence . 

If any Pragmatic , to show himself witty or eloquent , begin to talk high , presently the further Tables are abandoned , and all the rest flock round ( like smaller birds to admire the gravity of Madge-howlet ) They listen to him a while with their mouths , and let their Pipes go out , and Coffee grow cold , for pure zeal of attention , but o' th' sudden fall all a yelping at once with more noise , but not half so much harmony as a Pack of Beagles on the full Cry , to still this bawling , Upstarts 

Captain All-man-sir , the man of mouth , with a face as blustering as that of Aeolus and his four Sons in Painting , and a voice louder than the speaking Trumpet , he begins you the story of a Sea-fight ; and though he never were further by water than the Bear-garden , or Cuckolds-haven , yet having pyrated the names of Ships and Captains , he persuades you himself was present , and performed Miracles ; that he waded Knee-deep in blood on the upper Deck , and never thought serenade to his Mistress , so pleasant as the Bullets whistling ; how he stopped a Vice-admiral of the Enemies under full sail , till she was boarded , with his single arm instead of Grappling Irons , and puffed out with his breath a Fire-ship that fell foul on them . All this he relates sitting in a Cloud of Smoak , and belching so many common Oaths to vouch it , you can scarce guests whether the real Engagement , or his Romancing account of it , be the more dreadful : However , he concludes with railing at the Conduct of some Eminent Officers , ( that perhaps he never saw ) and protests , had they taken his advice at the Council of War , not a Sail had escaped us . 

He is no sooner out of breath , but another begins a Lecture on the Gazet , where finding several Prizes taken , he gravely observes , if this Trade hold , we shall quickly rout the Dutch Horse and Foot by Sea : He nicknames the Polish Gentlemen where ever he meets them , and inquires , whether Gayland and Taffaletta be Lutherans or Calvinists : Stilo Novo he interprets a vast new Style or Turn-pike erected by his Electoral Highness on the borders of Westphalia to keep Mounsieur Turenes Cavalray from falling on his retreating Troops ; He takes words by the sound without examining their sense : Morea he believes to be the Country of the Moors , and Hungary a place where famine always keeps her Court , nor is there any thing more certain , than that he made a whole Roomful of Fops , as wise as himself , spend above two hours in searching the Map for Aristocracy and Democracy , not doubting but to have found them there , as well as Dalmatia and Croatia . 

Next Signior Poll takes up the Cudgels , that speaks nothing but Designs , Projects , Intriqus , and Experiments , One of those in the old Comedian , Plautus , Sciunt id quod in Aurem Rex Reginae dixerit , Quod Juno confabulata est cum Jove , Sciunt quae neque futura neque facta sunt , tamen illi sciunt , etc.  All the Counsels of the Germane Diet , the Romish Conclave , and Turkish Divan , are as well known to him as his Laundresses Smock . He kens all the Cabals of the Court to a hairs breadth , and ( more than an hundred of us do , ) which Lady is not painted ; you would take his mouth for a Limbeck , it distils his words so niggardly , as if he was loath to enrich you with lies , of which he has yet more plenty than Fox , Stowe , and Holinshed bound up together ; He tells you of a Plot to let the Lion's loose in the Tower , and then blow it up with white-powder ; of five hundred and fifty Jesuits all mounted on Dromedaries seen by Moonshine on Hampsteadheath , and a terrible design hatched by the College of Douai , to drain the narrow Seas and bring Popery over dry shod ; besides he has a thousand inventions dancing in his brain-pain ; an Advice-boat on the Stocks , that shall go to the East-indieses , and come back again in a Fortnight , a trick to march underwater , and bore holes through the Dutch-ships Keel with Augurs , and sink them , as they ride at Anhor , and a most excellent pursuit to catch Sunbeams , for making the Ladies new fashioned Towers , that Poets may no more be damned for telling lies about their Curls and Tresses . 

But these are puny Pugs , the Arch-devil , wherewith this Smoke-hole is haunted , is the Town-wit , one that plays Rex where ever he comes , and makes as much hurry as Robin Goodfellow of old amongst our Granam's Milk-bouls ; He is a kind of a Squib on a Rope ; a meteor composed of Self-conceit and noise , that by blazeing and crackling engages the wonder of the ignorant , till on a sudden he vanishes and leaves a stench , if not infection behind him ; he is too often the stain of a good Family , and by his debauched life blots the noble Coat of his Ancestors , A wild unbacked Colt , whose brains are not half coddled , indebted for his clotheses to his Tailor , and for his wit ( such as it is ) to his Company : The School had no sooner ' dued him with a few superficial besprinklings , but his Mother's indulgence posted him to Town for Genteeler breeding , where three or four wild Companions , half a dozen bottles of Burgundy , two leaves of Leviathan , a brisk encounter with his Landlord's Glasswindowes , the charms of a little Miss , and the sight of a new Play dubbed him at once both a Wit and a Hero , ever since he values himself mainly for understanding the Town , and indeed knows most things in it , that are not worth knowing : The two Poles whereon all his discourses turn are Atheism and Bawdry ; Bar him from being profane or obscene , and you cramp his Ingenuity , which forthwith Flags and becomes useless , as a meet Common Lawyer when he has crossed the Channel . 

He is so refractory to Divinity that Morality itself cannot hold him , he affirms human Nature knows no such things as principles of Good and evil , and will swear all women are whores , though his Mother and Sister both stand by : Whatever is sacred or serious he seeks to render Ridiculous , and thinks Government and Religion fit objects for his idle and fantastic Buffonery , his humour is proud and assuming , as if he would palliate his ignorance by Scoffing at what he understands not , and therefore with a pert and pragmatique scorn depreciates all things of nobler moment , but most passionately affects pretty a lamode words , And is as covetous of a New Song or Air , as an Antiquary of Cato's Statue with ne'er an arm , and but half a nose , These keep him always employed , and fill up the Grotescoes of his conversation , whilst with a stately Gallantry once in every half hour he Combs out his Wig , Carreens his breeches , and new marshals his Garniture , to the Tune of Methinks the poor Town has been troubled too long . 

His mind used to whistle up and down in the levitieses of Fancy , and effeminated by the childish Toying of a rampant imagination finds itself indispoled for all solid employment , especially the serious exercises of Piety and Virtue , which begets an aversion to those Lovely Beauties , and that prompts him on all occasions to expose them as ridiculous and vain : Hence by degrees he comes to abuse Sacred Scripture , makes a mock of eternal Flames , Joque on the venerable Mysteries of Religion , and in fine , scoff at that All Glorious and Tremendous Mayesty before whom his brother Wits below tremble ; 't is true he will not confess himself Atheist , yet in his heart the Fool hath said it , and boasts aloud that he holds his Gospel from the Apostle of Malmsbury , though it is more than probable he ne'er read , at least understood ten leaves of that unlucky Author ; Talk of Witches and you Tickle him , speak of Spirits and he tells you he knows none better than those of Wine , name but Immaterial Essence , and he shall flout at you as a dull Fop incapable of sense , and unfit for Conversation ; Nor is he ever better pleased than when he can here hedge in some young raw Divine to Bulbait with scurrility and all kind of profanchess . 

By means of some small scraps of learning matched with a far greater stock of Confidence , a voluble Tongue , and bold delivery , he has the ill-luck to be celebrated by the vulgar ; for a man of Parts , which opinion gains credit to his Insolences , and sets him on further extravigances to maintain his Title of a Wit by continuing his practice of Fooling , whereas all his mighty parts are summed up in this Inventory . Imprimis , A peddling way of Fancy , a Lucky hit at Quibbling , now and then an odd metaphor , a conceited Irony , a ridiculous Simile , a wild fetch , an unexpected Inference , a Minick Gesture , a pleasing knack in humouring a Tale , and lastly an irresistible Resolution to speak last , and never be dashed out of Countenance : 



By these Arts dexterously managed he engrosses a vast Repute , The grave Citizen calls him shrewd man , and notable He adpiece , The Ladies ( we mean the things so called of his acquaintance ) vote him a most accomplished Gentleman , and the Blades swear he is a Walking Comedy , the only Merry Andrew of the Age , that scatters Wit wherever he comes , as Beggars do Lice , or Muskcats perfumes , and that nothing in Nature and all that can compare with him . 

You would think he had got the Lullian Art , for he speaks Extempore on all subjects , and ventures his words without , the Relief of Sense to second them , his thoughts start from his imagination , and he never trouble's himself to Examine their decency , or solidity by Judgement . To discourse him seriously is to read the Ethics to a Monkey , or make an Oration to Cal●gula's' Horse , whence you can only expect a wee-hee or Jadish spurn ; after the most convincing Arguments , if he can but muster up one plausible ●●que you are routed , For he that understood not your Logic , apprehends his dro●● , and though Syllogysmes may be answered , yet Jests and loud laughter can never be confuted , but have more sway to degrade things with the ●●thi●ki●g crou● , than demonstrations ; There being a Root of envy in too many Men , that invites them to applaud that which Exposes and villifies what they cannot comprehend ; He pretends grea● skill in curing the Tetters and Ringworms of State , but blows in the sores till they Rankle with his poisonous breath , he shoots libels with his forked tongue at his Superiors ●nd abusest his dearest Friends , choosing to forfeit his neck to the Gibbet , or his shoulders to the Batoon rather than lose the driest of his idle Quibbles ; In brief he is the Jack-pudding of Society , a fleering Buffoon , a better kind of Ape in the judgement of all Wisemen , but an incomparable Wit in his own . 

Thus have we led you from Board to Board , like the fellow in the Tower , to show you strange Beasts wherewith this place is sometimes frequented . To take now a farewell view of the House will be difficult , since 't is always shifting Scenes and like OH Brazile ( the Enchanted Island ) seldom appears twice in a posture ; The wax c●●dles burning , and low devout whispers sometimes strike a kind of Religious Awe , whilst the modish Gallant swears so oft by jesu , an Ignorant Catholic would take it for a Chapel , and think he were saying our Lady's Psalter ; In some places the Organs speak it a Music Room , at others a pair of Tables and draught b●ard , a small gaming house ; on a sudden it turns Exchange , or a Warehouse for all sorts of Commodities , where fools are drawn in by inch of Candle , as we betray and carch Larks with a Glass ; The Bully - Rock makes it his Bubbling pond , where he angel's for Fops , singles out his man , insinuates an acquaintance , offers the wine , and at next Tavern sets upon him with , high Fullums , and plucks him : The Ingeniosi use it for an after Rehearsal , where they bring Plays to Repetition , sift each Scene examine every uncorrected Line , and damn beyond the fury of the Rota , whilst the incognito Poet out of an overweening affection to his Infant Wit , steals in muffled up in his Cloak , and slily Evesdrops like a mendicant Mother to praise the Prettyness of the Babe she has newly pawmed on the Parish . 

But 't is time to be gone , who knows what Magic may be a working , For , behold ! the Coffee-powder settles at the bottom of our dish in form of a most terrible Saracens Head. For a parting blow then give us leave to unbend a little , and say , 

A Coffeehouse is a Phanatique Theatre , a Hothouse to flux in for a clapped understanding , a Sympathetical Cure for the Gonorrhoea of the Tongue , or a refined Bawdy-house , where Illegitimate Reports are got in close Adultery between Lying lips and Itching Ears .
