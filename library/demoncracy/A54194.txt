One sheet , or , if you will a winding sheet for the good old cause , in order to a decent funeral , in case of a second death .

A winding sheet , &c.  

I would not have any to imagine that my design is to expose this sheet to public view , as a trophy of the pretended good old cause its resurrection ; neither would i have it do penance therein , lest the products of its sanguine complexion , should prove worse than menses profluvium , and consequently leave such an illutable stain , that instead of a sheet , it should deservedly be called pannum menstrualem ; but my intention , rather is to have it in a readiness at the time of its funeral solemnities ; for it is much suspected , that though our new imagined commonwealth May have twins struggle in its womb , yet that it will at last only bring forth a single person ( Which single product , ( The relics being more dangerous than Mola in utero ) May well cause the death of the mother ) for the •ffecting of which there will not be wanting such mercenary midwives , as will put to their helping hands , for the production of any thing though never so monstrous . Now what greater monster can be produced , than a new protector of another family and interest than what we have already ? But when this tympany of pride and ambition is swollen to the height , we shall have the bowels of our good old cause break into a protectorship , or some other title equivalent , and more tyrannical . on p. was as much for this good old cause as our new pretenders , till he saw an opportunity of settling himself in the saddle , and then the keepers of the liberty of E•gland Might lead his horse , but death dismounting this champion , his son according to the humble petition and advice assumed his father's room , to whom ( As is obvious enough ) addresses were made from most counties and corporations in England ; looking upon him as their lawful and supreme governor ( The family of the Stewarts being extirpated by these continual new modellers , ) but astra regunt homines , and m•• being most predominant , at that very time when the sign was in the stomach , down goes Richard without an aspect of opposition . It is very probable , that had his little finger been heavier than his father's loins , he had not so easily been heaved out ; for similis simili gaudet , and one oppressor would help to maintain another , especially whilst their interest run parallel ; but he seeming , to decline oppression , oppressors decline him , and make bold to practise that in their own names , which they cannot have licence to act under the protection of another , so that now every private soldier aspires to the dignity of dux omnium malorum , and blushes not to affront such , as maintain them and their blush coloured coats . 

But it seems the days of mourning are over , and their black buttons , will no longer put them in mind of their old benefactor ; the old king-killing cause standing in competition with his posterity , so that now 't is as bad to be a protectorian , as ' twas in the days of yore to be a cavalier . 

And thus are we emptied from vessel to vessel , and every day more and more slaves to our own countrymen , which is as base in us to suffer , as 't is in them to impose : and yet all must be done machivilian like under a pretence of religion , and the liberties and privileges of the persons , when as dally experience teacheth us , that nothing less is intended , every plain countryman , being so far become a politition , as that he can easily discern the face of these fallacies in the glass of his own woes , and geographer like will give you a shrewd description of most of the highways , at Westmister , in which though he never wrought or travelled , yet he hath faith enough to believe , that they are well mended in time of year of a long parliament where there hath not heretofore wanted workmen , that would take more than ordinary pains in the pit• of other men's p•cke•ss , so that they Might save their own soil . 

And seeing they have an opportunity offered of making hay whilst the sun shines , let us go into the shade that have nothing else to do , but to sing solamen miseris &c. which doleful ditty is the only solace as i know now extant , and is like to continue till we turn our swords into ploughshares , and our spears into pruning hooks ; which is not like to come to pass , whilst some of us are so prone to dissensions , that we must needs create disturbances in the nation , on purpose to render the sword useful and necessary : whereas we were in a fair way of safety , and Might very well have put ourselves into a posture of defence according to our old method , without that intolerable and needless burden of a constant army , which would be insupportable to any but ass' backs . 

But we see customs in martial affairs , as well as law , are not so easily broken , where uses are transferred ipso facto into poss•ssion , without help of the statute of 27.  H 8 , and a piece of a long parliament feoff•s in trust , which are as conduit pipes ; i cannot say to lead the uses , because the uses lead them ; but however they serve to convey the sweet honey from the laborious bee to the idle drones , and if themselves get a taste by the way , 't is only in correspondence to the proverb , that 't is an ill cook that will not lick his own fingers . 

But no more of that least i should set them on a stomach , that never had an appetite , for we have taskmasters enough who will expect their tale of bricks , though they allow no straw , and will exact taxes , though they distract trading ; who , so that they May make themselves great , care not how despicable , or to what extremities they expose others : but sure such have little reason to promise themselves safety , in their private cabins , when the ship is in danger of sinking , or to dream of a perpetuity in that , wherein others have had so small a continuance , the wheel of fortune being apt to turn , when it stands most steady : our late trans•ctionss testify as much , and May tend to the setting the right spoke uppermost . 

't is an undeniable maxim in divinity ; that whatsoever is of God shall stand : and most true it is , si deus nobiscum quis contra nos ! but yet he May suffer many things which he doth not allow , and then they must needs fall ; the pleasant success not deciphering the goodness of a cause , though it be never so old : for i never thought good and old correlatives , because i have often observed that the older the worse , and we all know that a thing relinquished and forsaken , being new swept and garnished , is fit for the reception of more devils than ever . 

I must really confess that i am so much , what i profess myself in the front of this sheet ( And i wish for quietness sake we were all of the same mind ) that for the welfare of my native country , i could think a republic good , so that it did not degenerate from a commonwealth , and a protector better , so he parted not with that like a fool , which some say ( His father got like a knave , & a King best of all , that title being most agreeable to our laws & nation ) so he were not a tyrant & nullified all good votes , with his negative voice , or stand so much upon his prerogative till he loses his place : but from a democracy libera nos domine , that our parliaments May be no longer over awed with swords , like a dog with a cudgel , nor take any more such strong potions , as so purge out the members instead of the humours , which must needs render them an imperfect body , not worthy the name of the people's representatives , but rather the stalking horses of some preticular persons , to catch their prey the more easily . 

We use to say of two evils the least is to be chosen : i wish our new create parliament May observe the same method , and seeing in this juncture of aff•ireses , they could do no less than what they have done : i hope that in their progress they will make choice of aristocracy , rather than an oligarchy , that an executive power ( Seeing it May not be in one ) May be committed to a few of the best , though not for the present of the strongest , and that such whose breeding and parts makes them only guilty of multilequence , May not be impeached by bones only rattling with magnanimity , which have nothing in them but the downright language of the sword , whose ignorance makes them despise that which they understand not , and whose covetousness makes them desire that which others possess , who delight in nothing less than peace , because it is no time for plunder , and care not what confusions they introduce , so they produce their profit and keep the nation still ( Monster like ) with the tail where the head should stand , which sight hath cost every English man a vast deal more , than many a show that is not worth two pence : i speak not this to extenuate the honour due to martial discipline , which May tend much to the glory of a nation , nor to derogate from the worthiness of such martigons whose merits May sufficiently manifest that my speech is not intended of them , though it be in some sort directed to them , only to this end that it May the more conspicuously appear that they have drawn the sword for their countries good , by being willing to lay it down for their advantage ; and as opportunity shall offer itself , to send those mercenaries under their command ( That will fight on any side for 6. d. odds ) to their quondam employments , whose desire is only to make a trade of war , and to live upon the ruins of others , being not willing to be accounted non-proficients under their late grand tutor , who was so well experienced in the game at put ; that by the advantage of a few spots , cunningly rendered the King an inconsiderable card ; and these illegitimate births of that corrupted parent are grown to that maturity that they are ever ready to run the hazard of a forcible entry , and in imitation of their old gamester put honest men out of doors , though they have nothing but a knave to show for 't . But we are now at one and thirty , a game that ( Without disparagement ) May be played at a council table , where if the gamesters be not self-seekers , this miserable cheated nation May be the greater winners . 

But now to turn to our good old cause , which being new come to town , May justly take exceptions , that i have been so long averse , & not exercised towards her ladyships those common civilities , that are usual to all strangers , as to solicit their stay , though they never desire it , &c.  but i must beg an excuse , not being bred up in the academy of compliments ; therefore not apt to flatter , neither can i speak ironically , though i have learned the figure , being more apt to Tom tell-truths dialect , and to speak what i think . But to tell you true , and which is a bad omen , there are so many Anabaptiss , Familists , S••kerss , Quakers , cum multis aliis , that rejoice at this new guest , that i thought my entertainment would not be acceptable ; and another notorious company of gotamites , which notwithstanding i had almost forgot , viz. our church antagonists , that cannot endure the sight of a holy sister in a steeplehouse , but forsooth they must have a convenient meeting place , where they May mingle together in friendship to beget reformations . These senseless brood of hypocrites , or ( At best ) blind zealots , together withal the spurious issue of Jesuitical impostors ; bearing , as one saith in another case ) a sacred hatred to whatever is comely and decorous , do in a perpetual scorn to it distorted all their actions to the contrary mode , applauding themselves only in an unlimited liberty , and of doing whatever either their fond or foul imaginations suggest to them . As for their outward garb , 't is a cloak of religion , lined thorough with fair hypocrisy which Irishman like , is never off in the basest employments ; their conscience they carry in their pockets loco crumenae , which they can stretch upon all covetous occasions , even to the reception of all revenues , that tend to the encouragement , either of learning or religion . But to hang by these idiots , let us wish this good old cause better favourites , that seeing there is such fair pretences we May see some performances equivalent , and that those in authority May more regard the public than their private commodity : that so the good persons of this nation May be as much satisfied with the effects of this change , as they are for the present discontented . That a learned and godly ministry May be countenanced : so that court and church be not at once destroyed , nor the universities be forced to follow Whitehall , which ( They say ) is to be purchased by Jews , and i hope no true Christians will meddle with the other . 

To conclude , if this good old cause puts us not into a bad new case and condition worse than ever , we Might well forget the fifth of November , if the greater deliverance , Might justly obliterate the less . 

Finis .
