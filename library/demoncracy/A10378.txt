The Publisher's Advertisement to the Reader . 

This excellent Piece ( model to that Heroic Work , The History of the World ) being an exquisite Abstract and Summary of all the famous Kingdoms and Empires that ever were ; how worthy it is of public view , will soon appear to a discerning judgement . In this succinct Recollection is contrived ( by a Daedalean Hand ) the Apotelesma and effect of infinite Volumes ; the Original , Progress , and Duration of the most Glorious Monarchies & flourishing States of the World. A Synopsis so mainly conducent and essentially necessary to the right understanding of all Sacred and Secular Histories , as without the conduct thereof ( the like being never yet extant in English ) small benefit can accrue to ordinary Readers . To reduce such a World of Matter , into so compendious Form , can be adjudged no less than an Herculean task . But of This , vulgar Capacities are as incompetent judges , as blind Men of Colours . This Perspective is not fitted to the dull sight of Self-opinionate Ignaroês . To the intelligent and judicious Peruser , if it prove a grateful work ( as to such , undoubtedly it will ) the Publication may be justly reputed Operae pretium . Ave ( there Lector ) & fave huic Opellulae : cui intùs Ambrosia .
