This by friends to the commonwealth is proposed with Mr.  Harrington's consent . 

The reasons for this proposition are these : 

it is the fairest way of proposing a government , that it be first proposed to conviction , before it be imposed by power . 

the persons herein nominated being convinced , it must necessarily have an healing influence upon all the parties , degrees or qualities in this divided nation .
