a vindication of the King with some observations upon the two houses . 

By a true son of the church of England , and a lover of his country's liberty . 

London , printed anno domini , 1642.  

A vindication of the King , &c.  

I shall not be curious to satisfy the reason of any prepossessed opinion , yet since the times hath given an open press to clear every imagination which is not stifled in this damp : i have endeavoured to contract my own meditations in a narrow room ; and rather expose them to the censure of the most judicious , then rest satisfied alone , and admit this cloudy surface to overwhelm so vast a body . 

I confess it was no mean part of my happiness in our dangerous extremes , to hope for a happy union by that sovereign medicine of a fading state , a parliament and knowing the admirable affection of our gracious sovereign to the peace and quiet of the kingdom , though it was his unspeakable misfortune , never to know the misery of the persons , till their discontents were grown to that head , they became almost ( If not altogether uncureable , by those unreasonable monopolies , exacted by some ill affected agents , conducing little to his advantage , but to the furthering of their ambition , who not withstanding , could as easily desert him in his misery , as before be the ready instruments to importune him to this mischief , upon pretence of a legal authority , which who knows not a Prince , May be soon mistaken in , since none can be so silly , as to believe him a studied lawyer : yet that this should expose us to so great an adventure , as not only to divest him of this suspected arbitrary power , but to confer an absolute government to any whatsoever , renders me no other action than the poets , Incidit in syllam cupiens vitare caribdim . 




But if you please to take the true state of the business , let your impartial judgement confer with your reason , upon these few notorious truths . What has the King denied which concern our liberty , and are the undoubted securities of our happiness , under the regiment of a just and unquestionable monarchy ? 

Are not our rights and properties already established this parliament , by such acts of grace , as could never find precedents from his ancestors , besides the utter extirpation of shipmoney , monopolies , upon what pretence soever , those arbitrary courts of justice , high commission , Star-chamber , Marshalseas , &c.  Has he not importuned the settling of religion in his purity , and that there Might be a law , to secure the tender consciences of those who will not agree the ceremonies . Are not the taking away these sufficient ground to desolve our jealousies , if ever we mean to be satisfied . As for their fears , i wish we had as little reason to suspect the fomenters , as we have the King , who is so clearly divested of any power , to make good the least injustice , that it 's too great a hazard on his part to adventure what our consciences enforce us to make good for him on our part : and the conservation of those are so attested by him ( In the word of a King ) with such unusual expressions , that if they came from a stranger , ( I suspected not an infidel ) i was bound to believe in charity , witness those serious asseverations , God so deal with me and my children , as i intend to conserve my parliament in its privileges , the rights of the subject , and the true professed Protestant religion , God so prosper me in what i take in hand . 

Is there yet a further way to establish them , whereby they May be so secure , that a violation May seem impossible , with out the subversion of the very letter of the law : why is it not proposed if it be no invasion of that just prerogative was never denied his ancestors ? and what he hath deserved of us , that he May not be as far trusted , is as hard to object , as easily answered . If then we must needs agree that therebeing nothing so clear , why should any subtle pretences , hinder our desired accommodation , unless there be that intend the alteration of our government , and how inconsistent that May prove to a persons already managed , under the united order of a virtuous King , daily experience offers it too easy of conjecture . Yet for our better satisfaction , let 's weigh the amends we are like to make ourselves , from these few inconveniences , amongst the thousands which daily expose themselves to our view . 

1.  The unlimited power of the two houses have already assumed into their own hands , a formal all ordinance countermanding , suspending , nay , creating acts of parliament , though not in the name of acts , yet in the power of acts , whereby both King and persons are obliged to obey ; how to distinguish this ordinance from an act of state , i am not well satisfied ; yet i have heard it called treason in one of their members , for this comparison , though with that cautious proviso , that it should be no leading case to future ages for judges to imitate . Is this the security of our undoubted rights we have so long endeavoured : who carries not now his life in his hand , managed by an exact power of a bare vote , which if any contradicts , must suffer under the name of a malignant party , though of their own members , and not proceeded against by the justice of any precedent Acts , but condemned by the votes of the present session ; and if this be not an absolute subversion of the rights of parliament , and destructive to the fundamental laws of our kingdom ( Wherein our liberty consists ) i would fain be satisfied what is , for 't is most apparent to , whosoever examines their ordinary proceedings ; we have no law left but what serves their turn ; and if that be defective , to punish those they please to call delinquents , their legislative ordinance can as well supply that defect , as it could make that obnoxious , which till this parliament no man could ever call a fault . 

2.  This continuing power of the two houses , which if they had had a mind should ever be remitted , they would have either expressed it in their first demand , and limited it to a certain time , wherein they Might have completely qualified the disquiet countenance of a troubled estate ; or since have endeavoured some remonstrance for our satisfaction in that particular : for i would fain be answered , first , if they sit while they list , and pass what they list , whether they have not ( During their pleasure ) subverted our monarchy by their democracy and invested themselves of a power more arbitrary , than the monarchical government could pretend to , that having his limitations and rules of law , which the judges are to answer ( If they mistake ) or those that advise the King ; their democracy having no bounds , be but a thing of Yesterday , and which as yet we cannot understand , assuming to themselves the sole power to judge of our dangers , and propose such remedy , as May answer their pretences . 

2.  How every conscientious man can dispense with that sacred oath of allegiance , wherein he calls God to witness for the vindication of his Princes just prerogative ▪ and their protestation to maintain an absolute and unlimited power in the two houses , wrested to those ordinances expressly inhibited by his majesty's special commands ; in my understanding it is to no other purpose , then to lead us into a maze , where when we are lost by our understanding ( Which must necessarily be the principal of our subversion , they will offer us a clue , shall either lead us to their premeditated designs ▪ whereby of necessity they will become our Masters , or to an inevitable ruin , before we know the reason of our fears and jealousies , being the old rule they so often enveighed against , first to trouble a state , then to subvert the government . Let it not be objected now , that i am against parliaments , for ( God knows ) i am for them , and as zealous for my country as any man that lives : but in my opinion , the best way to secure our liberty had been , that our members of both houses Might continue subjects' still , liable to the regiment of those laws which shall  be enacted by them , wherein they will have a care of securing their own estates for future , as well as ours , which was certtinly the intentions of our well advised ancestors , in exposing so great a trust into their hands , when the Prince called for their advice in matters of greatest concernment ; but by this continue session , they not only are invested of an absolute power , but are able to make themselves amends at leisure for those monies exhausted out of their estates , while we groan under the insupportable burden of theirs ( As they call them ) legal taxes : and •nss they May well be careless what laws are past , never intending to be observers , but Lords of what they make . 

3.  Who are these pretended reformers of the commonwealth , but the very instruments who were the favourites during our oppression ; i need not name them to any , who has once attended the epidemicke trouble of our age , and what unheard of conversion we can make of their lives , whereby such a confidence should be reposed in them , as to divest so religious and just a Prince of his unquestionable rights and prerogatives , and confer such an unlimited power so readily upon them , if we return our former senses , renders me amazed ; 't is not amiss to ruminate some words his majesty used in his own vindication at New-market , my Lords , lay your hands on your hearts , who were the contrivers of these illegal taxes , wherewith you have so incensed my persons : to whose advantage were these impositions levied ? are my exchequers at all larger ? or did you not rather conduce to your peculiar benefit , who were the only persuaders of them , that you have now repaid me with condign thanks . Those favourites being content to be the causers , though not the companions of their Prince's misfortunes : being like crows upon a carcase , that have no sooner bared the bones , but they are flown . Are we not yet sensible the rules of policy , not of honesty , to secure their lives and fortunes , not their consciences , exposed you to this politic , not public service ; and had you not in so exact a course served your turns of these loyal pretenders ; they had been as liable to the extremity of justice , as the greatest delinquents that underwent the most heavy censures ; and undoubtedly had had their deserved shares , which would have given a better colour to their upright proceedings as they would have you •o believed . If they had impartially distributed justice amongst the then malignant party : but now that we should be so stupid as to b• circumvented with any pretences whatsoever , which outstrip the essential rules of government or reason , and confide in the positive vo  ambitious party ( For aught we know ) would admit my perswa•••• be a madman that could allow that in his opinion , •ut make th'  you will , suppose them to be the most real and upright  lives and consciences in the whole world : they are but the counsel of the King and kingdom , not their commanders , for the •ealth of our state is admirably balanced if that have but his due proportion ; the parliament consisting of three bodies , the King , the Lords , and Commons , so that if two should be destructive , and the third remain sound during those laws already in force , there can be no danger to our kingdom , but if either of the two can pass at their pleasure what they will , the third must then of necessity stand for a cypher , for consenting or disagreeing is then of equal value , and in my opinion it is a precedent of too great an adventure , for suppose the King and the major part of the Lords should agree an ordinance or law , we should think extremely prejudicial to the liberty of the subject , our Commons should be concluded peremptorily against their consents : i heard an act not long since vouched in precedent that had been ratified against their consent of the Lords spiritual , where they declared nec possumus nec volumus consentire , and this so rare we could not find a second . At the parliament at Oxford in 17 h. 3. when the Lords were not there present , they were fain to dissolve the house without passing one act , confirming my first proposition . That the consent of two bodies are not of force to make us laws without the third , much less conclude ; the King who is not only the supreme head , but the very soul , whose power gives life to their actions , when their body is once dissolved , besides how in incoherent is it , with that authority committed to them , for if the parliament ( Which are only his great council ) offer him a bill , which he is bound to agree , it was more than ever his ancestors were ; and of their counsellors , it must necessarily follow , they are his commanders . 

We have a maxim with the subject , modus & conventio vincunt legem . in former ages and ever since parliaments were in use , le roy s'aviser a were sufficient authority to make a bill of both houses unwarrantable ; and how the King has lost that right , or what new laws are found out destructive to that prerogative , i never yet read , nor ever shall , unless some such new ordinance or bare votes can pretend to such an un warranted power ( Whereof there was never yet found a precedent ) which can have no other operation upon my understanding , then , that the votes of the present members which can at their pleasures dispose the undoubted privileges of the crown ( By a law recorded only in their own breasts ) and given out to us under the guilded title of the people's liberty , when indeed they are but golden chains in stead of bulrushes , and ( Reserved till occasion shall make it too apparent ) May find out a law of equal force to dispose the crown , when they shall so far debilitate the Prince as he shall be no way able to make resistance ; nor when the supporters are not only undermined but clearly taken away ; by what reason can we imagine the structure May continue  , that you May be sure we will not unjustly charge them be pleased to observe with me their orders in these few instances . 

1.  Their countenancing these unwarranted acts , either by a seditious huddle of indigent persons , and so procuring petitions to necessitate these premeditated proceedings , or levying an absolute war against the King ; securing us upon no other reasons then that they are the representative body of the kingdom , and therefore our obedience , rather to be expected , than our reason satisfied , which indeed is true enough if they proceeded upon that warranted rule to which no man could refuse observance , or being entrusted by us with the power of preceding parliaments ; that they would pursue points of so high concernment , with the same mature reasons and deliberation , as they have done and then they Might well expect our readiness to secure their actions : but suppose we elect one that should speak or endeavour to exact treason , does our election bid as to secure him , or will future parliaments blame us hereafter for giving up so great a delinquent to the justice of the laws ? dare we countenance their intentions , who have fetched precedents from the weakest Princes , ( Nay , and go beyond them too ) is the disadvantage of as able a Prince as ever yet held the sceptre , nay , and offer their suppositions to the vulgar , if the Prince be a fool , a child , &c. ought he not to be governed by his council , though it be against his consent , if it stand with the public benefit ? what implication to make of this i understand not , but i am sure that it was none of our meaning when we gave our voice in the election : can an ordinance of parliament without the consent of the King renew a repeated act , and with so bold a countenance trample upon the heels of that parliament in Richard the seconds time , and this very repealed act renewed this parliament , be within one step of it , wherein the parliament took the crown and gave it to the then Earl of Bullingbrook , which was the reason of so much blood in our civil wars , and was not well settled till of late years ? And can we blame the King if he desires shelter from such a storm ? If it be their intentions , sure one Bullingbrook will not serve their turns , since there have been equal shares in this so great an adventure . And to vouch the oath of this usurper h. 4. which came in at their benevolence to a Prince of an unquestionable title , and never offered before or since to any English King that ever we read or heard of ( But with its limitations ) is so far from their loyal pretences , that they are rather to be believed studied mischiefs and endeavours , to embroil the kingdom in a civil war . 

2.  To disengage all that would out of affection or love , interest themselves to secure the King's person , and dignity , ( It being too apparent to any ordinary understanding ) that such proceedings were never warranted by any precedents of preceding parliaments , or those laws they call fundamental in our kingdom , they scandalize such with the name of malignant persons , whereby his menial servants either absolutely refused , or durst not adventure his attendance , and countenance this medley in such a sense , that the King himself is perpetually traduced under this obstruse dialect ; which though they dare not put down in plain English , for fear the most violent amongst them should be ashamed to own it ; yet by such an implication , as the plainest capacity cannot but blush , and with admiration wonder , whereto this May tend , i would fain be satisfied , what these Might not do , when they had once Mastered these their malignant's : for if you will give us as much reason as the ants , you must believe a winter May come , as well as think a summer is come : durst any man than oppose their proceedings , when they have reduced all to their own terms , do you not speak yourselves the very law , and we as we ought to yield no appeal from parliament , being the highest court in the kingdom ; yet in this sense as the King is a part of it ( For otherwise i understand not by what right ) it hath the pre-eminence of those they call the King's courts , being both convened by the same royal authority . 

3.  The discountenancing any petitions whatsoever ( Wherein we desire to interpose our advice for accommodation or otherwise ) though never so agreeing with our laws , unless they stand with the sense of their party , as if all our wisdom were shut up in so narrow limits , and these the only men in England iafallible : yet give me leave to aver , that to the number of almost two hundred approved able men , whose warranted judgement and sufficiencies were the only inducement of their country's election , have been fain to sit still , and see things carried in this disorderly confusion , ( Peremptorily against their earnest endeavours ) and have not been so much as asked their opinions in matters of greatest concernment ; but being unwilling to expose their consciences to so high a gild , have with drawn themselves as unuseful members of such a body . 

4.  To insinuate a belief of their care to the vulgar , they have perpetually surmised terrible jealousies , which have produced no other effect , than a desired suspicion of the King , yet these offered upon most improbable conjecturs , as every private letter is sufficient grounds to piece up their designs , or by such persons whose private discontents , lead them to offer these high indignities to that sacred person , they were never worthy to serve in the meanest office ; and though there lives were so notorious for their forms extravagancies , they have by these superfluous invectives found countenance , till presuming upon their merits , which were none except to abuse the King , can be called desert ; that they have been given up to rapine , or some such damnable sin , that nature would never have pardoned , if we had had no law ; yet these men's informations , sufficient grounds to traduce the King , these letters most necessary animadversions to leafy forces , to maintain the King's forts , towns , and magazines against him , i , and in his own name to , as if they could derive that authority from him , that has no power ( According to your ordinance ) to leafy them in his own defence , though his person is in never so apparent imminent danger ; yet they for his good , and the good of the kingdom , can pretend to this power , and beyond , yet that all is not of that infallibility , let Mr.  Pim's letter from Sir John Hotham witness with me . 

I have committed these few observations , to the view of the public , finding so many bold pamphlets ( With so high impudence ) fly at the face of majesty unreproved , and every corner stinks of this unclean doctrine : yet since it is come to this height , that we must declare ourselves , or lose our King , : wherein my purpose fails , my life shall make good to my last breath ; but if religion , reason , and law had not warranted so just a cause , i should never have adventured to clear a glass to so foul a countenance : yet before i conclude , let me propose one question in religion : whether the church was not in its purity in the primitive times ; the world agrees they had in those days a King that was no Christian ? Whether Christ had not more power ( Than ever any can or dare pretend to since ) to eclipse that regal dignity , if it had been destructive to the church ? yet he refused the lowest office of a magistrate , but gave to Caesar the things that were his , for when the young man came to him and said , Lord command my brother that he divide the inheritance with me , he replies , who made me a ruler or a judge amongst you ? but now , that we having a Christian King , professing by his unblemished life , the same way to salvation with us , protesting to conserve our liberties with his life , to make such an apparent difference , which May be the occasion of the effusion of so much Christion blood , upon mere jealousies , will be the most unheard of disloyalty that can be committed to future ages .
