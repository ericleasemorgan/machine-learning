To the right honourable the great council in parliament now assembled , and the council of state . 

Right trusty , and right honourable senators . 

I and not i only , but many far more considerable , have been spectators of those intricate mazes , and indefatigable troubles , which you as our worthies , have for above these six years past undergone , not to be paralelled to any time , save that of Israel's deliverance from Pharaoh out of the house of bondage , which you as so many noble instruments , by the strength of the arm of the mighty God of Jacob , have performed to the present accomplishment for us , ( As great a deliverance . ) For the which blessed be the God most high , as also for that after so great winnowing , there yet remains so considerable a number of you found faithful to your trust , and though this May be esteemed by you honourable worthies , a boldness in the presenter ( Near unto presumption ) to mention your honour's names in this epistle , for which i have nothing to plead for in excuse , but this , namely , that your honours are nearly and greatly concerned in the subject matter of this ensuing discourse , which if he , that is the head of all principalities and powers , the mighty counsellor , by whom Princes decree just things , shall strengthen and guide you to follow : i , and not i only , but all conscientious men , and true Christians , shall therein have their desires , and you their prayers : 

So resteth Your most humble and devoted servant , not worthy to be named , as considerable : d. p.  

To the reader . 

i had a great dispute in my spirit in this very nick of time , whether ▪ i should speak or keep silence , & that not only because in these evil day's vanity and troth , not truth , is either through prejudice or wilfulness approved and extolled amongst men ; but also through a sense of my stammering imb•cility , at being unlearned in human sciences , i was afraid to show in public this my opinion : for i said in my thoughts , that days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom ; but since i understood that it is the inspiration of the almighty that gives understanding ; i durst not smother that little light under a bushel , which he hath as a talon given me to improve for his glory and the common good : upon this ground than i have adventured to cast my mite into the public treasury , presenting these ensuing lines to thy serious perusal ; the principal theme and substance of which is to show how this our tottering fabric both in church and state , May again be resettled upon the sure basis of a true primitive institution : and here if in this transaction i have not so managed it , as a business of so great importance doth require ; i hope my former acknowledged weakness will plead for me a favourable excuse , if not acceptance : and lest a string of reproof by any over-winded expressions in this my book May sound harshly in the ears of some , so as to hinder the melodious harmony of an intended union by me held forth ; i shall endeavour again to loose it by an ingenuous acknowledgement . 

For i profess as in the presence of God , i am no enemy to any man's person , being sorry to see , much more to use either the name of a leveller , or presbyter , ( Having in both very loving friends ) if i could by any other names distinguish them to a vulgar understanding , which yet are justly to be blamed and withstood , because they go not the right way to a civil or ecclesiastical pe•ce . There is only one word that hath escaped me , that probably May give occasion to some to take off•nce ; and that is in the 15.  Page , towards the end , where quoting the prophet Hosea , it is said , that God hath justly given up these men , that is to say , some of our conceived wise diviners , and pretended prophets to folly , and a dog raging madness rather than a rational or Christian spirit . And here i could wish i Might not say so of some which bite and snarl at their brethren , not showing yet any true reason wherefore : but God forbid i should say so of all ; and truly because of offence , if it could have been timely prevented , i would have said so of none : yet is this a term the holy spirit hath used in way of reproof of some of the same function , though in another case , when he calleth them both dumb and greedy dogs ▪ and again for fear of mistake , because i have desired there Might be no imparity of persons in the ministry in reference to human learning , that therefore i should be thought an enemy to learning ; no certainly , i could wish the universities Might be kept up and maintained in their former luster , that so as God shall bring forth by the hand of providence , we May by such a common and commendable gift still find instruments that in some cases Might be more useful than others either in church or state . 

And lastly , though i have highly commended the excellency of this outward form , which indeed ought to be observed ; yet i hope none is so ignorant as to think that the true glory and beauty of Christ's church is not more principally within ; but since both are concerned in reference to the outward and inward man ; therefore it was that Israel's deliverance out of Egypt was a deliverance in an outward way of worship for both ; upon which ground it is not to be doubted that through the great power of our redeemer , we shall at this time not only have a deliverance in the inward , but also a freedom of the outward man , else should we have nothing wherewith voluntarily to tender as a worship to God : for these reasons , as also for some occasional faults in the printing , i have contrary to my intended purpose presented thee with this epistle , wishing a favourable construction of the whole at least , or of my good intention herein : and so i shall ever rest , 

Thine to command in the Lord . d. p.

The true state and form of government , civil & ecclesiastical discussed & cleared . 

Not long since there was in public , a little book entitled , a shrill cry , for the resolve of 13 queries , in which , with many other things touching the covenant &c. very considerable , there was inserted , the primitive institution and supreme end , of a civil and ecclesiastical government , in a more full pursuance then of what was there so briefly presented , i shall endeavour in this ensuing discourse , to hold forth these 3 particulars , as very necessary further to be discussed and cleared in these times . First wherein each particular government , with their distinct and peculiar interest doth a part consist . 2.  In what particulars they May harmoniously accord . 3.  Some probable means propounded tending to settle each in their primitive glory . 

To begin then with that government which is called civil . First acted upon the theatre of this world , yet in force , which as touching the form since , hath been very contingent & uncertain . God sometimes deputing one as supreme to give out laws , and rule the nations . Sometimes permitting others by right of conquest to impose laws , upon the subdued multitude , some were elected Kings , to whose laws the persons voluntarily submitted . Others by their representatives proposing laws to these elected Kings , by which they would be governed . And lastly some few have been elected in several counties to govern and transact for the good and benefit of the whole . These and such like , are usually distinguished by the names of monarchy , aristocracy , democracy , &c.  The reason of which variety , hath been the universal corruption of human flesh . Governors being drawn aside by their own concupiscence , through ambition , and self-interest , and other causes , to pursue ends destructive to common-safety . But from the beginning it was not so , for if man had stood , the most pure and primitive had been that of monarchy . Adam being entrusted under Christ to wield the supreme sceptre of this terrestrial diadem , which probably Might have continue to all succeeding generations . The subject matter for which government , would have been his own offspring and fellow creatures . The form most excellent , each minister under him in their proper place , orderly and sweetly dispencing an equal distribution , to God , and each particular being . The rules and bounds for which , was the law of nature , reason , & morality . 

The discipline was by instruction , exhortation , example , and such like , to draw forth and exercise daily the intellect of all intelligible creatures in the things before recited . So as from nonage , to full-age , each particular according to their measure and proper place , Might become serviceable to the universal and public good . There being yet this difference in the state of innocency ( Though continue ) between Adam and his progeny , that as he was create a perfect man , his internal faculties was acted readily from himself as several objects and relations were presented in their time and place , whereas his posterity stood in need of a continual inculcation of instruction from others , before they could act their inward principle , dexteriously , and habitually in a way of nature and reason , to which , other parts of discipline before expressed in this state of corruption , is necessarily to be added , sharp reproofs and severe corrections . The next and last particular appertaining to this government , is the supreme end : namely the preservation of each man's propriety in name , goods , and other things of this life . And herein the particular and entire interest of this and all other civil sanctions doth consist . A first testament and covenant once in the power of man to keep most perfectly , which since through weakness of the flesh , fruits and effects of the fall , is now impossible , precisely to be performed : all men in nature thereupon by a just sentence , as under the first breach of this law , becoming children of the curse , wrath , and death : we need not wonder then at the revolutions and changes of government , since every thing else now is restless , until it return to its primitive and supreme centre , from whence there was suddenly so great an apostasy , that the whole earth was filled with violence , insomuch , immediately after , man's commecall scheane of terestiall glory , became dissolved into a watery tragedy , a few inconsiderate persons for number , only excepted , preserved from being overwhelmed in that universal deluge , which no sooner by multiplying had again filled the surplase of the earth , but the like universal corruption appeared : all fixed principles for pure nature , reason , and morality , was by it eaten out , and became obliterate ; which doubtless was the cause why God in the next age did again mind the same through the figure of circumcision , as also , not long after in that terrible manner upon mount Synaia in Judea , the hemisphere of nations , give out his law , to show man once more , not only from whence he was fallen , but to stir him up thereby to his former duty , the matter whereof was engraven in tables of stone , evidently to be seen and read of all men . 

And although here again , the form of this government than was monarchical ; yet was it not therein an indisputable precedent and pattern for other nations or succeeding times , for though it should be admitted that this was most primitive , and in gods esteem most excellent , either in Adam , and those other anointed Kings , to whom extraordinary assistance and abilities was given for performance of such a trust , as particular types of Christ : yet experience tells us through changes ; and reason and providence dictates no less ; that where this immediate divine assistance is wanting , to guide any single supreme in evil times of defection , that government proves dangerous , and those governors probably most safest for that persons , which shall through providence be admitted to rule , after a sensible feeling , and late deliverance with them from under a yoke of tyranny : it not to me seeming likely , that such who have seen justice done upon others , themselves in it being instrumental , should through tyranny by any law , make heavy yokes for their brethren , and in it their own posterity ( Which if ) they would be most inexcusable , because they of all other , in this latter age of the world have seen most examples and precedents of the good , and evil of government : thus much then of the first particular , in which is briefly showed the ministers , matter , form , laws , discipline , end , and entire interest of all civil government , both at first and since , which because it was held excellently forth in the commonwealth of the Jews : it was called a sanctuary a yet worldly and fleshly , far different from that , which concerns the inward and spiritual man , which though the ministration of it be in the flesh ; yet it is not after , nor for the present , little appertaining thereunto : it being until the day of our bodily redemption , b under the discipline of the first testament ; for corrupt flesh , as all now is , must as grass and the flower of the field , first wither , become dead , & vanish away in the judgement of those , which are to be fit matter for the second and new testament , for the body c must be dead because of sin , when the spirit is to live for a better righteousness sake . 

And so i come to the second particular , the government ecclesiastical , which imediately receded the other in the infancy thereof . The instruments and forms whereof , hath also been various before the time of Christ's fleshly presence ; the reason of which was , the good pleasure of the fathers will , the divine mystery of his grace , since revealed to us in the fullness of time , for the most part hide in d him , whose dispensations & works always appear most perfect in the end . During the infancy and minority , of the mystical body of Christ the church then begun ; it seemed good to him here and there to enlighten , and by a secret and inward call , to separate and segregate from the common mass of mankind , such as should hold forth according to the measure of faith then dispensed , the word of life : that in divers ways , manners , e and forms of discipline , were made instrumental in their generations , to congregate as time and place afforded , the children of truth . Gradually first preparing , and then through union of affection couching them in their due place , as so many polished stones , upon that precious corner , and first foundation stone of the spiritual temple Christ Jesus : i purpose not here for brevity sake , to write severally of the particular forms in those ages past ; but rather with the * author of that forenamed pamphlet , i shall fall in with his method in that form since , as a government for us more practically imitable : it was evident then according to scripture , when the full time apppointed of the father , for the spiritual liberty and age of the church was come : he sent forth his son into the world , clothing him with human flesh , and in the substance and shape of man put him under the law : 

That in his pure flesh , in man's stead , and for his benefit , he Might actively and passively perform , what God or man , by any law could possibly require ; and though he knew no sin , neither was a transgressor of any law ; yet he being instrumental in the creation of man , the first , and supreme * head of man , by relation a * brother to man , and by a peculiar right had an interest in man ; it was both just and reasonable , that he only as the fittest person should principally transact the affairs of man , and for that end , he was by God in the behalf of all fallen man , imputed a sinner , numbered amongst transgressors , made a curse by suffering upon the cross , as a thief and murderer , that so through this , God's peculiar ordinance and acceptance , he Might no more remember or punish eternally the transgressions committed against the first testament ; as also to give a sure ground of future hope , that the bodies of the faithful one day , shall be perfectly redeemed from the power of sin , death , and the devil , unto which by a righteous sentence , they became with others most miserably captivated , with all to give good assurance to all such , by the death and sealing bloodshed of this son of God , which was apppointed to be both the testator and mediator of the new covenant t eternally established upon sure promises , their spirits once cleansed from the filth and guilt of the old : May now by a new and living way through the veil of his flesh , have a free passage into the most holy sanctuary and presence of our heavenly father , in the glorious liberty of the sons of God ; and for that end this our great high priest and apostle of that faith , which we should profess during the time of his abode upon earth , he made it his own ; because the father's work , to dispense light according to his will in matters of this nature , that so by it , he Might publicly gather unto himself all those children of God that were capable subjects for an audible administration ; and for that cause he was pleased to elect , not only twelve principal , but many others , to whom he did impart those mysteries , that they Might afterwards as good disciple and scribes before instructed , communicate the same . Upon whom after his ascension he poured out his spirit , in the dispensation of extraordinary gifts ; that so by them the foundation begun , and form prescribed for such a spiritual structure Might successively be carried on in all succeeding times , until the very top stone should be laid , and grace , grace , cried thereunto : it 's easily conceived then by that 's past , who were the Mr. workmen , and what was the matter for this building ; but for evincing a double mistake in our pretended Mr.  Builders : it 's necessary the matter of it be a little further considered : it being affirmed by some on the one hand , that all persons in a nation ; yea infants are fit materials for this celestial fabric : the folly of which opinion appeareth , in that it is not only contrary to the practice and direct precept ; but also the true nature and end of this institution by Christ : besides , what benefit can accrue to infants , and others almost as uncapable to be made members by any initiating ordinance , since they are in no capacity ( Through natural weakness ) visibly to do or receive any good , neither hath God at any time , or anywhere ( As is falsely by them premised , engaged through an unwarrantable use of baptism , to wash away original sin , regenerate , visibly unite to himself , and save infants ; for why then doth not answerable effects follow : time quickly showing that many thousands so baptised , become abominable and reprobate to every good work : strange therefore it is to see how these men have been puzzled to evade the clear light of this scripture ; go discipline and baptise , and that other scripture , he that believeth and is baptised shall be saved ; but to these persons it seemeth fulfilled , if they enjoin others to profess faith for them , which visibly have none ; as if one man's bare profession , which is not probably real , were with God meritoriously saving for others , in like manner are they puzzled about circumcision , which they say baptism cometh in the room of , when its clear to them which will understand , that circumcision was no initiating ordinance for a church , and gospel fellowship ? It being but a sign of an external covenant and stipulation made with Abraham and his seed , for a revive of the first testament , touching a civil and unblameable conversation in the flesh : for saith God , my covenant shall be in your g flesh : so that all Israel after the flesh , by the law gendering to bondage , were not Israel after the spirit , born of the free woman , gendering to a spiritual liberty : and this i am induced verily to believe , for these reasons , viz.  

First , because all those that partook of circumcision , by scripture proof were rigedly bound to a personal and perpetual performance of the moral law , in reference to the outward man h which our saviour yet testifieth , none of them did * keep , nor indeed could , as they Might the ceremonial and other laws . 

Secondly , from the nature of the law itself , which in scripture , is compared to fire , hammer , sword , &c. whereof circumcision was a figurative sign , showing it to be no less than a keen cutting instrument , through the penalty , which by a secret insition was to separate that caule , skin or film spread over the spirit , eye , & judgement of reason , at first occasionally entering in by the senses , & now through custom being so habitually contracted in man's nature , as it proves to some many times an incurable disease . i necessary it was then , that from the eight day of the womb , at the first budding of the senses they should be gradually and regularly disciplined accordingly . And as for time , so for place , this sign was very significant , it being done there , from whence instrumentally was to be acted , the strongest and most burning lust of human and natural concupiscence , the difficulty in suppressing which , and the danger of neglecting , was secretly hinted by the pain , sorrow and bloodshed in this ceremonial transaction , neither is the persons less observable , God showing by such an administration , that it was the male , not the female that was first entrusted , from whom as the head and stronger vessel , he chiefly of him required performance , or else his blood must go , or some others for him must do and suffer , what in God's account is a satisfaction equivolent . 

Thirdly , when circumcision and the law , was most in force , and highly exalted , and through a sense thereby of man's weakness , though it became instrumental to beget as upon Hagar's knees faithful children unto Abraham : yet gospel and evangelical righteousness , as a spring and river of life , sweetly , yet secretly was then running under allegories , tips and ceremonies , in a ministration distinctly differing from the former , for they all drank of the same spiritual rock that followed them , and that rock was Christ , and they all were baptised as well as circumcised , though mystically under a cloud and in the sea , where water and not blood , was the material substance of this ordanicall sacrament . 

Fourthly , from the nature and end of baptism itself , which is not to be paralleled so , as to come in the room of circumcision . The matter and manner of which holy institution , presenteth to our view and serious consideration , these several things following . First , that it is neither circumcision , nor any other ceremonial reparation , but an absolute sacramental dissolution of our bodily elements , into their first principles , as best suiting with a visible gospel administration , from which secondly , was lively represented to the eye of faith , not sense , by the death of the body , a spiritual freedom from the imputation of sin , * power of the law , curse , death and the devil . The ground of which , is this , in that god at first gave this law principally to be binding to the sensitive and weaker part , the inward man from it being destinct , although united , makes but one person l upon which the outward , being first in the transgression , and by occasion an inlet of sin to the other . It pleased God , to impute that sin , and charge the punishment upon it , when yet by a decreed union . If faith in an unexpected promise had not intervened , the inward had also been in the same predicament , from the nearness of which union of these two destinct natures , there is a communion of operations and proprieties , so that what May be affirmed of one and the same person , at one and the same time , in reference to one nature , May be denied of the other , so that by one he May be said to be earthly , dead under the law , &c. and by the other , he May be said to be yet heavenly , not living under that law , holy , blessed , and under the protection of God for ever . And yet again , where faith in a promise is not , there a person in both natures is perpetually miserable , but where it is , that person in both natures , is eternally happy . 

Yet in order , first the one and then the other , this then asserted is cleared , if we observe that when God came to execute judgement , he progressively past sentence upon that which was the first occasion of sin , beginning with the serpent , than the woman , and last of all , with the earthly man , making good his former threatening , that in the day it did eat , it should die , for earth it was , and to earth it should return , which was the substance of the outward , not the inward M man . Thus than this exact compounded elementary substance , at first a fit instrument for the celestial spirit , to transact a terrestrial service , being under the sentence of death , it became not only unserviceable through a declining weakness , but it caused also a spiritual death , dulling the edge and quenching the sparklings in the intellect of the divine offspring , for the cheering and reviving again of which , he was pleased by a promise in a blessed seed of the same substance , to give hope to the one , by dying , of a better resurrection , and through the quickening spirit , for the present to give the other deliverance from a sinful captivity . Now a figure of this death of the body was lively held forth by the bodies & blood of beasts , which were to be offered up in sacrifice , as a present atonement for the reprieve of all sublimary create things of the same elementary substance , until the substance of that which was chiefly tipified and intended , namely the body of Christ ; in which as a spiritual public person , all the bodies of the saints was included , in the offering up of which , the will of God being done , he hath consecrate for ever ( Through that will ) those which by faith in his blood were sanctified . Thirdly , baptism was also ordained , that it Might be not only a similitude of that union and communion of the body of Christ with the faithful , but also that it Might hold forth by this union to a visible part in the behalf of the rest of the members of the invisible body , a community of the same spirit , virtue , life , resurrection and glory , of the head . 

And this we find excellently set forth to us ; worthy our serious perusal , in the sixt and seventh chapters to the Romans , the apostle in the seventh showing , that now the first husband the body , to whom the spirit by union was married , it was dead to the law in the body of Christ ; so that now the spirit without being Counted an adulteress , Might make choice for a husband him that is raised from the dead : that by such a union it Might bring forth fruit unto God , for faith he , when we were in the flesh , the affections of sin which were by the law , had force in our members to bring forth fruit unto death , but now we are delivered from the law , he being dead , that is to say , the body , in whom we were holden , that we should serve him in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter . Fourthly and lastly , by the water in baptism , covering the earth of man's body , it being plunged therein , was further signified , the sanctifying and renewing again of the body through that spirit , which by a first moving on the surface of the waters , gave being in the creation to all things of the same elementary substance , which should be as certainly performed , as man's body came forth of the waters ; a sure testimony of which was evident in the head , and others the first fruits of the same : by this then as i conceive , hath been confuted the first error , showing that infants and many others , upon these grounds , are not fit matter for a visible church or congregation , and though i have in this exceeded an intended brevity , yet in things so greatly important ; it will i trust be excusable , for this seriously considered will put an end to those bitter long disputes , and voluminous treatises about the law , and gospel . God's seeing , or not seeing sin , in reference to the one , or the other covenant , &c.  The error on the other hand is , in some that conceive them only fit , which for knowledge and practice are seemingly more eminent , whereas at first a gospel conviction , and need of a Christ , and a voluntary submission to his government , for a further instruction through doctrine and discipline was a good ground of admission . For Christ's kingdom in the church , is a kingdom of grace , long-sufferance , and meekness . The subjects whereof at first are very rough hewed , not polished stones , weak in knowledge , and many times more in practice . Those ministers and strong Christians then entrusted , aught to bear the infirmities of the more feeble , carrying these lambs in the bosom of love , leading gently , and guiding these younglings in grace , like good pastors , so truly knowing the state of their flock , as to distinguish them by their names , natures , and manners , that so he Might accordingly feed them with knowledge and understanding ; not in civil contentions , but evangelical conclusions , but how rare are such at this present , & what plenty of those shepherds that God so * passionately and pathetically reproves in Ezekiel's time , that he said , eat the fat , and clothed themselves with the fleece of the sheep , but did not care to feed ▪ so as to strengthen the weak , heal the sick , bind up the broken , bring again that which is driven away , neither sought that which was lost , but with cruelty and rigour did they rule them . The Lord himself then the great and living shepherd , there promiseth to supply their place , and do that for his sheep which was neglected by those evil shepherds , that is to say , to lead them into green gospel pastures , refreshing them with the sweet and pleasant springs of salvation , strengthening the weak , healing the sick , &c.  As it followeth excellently in the same chapter . 

The next thing then to the matter , is the form of this government , which was first , those ministerial officers , as to be ordinary and perpetual , were pastors , to instruct and teach . Deacons , to collect , keep , and disburse the public stock . Elders , among themselves to overrule and end all civil and occasional differences ; seers , to watch over each particular member , which was to present , as need required , the true state of things to the church ; there was also a form of sacraments , one of baptism , of which is already spoken . One other and main end of which was to distinguish all visible members within , from them without , putting such into a visible capacity thereby of those benefits before expressed , to which then was added the sacrament of the Lord's supper , through which , those before baptised were made to drink into that one spirit , which spiritually quickened it by faith in the blood of Christ , running through the veins of the whole body , typically represented by way of communion in the element of wine , to the very senses of the faithful , all those benefits of Christ's death and resurrection , which upon frequent meeting they were publicly to hold forth in remembrance of the same . 

After these , next in order was the form of doctrine , that is to say , first , to acknowledge God even that father of whom originally and effentially were all things either temporal or spiritual , according to whose supreme will , all the distinct families in heaven and earth was both ordered and named ; as also that Jesus Christ his first begotten son , was that person by whom all things was made , is now preserved , redeemed , and shall again , what belongs to him , be restored ; for which cause he descended , suffered , ascended according to the scripture , sitting now at the right hand of God , until all enemies are made his footstool , which once performed , he shall then deliver up the kingdom to God the father , which then shall be all in all to the whole body , filling every part according to their measure with his own fulness ; as he now doth the head , for the effecting of all which glorious promises , in the behalf of the holy visible , invisible , militant , and at last triumphant church . That there is one infinite , invisible , incomprehensible , most omnipotent spirit , which is that of the fathers , communicated to the son and from him , as head , to the whole body . The fift was the form of discipline , which was this , every officer in their proper place , through meekness and love , by exhortation , instruction , reproof , and if need require , with consent of the church , through excommunication , to use their utmost endeavour to present such , who have voluntarily submitted unto their government , blameless in the day of Christ ; and then the last of all is the supreme end , namely , the preservation of each saints propriety in their spiritual names , privileges and benefits of an eternal life , so as each member in their proper place , May according to the effectual working and power , which is in the measure of every part , receive the increase of the body unto the edifying itself in love , until we all meet together in the unity of faith , and that acknowledging of the son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ . Thus as briefly as i could , hath been showed also the governors , government , matter , form , of doctrine and discipline , with the distinct and supreme end , of this ecclesiastical government of Christ . 

The third thing promised to be considered was this , in what respect these two governments , so diametrically opposite , as heaven and earth , May yet agree and dwell together in a nation , city , family or person . First , they May agree in this , that the son of God is constituted , and by public inauguration , is crowned and anointed King and head of both these principalities and powers , with their several instruments , and weapons , whither carnal or spiritual . Secondly they May accord in this , that the spiritual deserves the right hand of fellowship , since all sublimary things had a being with the external , for ends subservient to this , which when it shall perfectly be accomplished in the nations . This exterior government shall be dissolved and cease . The Kings and rulers of the gentiles rejoicing to bring their glory to it ; casting their crowns at the feet thereof , as a due homage to this eternal excellency . * thirdly , they May sweetly echo in this , to pray for , rejoye in , and wishing well , to the prosperity and peace of each other . And fourthly , they May be unanimous in this , namely to assist and preserve each other , in their distinct sphere and equipage , so that God as supreme May have his due , and man as subordinate his . Fiftly and lastly , that they May and aught to assent in this , that each person in respect of his outward man , is under the command , approbation , and punishment of a civil state , as it shall act publicly for the good , or to the apparent prejudice of the same , when at the same time the inward , in matters of faith , as they concern another life , is under the command , approbation , or punishment of the church , whereof he is a member , as it shall publicly act for the good or the apparent prejudice thereof . Thus having past the second , i come to the third . 

Well then , as for the lawful authority of those governors , that through the over ruling hand of the most high , we are at this present under , i dispute not . Of which , those that are doubtful and desire to be informed , May do well to read that forementioned * sheet or two , which perfectly speaks my judgement therein . This premised , i proceed to the third and last general head of this discourse , namely first to present by way of proposal to our honourable worthies , some probable means whereby their government May be comfortable to themselves , and prosperous to the persons . And here with the beloved disciple John , i shall mind them of that which was from the beginning , according to that which hath already been in part , showed , that is to say , first , that they would aim at the same end , in all transactions , which God did in the primitive institution of a civil government , which briefly was this , that they would be ten commandment magistrates , giving God and man his due , after the two tables , according to nature and reason . 

Secondly , for pursuing of which , because not ubiquitarie , Jethro's counsel Might be taken , to choose out in the nation men fearing God , hating covetousness , which in their places May judge and determine lesser matters . 

Thirdly that accordingly as at first , there May be a government , not only magisticall , but sympathetic , and impartial . That so it be not endangered to split upon the rock either of a just calumny , or a pusillanimious contempt . 

Fourthly , that for the protection and praise of them that do well , they would take notice of evil doers , disturbers of public peace , to make them exemplary for the same , which principally now are the * irreverent impatient restless levellers * , or pretended reverend ministerial * presbyters . the first of which , upon what male contented ground , or tumour i know not , endeavour machevile and Jesuit like , to divide and distract , and as much as in them lies to confound the counsels of our experienced grave and honourable sennators , out of a pretended jealousy before trial made , after all their winnowing , May probably betray their trust , which to me , certainly neither the law of nature , God or nations , ever gave private persons such a power , to anticipate and prejudge , the transactions in dubious matters of their supreme governor , which doubtless must needs have more knowledge ( Through experience ) in the affairs of state than the most extraordinary private spirit amongst the giddy multitude . And as for those other , which pretend to be sacred , calling themselves ambassadors of Christ , which if they were indeed : they would never speak reproachfully evil of the rulers of the persons , as they do in pulpits , and did in their late letter to the general and officers of the army , a paper , in itself most self and scandalous , since those that they asperse are public persons ; and themselves ( Though presumed public ) are in civil things private , which if no more were said , it was a sufficient answer to their letter . Again , if it should be admitted , that the supreme governors , and those under them entrusted * now in being , were an usurped power , and not agreeing with the law of the land , as they falsely insert , yet God's bare permission of such a power , were ground enough not only of submission , but their prayers also . If the precept of the apostle Paul be by them thought imitably practical . 

But these men presume ( Doubtless of a more extraordinary spirit ) like the prophets of old , taking upon them to reprove magistrates , which they by visions , many times confirmed by miracles , they had an immediate mission . Those being the gods , to whom peculiarly the word of God then was sent . Which if they can prove such a calling , they shall be no more private but public persons , to whom not only magistrates , but all others in doubtful exigences should repair as to the divine oracles of God . 

But seeing they cannot , it is not a groundless , or doubtful title of an ambassador , or gospel-minister , that in case of a public civil breach of conscience towards men , that should free them from punishment , when yet liberty of conscience , in doubtful matters of faith towards God , remain still as a rock unmovable ? Therefore i verily think , the day of God's just visitation , spoken of in Hosea , is come upon these men , in that he hath given up these deviners and spiritual persons , to a dog-raging * madness , each pretended prophet , like fools , not knowing the seasons & interchangeable workings of the almighty . But i spare them , as objects for our pity and prayers , rather than envy , since through their words already , which everywhere frets like a gangreen , this their madness is in a manner seen and known of all men . 

Fiftly and lastly , the way to promote a blessed settlement in the civil state ▪ is for our honourable rulers not as magistrates , by any coercive power to settle an ecclesiastical * government , but as Christians eminent in their places , through a prudent and godly example to improve their utmost abilities , to restore the church to her former beauty , and then shall they be indeed the repairers of the Antichristian breach , and restorers of the ancient paths for saints to walk in ; so shall God bless their government with Potiphar for a Joseph's sake , and as he did the house of Obed Edom for the arks sake . But it will be demanded , what is the government nearest to the word of God , since one saith , here it is , others there , and some that there is none at all ? I have already showed that God in all ages hath had a visible church , and that cannot be without a government , although it hath not been alike always in form , nor visibility , but as for that visibility of a national church , it having neither matter nor form according to the primitive institution ; it 's a government more in name then in reality , the times of the apostles being then our pattern . I shall therefore in this last series of my discourse , as a second branch of the last particular , first , sum up all that hath been said touching this primitive ecclesiastical constitution of government , in a compendious form , as it was then held forth . And then secondly , the grounds and reasons of the first defection and apostacle from the same . And lastly , propound some means to re-estate the same in its former pureness . As for the first , i think i cannot do better than only word for word to circumscribe what that author hath set down touching the same , in the shrill cry , where after he had showed that the covenant did not require conformity to a national church , because the word of God acknowledgeth no other , but that one visible Catholic church , which is in all nations dispersed into congregations and families , that congregation then , saith he , or family wheresoever it is , that in matter , form , doctrine , or discipline , shall conform to theprimitive institution , that must needs be the purest church , which we are bound by covenant to hold forth in these nations , and that is conceived to be this : when at the first , by the preaching the sincere word of the gospel , so many as heard it that were convinced of their lost estate , by reason of sin , were incited thereby publicly to profess repentance from dead works , and faith towards God through the Lord Jesus , desiring thereupon to be baptised into the visible church , and under his government , to obey both in doctrine and discipline , what they shall clearly be persuaded to be his will , and for that end frequently to meet in their several assemblies , and there orderly and decently exercise each others gifts , for the edification one of another , in their most holy faith , that so upon very good experience had upon such gifts , they Might out of themselves , and for themselves successively choose , as they stood in need , pastors and other officers as they conceived necessary to the well-being and governing those who had voluntarily submitted themselves thereunto , so that then doubtless this constitution , would have continue as a pattern to all succeeding congregations those extraordinary messengers only excepted , that by their miracles showed their authority from God , to lay this foundation , and prescribe the form for this spiritual building , thus far the shrill cry . but for the second , touching the first grounds of apostasy , its evident , that from those very times this defection began , the apostle John testifying , that there was then many antichrists , which by their carriages , doctrines , and cunning practices , did deny the coming of Christ in the flesh , which was in truth no less than to deny both the father and the son , for he that doth deny the end of Christ's coming , which was to redeem , enlighten , fanctifie , rule and govern his church after his own mind : doth in effect deny his very coming , as also both father and son , and is a very Antichrist . To this also the apostle Paul gives testimony , that then this mystery of iniquity began to work , which first appeared in the defection and apostasy of some of those instruments , that were first entrusted , and furnished with ability to preach the word , which afterward through a satanical pride , and corruption in judgement began to fall off from the true apostles , usurping authority , not only over them , but to reign as Kings over the consciences of the brethren , whom then they did in the next place , secondly seduce from the sincerity of the gospel , pretending yet to be the apostles of Christ , which Paul calls notwithstanding , false apostles , ministers of Satan , transformed into the appearance of angels of light , because indeed they had a zeal for God , after the righteousness of the law , but not according to knowledge , in that they could not distinguish between that active and passive righteousness of the law and gospel , the one requiring and exacting obedience , when it gives no power to perform , the other freely giving a power to perform more than it at all times requires an exact performance to . 

Besides from the womb of this error proceeded many more , for as in the law so in the gospel , there is such a concatination of gospel truths , that an error in one foundation truth causeth the like in others . So that by falling off to the law though they did profess faith in Christ . They had no benefit thereby , through the neglect of the gospel , either of an effectual vocation , justification , true sanctification , or glorificaon , which was only in this as God's way to be found . The apostle to the Gallatians testifying , that notwithstanding their profession of faith in Christ , in that they preferred man's righteousness before gods , they were yet in their sins , Christ's death was in vain to them . And that all his benefits should profit them nothing , which is as was said , all one to them as if they had denied Christ's coming in the flesh . And then thirdly having lost the purity of the gospel , they fell also from the form and discipline of the same , preferring circumcision , before baptism , not assembling themselves as formerly , refusing communion and fellowship , with those purer churches , despising and contemning those sacraments , which presented the benefits of Christ's body and blood , insomuch as the apostle said in way of reproof , that if a temporal death followed the breach of one of Moses laws , how much shall he be guilty of a sorer punishment , which by the neglect of gospel truths , and ordinances , trample under foot the blood of the son of God . Finally , after this , corruption in doctrine , there was so great a departure from the faith , that there followed as universal a corruption in manners , and then the man of sin , the Antichrist not long after came indeed to be revealed ) whose only work was , to set himself against and above Christ , in all his gospell-ministrations , confounding all primitive order , and form both of doctrine and discipline , admitting none but himself and his corrupt clergy to be sole judges in matters of faith , which did assume to themselves only the name of the holy church , that so he Might the better sit in the consciences of those he calls the laity , as if it belonged not to them , either to know or receive any benefit by Christ , through a faith of their own , over which he did so Lord it , that he compelled them contrary to their own light implicitly to believe and obey , many times those things that were both contrary to nature , law , and gospel . Which together with many more horrid abominations , that for brevity sake is here remitted . 

So then by this , such a thick , and close darkness covered the eyes of the persons , that very few had in those days any true understanding in the mystery of the gospel ; the gospel then being turned into the law , and other human traditions , and when that darkness began a little to be expelled about Luther's time , yet by and by after , there was again such a confused mixture , of the law and gospel , that it was hard to say which was either : which * Luther indeed prophetically foretold should come to pass , through the ignorance of ministers after his time , which since by woeful experience we have found too true , that covering cherub of Antichristian darkness , still in a great part remaining . 

Thus having showed in the second place , the rise , groweth , and cause , of continuance of this first defection , it remains now that some means be propounded , according to the third particular , for the reinstating the same unto its primitive pureness , which now Might more generally and easily be effected , if God shall be pleased to give first to our magistrates and then more generally to others , a heart to follow the council of our Lord and head Christ Jesus , given to the church of Ephesus in another case , which consisteth in three things . First to remember from whence we are fallen , that is to say , from the primitive constitution . Secondly to repent of all contrary ways and abominable apostasies . Thirdly , to do our first works that is , to conform in all things to the mind of Christ , which was from the beginning , for we ought in this ecclesiastical government , as in the other , to make God's aim and end , in such a spiritual constitution our own , which if we would do , we must subscribe to his wisdom , accounting it ours , to follow his direction in the same . We read that Moses in building the tabernacle , a figure of the Jewish church he should do all things according to the pattern . Even so now , if we would build this spiritual tabernacle that is fallen down , so as that the residue of men Might seek after God , it must be according to the platform laid down by Christ , and his apostles , who was faithful in all things as a son , over his own house : and truly it were well , if after the same manner , and way of defection and apostasy we so hastily declined downward , we Might now more liesurely step by step ascend up again into this holy mountain . 

And here then is first to be considered according to that which hath been formerly hinted , that is to say , the foundation being laid and confirmed by miracles , there was afterwards no need of a succession of extraordinary messengers or miracles , which was at first to confirm the truth of the gospel among heathens and infidels , that then , which was to continue to posterity , unto which if we will conform it is necessary . 

First , that all distinctions brought in by Antichrist , of persons , in reference to human learning , so as to make an imparity touching the office of the ministry , be laid aside , renounced , and repent of . As also that custom of laying on of hands , for the formal constitution of any gospel minister , as if he were thereby better enabled to preach the truth , be also omited , since the apostles in their laying on of hands did convey not ordinary , but extraordinary gifts . 

Secondly , that in regard of our late confusion there Might be appointed a certain number , that for their abilities in the knowledge of the mystery of the gospel , as also reputed to be of an holy and unblamable conversation , every way qualified according to the rule of the apostle 

Thirdly that these with the assistance of godly magistrates and other Christians Might make choice in all parts , without respect of persons , so many as they have good experience of their abilities , agreeing not only in doctrine and discipline , but with boldness and other parts for an intelligible utterance , that they Might be sent forth into all places where there is need , to preach the sincere word of the gospel , and to perform other offices of the ministry without the intermeddling with the civil government . 

Fourthly , that all Christians which shall live within the compass of their ministry , being convinced of the truth of baptism , Might by initiation , be first congregated into a church fellowship . And then that all others , as the ministry of the gospel shall be made effectual , Might after profession of repentance , &c. be still added to each particular visible congregation , according to the several divisions , either of parishes or places equally divided by authority of magistracy , all others , without such a profession and way of admittance , to be accounted as without . 

Fiftly that besides the public directory for worship , and ordinance of public preaching for converting of men , some other day Might be permitted , or weekly allowed , answerable to the first practice for the meeting of the saints in the participation of ordinances , as also for an orderly and decent exercise of each others gifts , that so by frequent custom their wits through exercise Might discern things that differ , that so upon very good experience had of the manifold wisdom of God seen in the saints , they Might not hastily ( As they do now in some churches otherwise commendable ) choose out their officers , especially the pastors , publicly to preach , which Might successively supply the place of those that should decease , or otherwise be employed . 

Sixtly , that all doubtful points about the trinity or others , Might by fair and meek disputes especially writing be endeavoured to be cleared to vulgar understandings , as things not to be i•posed without a clear conviction , for writing is more advantageous in that many times for want of boldness , quickness of wit , strength of memory , distempered passions , or present assistance , the truth hath been suspended , and the contrary error retained , when by writing such defaults in nature by deliberation May be prevented , and as for enforcing , it ought not to be for these reasons , in that all intelects are not create of one size , all have not one and the same outward means , not the same exercise , not the same impediments to hinder , not the same internal divine assistance , not alike in darkness through negligence , prejudice , willfulness . Lastly , all are not by reason thereof given up to ajudiciary * blindness . 

Seventhly , that such ministers that are employed for the publication of the gospel , out of some public stock , Might have an equal and considerable allowance , that so they May give themselves wholly to the work of t•e ministry . These and other things seriously pondered and put in practice , it would i believe suddenly put an end to all our differences , whether civil or ecclesiastical , it being according to our covenant , a government indeed the nearest to the word of God , and the best reform churches , wherein all the faithful by what nicknames soever distinguished , ought thereunto unanimously to accord ; and as for all those persons that hold tenants destructive to known principles , or a common profession of faith , that in every thing should be clear not doubtful , are not at first ( In any congregation to be admitted ) or if corrupted after by excommunication cast out ▪ where they remain till manifestation of repentance , ( As heathens and publicans ) which yet still had a propriety in what was theirs in outward things , but if any such persons shall yet pertinaciously maintain such opinions , contrary to the light of nature , reason , and the plain letter of the scripture , to the disturbance of the public peace , they are under the power of the magistrate to punish . 

But to conclude , these things being of so great importance , although for brevity sake , i can but touch each particular here inserted . Let us every one now in our several places and callings lay aside all envy and bitterness , superfluity of naughtiness , that so through meekness and love , we May promote the good of church and state , so shall God be our King and dwell amongst us , and bless us , so that we need not to fear if the whole earth were gathered together against us , since he is an all-sufficient refuge to his persons , as by good experience we have already found , but if we still go on perversely , and oppose him in making factions to carry on private interests , against his peculiar interest , which is the good and welfare of this church and state , in the behalf of his saints , he will certainly break us to pieces , so as we shall be a scorn and by word to nations . Oh then that our governors would act their part herein , for who knows but they Might be distinguished and separated thus unexpectedly from their brethren , and exalted to the high place of judicature for such a time , and season , and work as this , which if they shall not now as wise and godly men improve , they and their houses shall certainly perish : when yet deliverance shall come to God's persons some other way . 

Secondly , i wish also that all royalists which hath seen the hand of God lifted up against them and their King , not withstanding all fair glosses on foul matters , would now sit down and consider these are the days of Christ's exaltation in his saints , to whom belongeth , not only the kingdom , but the greatness of the kingdom , for ever and ever . 

Thirdly , i desire that all levellers , which in most of their requests hath been already satisfied , that they would not now go about to destroy , what formerly they have endeavoured to * build ; but rather quietly sit down and see what gradually God will do amongst us . 

Fourthly , that all presbyters that are so violent for a government , as indeed one there ought to be , would comply in this , which is conceived to be nearest to the word of God , which in many particulars agreeth with that by them held forth . And then 

Fifthly , by this , i suppose , our brethren of Scotland , that cry up the covenant , as a thing not in any human power to dissolve , will be satisfied , since sectaries , by them so spoken against , are in the right way suppressed , yet is that which they call through ignorance , heresy , the true way of worshipping the god of our fathers , 

But i wish they had alike performed the covenant with us , the letter of which is either conditional in reference to the King or other delinquents , or with restrictions , touching reformation in the church , &c. besides , why not in man to dissolve ? Since that which is not in his lawful power to do : namely rashly to mix sacred things with profane , must needs be in his power upon more serious thoughts to undo , neither is there any condition to make this covenant perpetual as i read in the fame . But surely Scotland will no : through their sense of the covenant pick a quarrel , and ungratefully invade their brethren in England , which if , the Lord who hath showed himself on our side , will again i doubt nor decide the controversy . Lastly , by such government the civil state will be settled , Antichrist destroyed , profane converted , the gentiles fullness accomplished , the Jews through emulation thereat restored , and so then Christ's second coming will be hastened . Even so come Lord Jesus , come quickly .
