The wonder of a kingdom , dedicated to the junto at Westminster . 

Rascal reformers , snowy devils , 
Behold the period of your evils 
Draws nigh , ere yet the dogged star 
Cease to inflame the hemisphere 
You shall taste vengeance , and be sent 
To hell for ample punishment : 
Your blue-capped brethren swear they 'll be 
The whips shall yerk your treachery ; 
Your navie's gone , your credit 's lost , 
Those are your foes , once lend you most 
Your sumpter horses of the city , 
Cry pox take this damned state-committee : 
Your army moulders , and from all 
Points of the compass comes your fall . 
Oh strange ! the ballad-makers dare 
To say , you slaves and traitors are , 
The fates are just that made you thus 
Even to the rustics odious : 
Hobnails and clouted shoes 't is you 
Are the brave boys , the feat must do ; 
To your enraged fury we 
Leave treason and disloyalty .

The wonder of a kingdom . 

Hark ! how loud the citizen's murmur ! how rigidly the countries complain ! how deeply the seamen threaten ! how resolutely the Scots resolve ! how wretchedly Fairfax and his saints bemoan themselves ! and how desperately the junto at Westminster engage , blaspheming their god , and cursing their King ! what denotes all this ? 

This shows great Charles not broken by his fall , 
Nor must be hurried to his funeral 
Without resistance , since the people's eyes 
Are fixed all upon his second rise , 
That conscience is not banished , law'gone post , 
That yet Astraea harbours in our coast ; 
That the Egyptian states no Goshen have 
No patent for to shield them from the grave , 
But must wade to their Babel deep in blood , 
Which from each quarter swells into a flood : 
No passage for them to the holy land , 
Because the red sea does divided stand , 
If they would fly , the sea must be their tomb 
And bury them in amphitrites womb ; 
Providence irresistible hath decreed 
They shall scape water on the land to bleed ; 
This shows the fumes of bold ambition 
Makes their souls reel and dash against a stone , 
The rocks of Charles his greatness splits the knaves , 
They sink , as if in the Agaean weaves : 
This shows the city-ass on whom doth ride , 
The two most cursed copartners , reason and pride , 
Is tired with eating thistles and would fain 
Feed at the royal manger once again . 
This shows the seamen now will steer aright , 
And that the saints against Colchester that fight , 
Of storms and tempests have their bellies full , 
Since Lucas sported with a fiery bull . 
This shows the junto are assigned to fall , 
And dogs shall celebrate their funeral ; 
This uncouth change , but happy fate to see , 
May well the wonder of a kingdom be . 
Those shallow Sciolists , who like materia prima , comprehend in their minds all variety of impressions , willingly part with their ideas ; those nomalists who taught we erred except we went astray , now preach there can be no tranquillity without order and discipline : those that had their hands chiefly in the setting up of the Dagon of presbytery , now put to their whole strength to break it to pieces on the threshold of ashod : those that were for a parliament without a King , are now on fire to have a King without a parliament ; those that worshipped democracy , now adore monarchy ; those that tore and rent the book of common prayer , now grow weary of praying , ex tempore ; those that termed the surplice the whore of Babylon's smock , now esteem it as the emblem of purity : those that would fly from a maypole adorned with garlands as from the droppings of an alder-tree , now censure their own folly for condemning such indifferent objects ; those that taxed David of heresy for extolling the music of the church , now confess the organs yield a heavenly melody , and inspire the mind with celestial rhapsodies , those that formerly esteemed it no less than the highest superstition , to kneel when they received the sacrament of the Lord's body , now will not deny , but there ought to be reverence given , as well external as internal : those that divulged it for horrible sin to bow at the name of their dear saviour , now will acknowledge , that is no more than is requisite : those that before preached it impiety to sign infants with the seal of the cross , and were of opinion that they Might baptize them themselves , even in their chimney-corners , now cry out , that the cross is the Christians badge , and that they have incurred the pains of hell for their horrid profanation of that holy sacrament , as even at this present , a weaver in London , whose name i shall not divulge , because i hope the man ( If desperation do not too much get the upperhand ) May yet be a faithful and conformable member of the church : this man a fiery zealor of the anabaptistical sect , of great reverence and esteem amongst them as one of their prime prophets , whether out of a desire of glory , and to be of singular estimation amongst those of his fraternity , or whether the devil ( Which is most probbable ) forced him forward to do an act which Might confirm those erring sectaries in their erroneous principles , and so to noose them yet faster : however it was , this fellow one night having invited at least 12. or 14. of those of his own tribe , whom he thought were the most simple , and would the soonest be deluded with a fallacy , to a supper , which they celebrated in an upper room , after all his guests were all seated , and began to fall to their meat , suddenly he begun to be in a wonderful ecstasy , he writhed his face , rolled his eyes , foamed at mouth , and seemed to be as one transported beyond himself to the great terror & amazement of his simple friends whom he beckoned with hands ( Seeming ) not able to speak signifying they should kneel down to prayers the credulous coxcombs did so , trembling so extremely that their knees knocked one against another , suddenly beneath them they heard a rumbling terrible noise and withal many fatal shrieks and dreadful groans which almost put them beside their w•tss , ( As since they have confessed ) their hair stood an end on their heads and they looked each minute to be swallowed , the noise still continue , when the weaver seemed a little to recover himself , after a while returning to his wanted temper he began to speak comfortably to his aguish brethren , exhorting them not to be daunted , this knowing , that none could come to any evil beneath his roof , he having no less than an whole legion of angels to wait upon him , and therefore he desired them to sit still ( if it were possible ) untroubled , au• he would presently make a discovery according as God had revealed un - to him : all which his comfortable sayings very little or nothing abated the fear of his quivering brethren , than he proceeded to read a chapter , which he told them was of sufficient efficacy to quell the fury of devils and serpents , after that he gave out a psalm , requesting them to sing after him , which alas they were altogether unable to do , their jaws being almost torn in sunder by the hand of fear , at last after a most solemn invocation he stooped down , & in the name of God made inquiry , what spirit or angel of darkness it was ; that caused that terrible tumult , after which words the noise and yellings greatly increased , and then on the sudden quite taken away , the murmuring sound of a drum was heard , the weaver still plying his demands , received this answer . 

that the shade or ghost of John Reinolds , that worthy man of God was come beneath his roof , where he met with great opposition by divers damned souls , who enclosed him about with yelling noise whom he had now dissipated , they being the souls of such and such ( naming the party ) who had been greatly opposite against their way , and he was sent to tell him , that there was a great persecution shortly to be expected , against which he ought to arm himself , as also to advertise the whole society , that it was the pleasure of the Lord that they should fight for the maintenance of their religion , which was signified by that drum , the noise whereof he heard ; after this was said , the spirit departed ; the weaver turning him about to his guests , began to say unto them , brethren , you all see how acceptable my services are in the eyes of the Lord , that he is pleased to signify his mind so largely unto me , all which you May declare unto our brethren , as you shall have occasion ? And so after some other talk the man departed home , and the next day they declared the wondrous things that had been and heard , which was occasioned thus , the waver bound one of his servants , by an oath of secrecy never to reveal ( Though since he hath broke it ) the stratagem , and with many gifts and fair promises hired him to place himself at that hour of the night between the boards , and the sealing , taking with him a cat whose legs he had tied together with sharp pricks between , who upon his pulling of a string made a strange and horrid noise , with extremity of pain &c.  Upon the rumor of this miraculous revelation , the weaver grew greatly to be esteemed of amongst those of his society , till on a time his man betrayed the secret , which yet those pestilent sectaries seek to hide for their credit sake , this fellow lately confessed of his own accord , that he hath baptised many children by the fire side , for which his conscience now so much upbraids him , that he remains distraught , crying out he is damned , he is damned , and must go to hell for ever and ever ; i hope the reader will pardon this large digression , it being so pertinent to our discourse : i say this fellow finds how wretchedly he hath fooled himself even unto the brink of hell , and i hope he May yet live to be a penitent convert ; but to our matter , 't is very strange and wonderful to see how of late men's minds are come about , like mill horses ; they have gone round this seven years , and are now arrived at the same station where first they set out . 

How fast at first the Hydra multitude , 
Who neither are with wit , or sense endued ; 
Run to their ruin , but let that fault die , 
And ever perish in a lethargy : 
how are the junto madded for to see 
Their soon regained love to loyalty ! 
This very thing strikes to their hearts more fear 
Than thunder in the trembling Indian's ear : 
The persons see their error , they not theirs , 
Since peace and loyalty are their equal fears ; 
And to speak truth , having primarily placed the cause in God's almighty & excellent providence , the rebels have brought these calamities upon their perjured pates by their own greedy desire of dominion , by their palpable treachery to his majesty , and by their trampling upon , and squeezing the purses both of peers and persons to enrich their own paivate coffers , they could not be contented to keep their King in prison , contrary to all laws both divine and human , except they also murdered him , they could not be contented to thrust out all those their fellow-members , that refused to join with them in their treasonable , perfidious , disloyal , bloody barbarous and unparalleled undertakings , unless they also sequestered their estates to a penny , exposing them to all manner of wants and miseries , yea sometimes to such penury , that they have been compelled to beg their means of life , they esteemed it not sufficient to draw in the persons by a state-trick , to gull them into rebellion by fair and specious pretences , & buzzing in their ears false & needless jealousies , to the involving of them in a long & bloody war , unless they also put bits in their mouths , & saddles on their backs , & getting astride upon them to ride them to death , they could not be contented to have abrogated all law and equity , all judgement & justice , unless they also introducted all manner of illegal impositions corrupted all courts of judicature , perverted the course of justice , & left the persons ( In case of never so grievous an outrage ) without hope of any redress , till the resurrection . 

It would astonish a man almost beyond belief , to cogitate from what an height those bloody rebels are fallen within the space almost of a month , in so little a time to forfeit what they had got together for the space of 7. years with infinite expense of blood and coin , is very strange & remarkable ; yea such a metamorphosis as could not have been wrought by any human power , without God's immediate providence , those that were Masters of a kingdom some days since , are now great in nothing but their fears ; the navies revolted ( As they call it ) or rather returned to the allegiance they owe unto their King , that they sink not in that sea of blood in which they swum to their hopes , during the long and cruel war , now have quite deserted them and wait but an opportunity to show their teeth , the generallity of the kingdom , who for many years looked upon them as gods , now behold them as devils , their brethren who have all along , kept a fair correspondency with them , and jointly prosecuted the war , now are come against them with their swords in their hands , resolving to take vengeance upon them as perfiddious traitors , and traitorous miscreants , the reasons and grounds of this wonderful change are these . 

First , when they ( Being puffed up with pride and overweening thoughts ) imagined all was their own by sea , as well as by land , would needs new model the navy , put forth and put in whom they listed , issuing out all orders and signing all their mandates in their own name ( A villainy never attempted by any but them , not so much as naming his majesty's person or power , the Master's captains and mariners of ships took it in extreme dungeon now perceiving their intents were in all things to make themselves a free state , first they murmured in private after they took sides , and lastly openly declared themselves against the treachery of the rebels , turned the skippers boy rainsbro•ugh their mock admiral on shore set sail for Holand to proffer their service to their true admiral the Duke of York , protesting to live and die for his majesty , in which condition they now remain at present . 

Secondly , the citizens of London having a long season like fools and knaves hazarded their lives and drained their estates , for defending and usurped greatness perceiving now at last that they have but nourished serpents in their bosoms who value them no longer than they May prey upon them , and have left them in the lurch without performance o• the least thing they romised , leaving them open to the outrages of a plundering bloody sectarian army , they resolve no longer to be the protectors of such villainies , but to repent of what they have done restrain their aid for the future , and to pull down the aspiring Nimrodes , from the top of their greatness . 

With them the kingdom do combine , 
And all the ellements do join : 
Brave citizens stand firm and we 
Will soon restore his majesty . 
Shall Colchester alone win praise , 
And shall not London share the bays ? 
Join hands and hearts , to pluck down those , 
Are both the Kings , and kingdom's foes ; 
And let the after ages tell 
We sank these traitors into hell . 
Even when with pride their souls did reel 
Even when they grasped fortunes wheel ; 
Sink traitors sink , for in your fall , 
Our pressures have their funeral . 
Finis .
