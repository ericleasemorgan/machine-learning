DEAT● DANCE . 

To be sung to a pleasant new tune , cal●●● O no , no , no , not yet , or , the meadow brow . 



If Death would come and show his face , 
as he dare show his power , 
And sit at many a rich man's place , 
both every day and hour . 
He would amaze them every one , 
to see him standing there , 
And wish that soon he would be gone , 
from all their dwellings fair . 
Or if that Death would take the pains , 
so go to the water side , 
Where Merchauts purchase golden gains 
to prank them up in pride . 
And bid them think upon the poor , 
or else I●le see you soon , 
There would be given then at their door , 
good alms , both night and noon . 
Or walk into the Royal-exchange , 
when every man is there , 
no doubt his coming would be strange , 
to put them all in fear . 
How they do worldly buy and sell , 
to make their markets good , 
Their dealings all would prospero well , 
if so the matter stood . 
Or if Death would take the pains , 
to go to Paul's one day , 
To talk with such as there remains , 
to walk and not to pray . 
Of life they would take lasting Lease , 
though ne'er so great a Fine , 
What is not that , but some would give , 
to set them up a Shrine . 
If Death would go to Westminster , 
to walk about the Hall , 
And make himself a Counsellor , 
in pleas amongst them all . 
I think the Court of Conscience , 
would have a great regard , 
When Death should come with diligence , 
to have their matters heard . 
For Death hath been a Chequer man , 
not many yéeares ago , 
And he is such a one as can , 
bestow his checking so . 
That never a Clerk within the Hall. 
can argue so his case , 
But Death can overrule them all , 
in every Court and place . 
If Death would keep a tippling house , 
where Roisters do resort , 
And take the cap , and drink , carouse , 
when they are in their sport . 
And briefly say , my Masters all , 
why stand you idle here , 
I bring to you Saint Gibs his bowl , 
't wold put them all in fear . 
If Death would make a step to dance , 
where lusty Gallants be , 
Or take dice , and throw a chance , 
when he doth gamesters see . 
And say , my Masters , Have at all , 
I warrant it will be mine . 
They would in amazement fall , 
to set him any Coin , 
If Death would Gossip now and then , 
amongst the crabbed Wives , 
That taunts and rails at their good men , 
to make them weary lines . 
It would amaze them , I might say , 
so spitefully to boast : 
That they will be●are the swing and sway , 
and overrule the roast . 
If Death would quarterly but come , 
amongst the Landlord's crew , 
And take a count of every sum , 
that rises more than de●e . 
As well of Income , as of Fine , 
above the old set Rent . 
They would let Leases Without Coin , 
for fear they should be shent . 
If Death would take his daily course , 
where Tradesmen sell their Ware , 
His welcome sure would be ma●● worse , 
than those of money's bare , 
It would affright them for to see , 
his lean and hollow looks , 
If Death should say , come show to me , 
my reckoning in your books . 
If Death would thorough the Markets trace 
where Conscience used to dwell , 
And take but there a Hucksters place , 
he might do wondrous well . 
High prizes would abated be , 
and nothing sound too dear , 
When Death should call , Come buy of me , 
would put them all in fear . 
If Death would prove Gentleman , 
and come to court our Dames , 
And do the best of all he can , 
to blazon forth their names . 
Yet should he little welcomes have , 
amongst so fair a crew , 
That daily go so fine and brave , 
when they his face do view . 
Or if he would but walk about , 
our City Suburbs round , 
There would be given him out of doubt 
full many a golden pound . 
To spare our wanton female crew , 
and give them longer day : 
But Death will grant no Leases new , 
but take them all away . 
For Death hath promised to come , 
and come he will indeed , 
Therefore I warn you all and some , 
beware and take good heed . 
For what you do , or what you be , 
he 's sure to find and know you , 
Though he be blind , and cannot see , 
in earth he will bestow you . 
FINIS .
