To the virtuous , his much esteemed friend , Mrs. Elizabeth Stock . 

Loving friend , 

Though i was put upon some straits of time , ( Other occasions intervening when this sermon was to be preached ) yet at your request to me to publish it , and the desire of some of your relations to whom i stand obliged , i knew not how in civility to deny . The subject of this following discourse , is , the saints desire to be with Christ ; and surely if Christ be all in all , col. 3. 11. all marrow and sweetness , no wonder that they who can claim a propriety , desire possession , and thirst after the embraces of that dear saviour , in whose presence is fullness of joy * as touching the present sad providence wherewith the Lord hath exercised you , let not your heart despond ; though God allows you tears , yet you May not mourn without hope , nor beyond measure ; let them that weep , be as if they wept not , 1 cor. 7. 30.  If God hath given you Christ , you have enough , you need not envy any living , or overgrieve him who is dead * ; the starlight of relations is superabundantly recompensed with the golden beams of this sun of righteousness . if these few lines ensuing May do good to any , adding some holy oil to the flame of their affections , ungluing them from the world , and fixing their hearts more upon the Lord Jesus , i have what i aimed at ; i shall leave all to the blessing of the almighty , and rest , 

from my study at Stephens Walbrook . novemb . 3. 1658.  Yours , in all Christian service , Thomas Watson .

Philipp . 1. 23.  

For i am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ which is far better . 



We are met to solemnize the funerals of our friend deceased , and so perform the last office of love . A glass of mortality is here set before us , wherein we May see our own fragile condition . There is a sentence passed upon us all ; statutum est , — it is appointed unto men once to die , heb. 9 27.  So that our life is but a short Reprieval from death , which is granted to a condemned man . 

A wise man's life ( Saith Plato ) is nothing else but a contemplation of death . The Lord would have us enure ourselves to dying thoughts , * and as it were by meditation often to stretch ourselves upon our death bed . God clothed our first parents with skins of dead beasts , and feeds us with dead flesh , that so often as we see the death of other creatures , we Might not forget our own . 

The text presents to us saint Paul in an holy pathos , or fit of longing to be with Christ . His heart was with Christ , and he wanted only the swift wing of death to carry him thither . i am ( Saith he ) in a straight betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and be with Christ , which is far better . 

I shall briefly explain the terms as they lie in order . 

i am in a straight betwixt two . 

{non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , i am hemmed in , * it May allude to a castle which is so straitly beleaguered and hemmed in , that it hath no way to make a sally out . * it fared now with saint Paul , as with a woman that hath her children at home with her , and her husband beyond the seas , she would fain be with her husband , yet loathe to leave her children : so Paul would gladly have been with Christ , but was loathe to leave the Philippians , his spiritual children . 

having a desire to depart . 

1.  The apostle doth not say oportet , i must depart , but cupio , i desire to depart . All men must depart . * 

— Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas regumque turres . * — 

There is a dying principle in all ; the frame and contexture of their body is earthly , and tends to a dissolution . Nebuchadnezar's image , though it had an head of gold , yet feet of clay , dan. 2. 23.  Take the strongest man , let him be Samson or Hercules , of whom we May say as the poet , — Illi robur & as triplex circa pectus erat . — 



Yet he stands upon feet of clay ; he is but pulvis animatus , and must moulder away in time , death will come with an habeas corpus at last . Tamerlain a Scythian captain , the terror of his time , died with three fits of an ague . * 

The grammarian who declines all other nouns , knows not how to decline death . is my strength ( Saith Job ) the strength of stones ? Job 6. 12.  Suppose it were , yet , — gutta cavat lapidem , — the continual dropping of sickness would in time wear away this stone . There is no such thing as an earthly eternity ; death is called the house appointed for all living , Job 30. 23.  

But though death be in itself necessary , to saint Paul it was voluntary ; it was not so much a debt , as a vote ; * not so much Paul's task , as his choice ; he doth not say , i must be dissolved , but i would be dissolved . having a desire to depart . 

2.  The apostle doth not say , having a desire to die , but to depart ; [ a lenifying word ] which doth much take off the sharp edge of death , and make it less formidable . This phrase [ to depart ] {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} May refer 

1.  To soldiers that pitch their tents in the field , and upon the least word of command from their general , loosen the cords of their tent , and pluck up the stakes , and March forward . * so death doth but loosen the silver cord , * which fastened the soul in its earthly tent , and a Christian Marcheth forward to the heavenly Canaan . 

Or , 2.  This word [ to depart ] May be a metaphor taken from mariners , who loosen anchor that they May sail from one port to another : * so Paul desired to loosen anchor ; death to a believer is but loosning the anchor , and sailing from one port to another , from earth to heaven . 

Beza renders this word [ to depart ] a putting off the harness . * Hierom reads it , migrare ex hospitio . the world is an inn , we are travellers who take up our lodging here for a night , Paul longed to be out of his inn . 

and to be with Christ . 

The apostle had three great desires , and they were all centred upon Christ . One was to be found in Christ ; * the other was to magnify Christ ; * the third was to be with Christ . * 

Here observe two things . 

1.  Paul doth not say i desire to depart and be in heaven , but to be {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} with Christ ; it is Christ's presence makes heaven , * as the King's presence makes the court . 't is not the cherubims or Seraphims which make paradise ; the lamb is the light thereof , rev. 21. 23.  

2.  From the connexion of the words , having a desire to depart and to be with Christ ; we clearly see that the soul of a believer doth not sleep in the body after death , ( A drowsy opinion ) but goes immediately to Christ . * upon the divorce of the soul from the body , there follows an espousal of the soul to Christ , 2 cor. 5. 8.  Absent from the body , present with the Lord . * it were better for believers to stay here , if they did not presently go to Christ after death . For here the saints are daily improving their graces , here they have many praelibamina , sweet tastes of God's love , so that it were better to stay here ; and Paul wished that which would be to his loss , if the soul should sleep in the body , and not go immediately after death to Christ . * 

which is far better . 

{non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , a believer is no loser by death . His change is for the better ; a science that is grafted into a better stock , and planted in a better soil is no ways damnified . A believer after death is set into a better stock , Christ ; and is planted in a better soil , heaven ; this can be no loss , but an advantage . Well therefore May the apostle say , to be with Christ is far better . 

In the words there are these three parts . 1.  Saint Paul's choice ; to be with Christ . 2.  The excellency of his choice ; it is far better . 3.  The nodus , or the strait he was in ; coarctor , i am in a strait betwixt two ; this holy man was in a great dilemma , he was straitened between service and reward . * he was desirous of glory , yet willing to adjourn his own happiness , and stay out of heaven a while , that he Might be a means to bring others thither . * 

From the words thus opened , there are three observations . 

1.  It is the desire of a true saint to remove from hence , and be with Christ . 

2.  To be with Christ is far better ; how much better it is , we shall better understand when we are in heaven ; some angel is best able to speak to this point . 

3.  That which stays a saint here in the world , is a desire of doing service ; this did cast the balance with the apostle , and was the only tempting motive to keep him here awhile , he looked upon his abode in the flesh , as an opportunity of service . * Paul was willing to die , yet content to live , that he Might be a factor for Christ upon earth . 

I shall at this time insist upon the first proposition . that it is the desire of a true saint to remove from hence , and to be with Christ ; this proposition hath two branches ; of each distinctly . 

1.  It is the desire of a true saint to be gone from hence ; having a desire to depart . what a wicked man fears , that a godly man hopes for . I desire saith Paul to depart ; a sinner cries loathe to depart , he doth not say come Lord Jesus , but stay Lord Jesus ; he would live always here , he knows no other heaven but this , and 't is death to him to be turned out of his heaven . * it was the speech of Axiochus the philosopher when he was to die , shall i be deprived of this light ? shall i leave all my sweet delights ? * David calls death a going out of the world , psal. 39 13.  a wicked man doth not go out , but is dragged out ; he is like a tenant who hath gotten possession , and will not out of the house , till the sergeants pull him out . If a wicked man were put to his choice , he would never come where God is ; he would choose the serpent's curse , to eat dust , gen. 3. 14. but not return to dust . if a wicked man Might be voti compos , have his wish , he would serve no other god but his belly , * and to this he would ever liberally pour drink offerings . 

But a soul enlivened and ennobled with a principle of grace , looks upon the world as a wilderness wherein are fiery serpents , and he desires to get out of this wilderness . Simeon having taken Christ in his arms , cries out , Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , Luke 2. 29.  He that hath taken Christ in the arms of his faith , will sing Simeons' song , Lord , let thy servant depart . David prayed to know the measure of his days , psal. 39 4. because ( Saith Theodoret ) he desired to hear the good news of death's approach . * the saints of God have looked upon themselves as imprisoned in the body , and have longed for a jail delivery . * 

The bird desires to go out of the cage , though it be made of gold . * 

Hiliaron chides himself that he was no more willing to die ; go forth my soul , what fearest thou ? * 

Ignatius was desirous of martyrdom , that he Might gain the presence of Christ in glory . * 

A Christian of the right breed is ambitiously desirous to put off the earthly clothes of his body , & make his bed in the grave ; * how is this bed perfumed with Christ's lying in it ? A pillow of down , is not so sweet as a pillow of dust ; a regenerate person looking upon himself as held with the earthen fetter of the flesh , and his soul put into a movable sepulchre , * cries out with David , oh that i had wings like a dove , that i Might fly away and be at rest . psal. 55. 6.  

And indeed no wonder a true saint doth desire a dismiss , and is so earnest to have his pass to be gone from hence ; * if we consider how beneficial death is to a child of God , it puts a period to all his evils : in particular , there are ten evils that death will put an end to . 

1.  Death will put an end to a believers sins . Sin is the great incendiary , it doth us all the mischief . Sin May be compared to the planet Saturn , which hath a malignant influence ; it is the womb of our sorrows , and the grave of our comforts . * 

Sin is the sinner's bond , acts 8. 23. and the saints burden , psal. 38. 3.  How is a believer tired out with his corruptions ? i am weary of my life ( Saith Rebecca ) because of the daughters of Heth , gen. 27. 46.  That which makes a child of God weary of his life , is his proud , unbelieving heart : saint Paul could better carry his iron chain , than his sins ; oh wretched man that i am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? rom. 7. 24.  When grace spurs the soul forward , the curben bit of sin checks it , and pulls it back again . There is much of the old man in the new man ; * there is a party in every regenerate heart that is true to the devil ; a party that will not pray , that will not believe . A Christian is like a bowl with a double bias , he hath an earthly bias upon his will , and a spiritual bias , and these draw him several ways ; the evil i would not , that do i , rom. 7. 19  Sin mingles itself with our holy things ; we cannot act either our duties or our graces without sin ; we are like children who cannot write without blotting ! the sweet rose of grace doth not grow without its prickles ? * no wonder then a believer desires to depart ; death will free him from his spiritual distempers ; when he hath done breathing , he shall have done sinning . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . 

2.  Death will put an end to a believers tentations . Our whole life ( Saith Austin ) is nothing but a tentation ; * we tread upon snares : Satan is ever casting in the angle of a tentation , to see whether we will bite ; he knows how to suit his tentations ; he tempted Achan with a wedge of gold ; he tempted David with beauty ; we cannot lock the door of our heart so fast by prayer , but a tentation will enter : * sometimes Satan comes more furiously , as a red dragon ; sometimes more slily , as a serpent ; sometimes he baits his hook with scripture , and tempts to sin under a mask of religion , as when he tempts to evil , that good May come of it * . Thus can he transform himself into an angel of light . 

Is it not a grievous thing for a virgin to have her chastity daily assaulted ? Is it not sad to have the devil's bullets continually flying about our ears ? No wonder then a believer is willing to depart ; death will set him out of gunshot , he shall never be troubled with Satan's fiery darts any more ; though grace puts a child of God out of the devil's possession , it is death only frees him from the devil's tentation . 

3.  Death will put an end to a believers fears . Fear is the soul's palsy ; there is torment in fear , 1 John 4. 18.  Cicero calls fear one of the three plagues of mankind ; and the best of the saints {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , are haunted with this evil spirit ; they cannot rejoice without trembling ; the believer fears lest his heart should put a cheat upon him , he fears God doth not love him he fears lest he should tire in his March to heaven ; the best faith May sometimes have its fears , as the best stars have their twinkling . These fears ( As Socrates saith ) arm a man against himself ; they are very afflictive , leaving sad impressions of melancholy behind . No wonder then a believer longs to depart out of this life ; why should he fear that which frees him from fear ? the King of terror makes all fear vanish . 

4.  Death will dry up a believers tears , rev. 7. 17.  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; weeping is nothing but a cloud of sorrow gathered in the heart , dropping into water . A Christian often hath none to keep him company , but his own griefs and sorrows ; he sits as Israel by the rivers weeping ; as soon as the child is born , it weeps ; when Moses was born , he was laid in an ark of bulrushes , where he did as it were baptize himself with his own tears , exod. 2. 6.  And behold the babe wept ; ever since we looked upon the tree of knowledge , our eyes have watered ; there are many things to occasion weeping . 

— quidque facis lachrymis opus est . — 

1.  our sins ; who can look into his own heart with dry eyes ? 

2.  loss of relations , which is like the pulling a limb from the body ; Joseph wept over his dead father , gen. 50. 1.  well then , 't is not to be admired that a believer desires to depart from hence ; he shall leave the valley of tears ; the bottle of tears shall be stopped ; his water shall be turned into wine , his mourning into music , his lamentations into hallelujahs : death is the handkerchief to wipe off all tears . 

5.  Death will put an end to a believers molestations ; man is born to trouble , Job 5. 7. he is the natural heir to it . This life is subject to injury * ; we do not ( As Seneca saith ) finish our troubles while we live here , but change them . quisque suos patimur manes . every one hath his cross to carry ; sometimes poverty pincheth , sometimes sickness tortures , sometimes lawsuits vex ; man is like a tennis-ball , bandied up and down by providence ; while wicked men are in the world , never look for rest . These troubled seas ( As the prophet calls them ) * will be casting forth their foam and mire upon the godly ; and well then May a believer say his nunc dimittis , Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart . death gives a child of God his quietus est * , it sends him a writ of ease , Job 3. 17.  There ( That is , in the grave ) the wicked cease from troubling , and there the weary be at rest . 

6.  Death puts an end to a believers cares . Care is vexatious and anxious , it eats out the comfort of life ; the Greek word for care {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , comes from a primitive that signifies to cut the heart in pieces ; care doth fret as a canker , it discruciates the mind , it breaks the sleep , it wastes the spirits , this is the wrack which the soul is stretched upon . 't is hard , i had almost said impossible , to shake off this viper of care while we live ; all our comforts are careful comforts ; care is to the mind , as a burden to the back , it loads the spirits , and with overload sinks them ; care is a fruit of the curse ; Adam's want of care , hath brought us to care ; have you not sometimes seen the briar growing by the honeysuckle , so that you cannot well gather the honeysuckle , but you are scratched with the briar ? Thus in gathering riches , how is the head and heart pricked with care ? and is there not great reason why a child of God should desire to depart ? is it good being among the briars ? death is the cure of care ; we are thoughtful and solicitous how to get such an estate , how to provide for such a child ; now death comes to a believer as a friend , and saith , never perplex and distract thy mind thus , i will free thee from all these heart-killing cares ; i will strike but once , and that stroke shall relieve thee . 

7.  Death will put an end to the night of desertion ; thou didst hide thy face , and i was troubled , psal. 30. 7.  The soul in desertion , is within an inch of despair ; in affliction the world is against a man , in tentation Satan is against a man , in desertion God is against a man . Alstead calls desertion an agony of conscience ; * this made the prophet Jonah call the whale's belly the belly of hell , because he was deserted there ; Jonah 2. 2 , 4.  Out of the belly of hell cried i , than i said i am cast out of thy sight . 

Heman grew distracted upon the suspension of God's favour , psal. 88 16.  While i suffer thy terrors , i am distracted ; but death will free from desertion : a believer after death shall never see any more eclipses ; God will draw aside the curtain , and pull off his vail , and the soul shall be for ever sunning itself in the light of God's countenance . 

8.  Death will put an end to the imperfections of nature . Our natural knowledge is very imperfect ; the most perceptive , intelligent person , May say as Agur , prov. 30. 2.  i have not the understanding of a man . since the fall , the lamp of reason burns dim ; there are many arcana naturae , knots in nature that we cannot untie . Why Nilus should overflow in summer , when by the course of nature waters are lowest ; why the loadstone should incline to the pole star ; why the sea should be higher than the earth , yet not drown it . how the bones grow in the womb , eccles. 11. 5.  Many of these things are riddles and paradoxes ; by eating of the tree of knowledge , we have lost the key of knowledge ; * how are we maimed in our intellectuals ! by the fall we have lost our head-piece ; there are some diseases which would make Galen's head ache to find out . The river Euripus was too deep for Aristotle ; the poet could say , felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas . * — 



Socrates said on his deathbed , there were many things which he had yet to learn ; our knowledge is like the twilight , dim and duskish : the greatest part of our knowledge , is not so much as the least part of our ignorance , all which considered , no wonder to hear this language from a saint , cupio dissolvi , i have a desire to depart ; death crowns a Christian with fullness of knowledge ; when he is snuffed by death , the candle of his understanding will burn brighter ; at death a child of God doth perfectly recover the use of his reason . 

9  Death will put an end to the imperfections of grace ; our graces are our best jewels , but here they are in their infancy and minority ; therefore the saints are said to receive but primitias spiritus , the first fruits of the spirit , rom. 8. 23.  The best Christian is like a child put out to nurse , he is very weak in grace , faith is feeble , love lukewarm ; grace though it be not dead , it is sickly , rev. 3. 2.  Strengthen the things which are ready to die ; grace is like gold in the oar , drossy and impure ; the most refined soul hath some dregs ; this motto May be written upon a Christians graces ; — plurima desunt — he that shoots furthest in holiness , comes short of the mark of perfection * ; well than May a believer desire to be dissolved , death will free him from all the imperfections of his holiness ; it will make him pure as the angels , not having spot or wrinkle , ephes. 5. 27.  

10.  Death will put an end to a weary pilgrimage ; we are here in a pilgrim condition , 1 pet. 2. 11.  a Christian walks with his pilgrim's staff in his hand , the staff of the promise in the hand of faith ; * now death will put an end to this pilgrimage ; it takes away the pilgrim's staff , and sets a crown upon his head ; no wonder that the gracious soul cries out with saint Paul , having a desire to depart . 

object . but against this it May be objected , some of the saints have prayed against death ; Hezekiah when the message of death was brought , prayed against it , and wept sore , isa. 38. 2 , 3. so that Hezekiah had not a desire to depart . 

answ . 1.  Hezekiah did not pray simply against death , but in a limited sense , at that time ; there Might be several reasons assigned why at that time death was not welcome to him . 

As , 1.  Hezekiah desired to live awhile longer , that he Might do more work for God , ver. 38.  The dead cannot praise thee ; intimating , that if he had been then taken off by death , he was capable of doing God no more service ; he was loathe to be cut down , till he had born more fruit . Besides , had he then died in the infancy of reformation , the adversaries of God would have insulted , and made songs of triumph at his funeral . 

2.  Hezekiah was unwilling to die at that time , because he wanted issue . God had promised to David , 1 king. 8. 25.  that those of his line which were godly , should not want some of their seed to succeed them in the throne ; now in this respect it was a great discomfort to Hezekiah to die childless ; for he Might have thought himself no better than an hypocrite , inasmuch as God had promised issue to the Kings of David's line that feared him . Upon these , and other considerations , Hezekiah Might pray against death at that juncture of time . 

And whereas it May be said that many of God's children are unwilling to die . I answer , a Christian is a compounded creature , flesh and spirit , and from this composition there May be a conflict between the fear of death and the desire of death , but at last the spiritual part prevails ; and as faith grows stronger , fears grow weaker ; thus it was with Paul , having a desire to depart 

So much for the first branch of the doctrine , that it is the desire of a true saint to be gone from hence ; [ having a desire to depart . ] 

2.  I proceed now to the second branch of the doctrine , that it is a saints desire to be with Christ . Saint Paul longed to lie on that soft pillow where John the beloved disciple did , viz. the bosom of Jesus * ; there had been little comfort in departing , if the apostle had not put in this word , to be with Christ . death will make a glorious change to a believer ; 't is but crossing the mare mortuum , the dead sea , and he shall be with Christ . Death to a child of God is like the whirlwind to the prophet Eliah , it blew off his mantle , but carried the prophet up to heaven . So death is a boisterous wind which blows off the mantle foe the flesh , ( For the body is but the mantle the soul is wrapped in ) but it carries the soul up to Christ ; the day of a believers dissolution , is the day of his coronation . Though death be a bitter cup , here is sugar at the bottom , it translates the soul of a believer to Christ ; though the flesh calls death the last enemy , * yet faith calls it the best friend , it brings a man to Christ , which is far better . 

This word {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , to be with Christ , implies three things , Intuition . 
Fruition . 
Duration . 


1.  To be with Christ , implies , intuition , 1 joh. 3. 2.  we shall see him as he is ; here we see him as he is not ; he is not mutable , he is not mortal ; in heaven we shall see him as he is . When Socrates was to die , he comforted himself with this , that he should go to the place where he should see Homer and Musaeus , and other worthies who lived in the age before him . A believer May comfort himself with this , that he shall see Christ ; here we see him but through a glass darkly ; but what will it be , when he shall be bespangled in all his embroidery , and shall show forth himself in his full glory to his saints ! * he in Lucian said to his friend , i will show thee all the glory of Greece , when thou hast seen Solon , thou hast seen all : so he that sees Jesus Christ , sees all the glory of paradise , Christ being the mirror of beauty , the quintessence of happiness . 

Some ask the question how and in what manner we shall see Christ , whether we shall see his godhead with bodily eyes ? it is not good to be wise above what is written ; thus far i think May with modesty be asserted , that we shall with our bodily eyes , behold Christ's human nature ! his glory as a mediator shall be visible to the saints , and shall be beheld by glorified eyes ; in this sense that scripture is to be understood , Job 19 25. with these eyes shall i see God ; great and amazing will that glory be which shall sparkle from the human nature of Christ ; if his transfiguration was so glorious , * what will his inauguration be . Austin wished that he Might have seen three things before he died ; Paul in the pulpit , Rome in its glory , and Christ in the flesh ; but what were that to this sight of Christ in heaven ? we shall behold not a crucified body , but a glorified body . 

2.  To be with Christ , implies fruition ; we shall not only see him , but enjoy him : therefore in scripture the saints are said not only to behold him , but to be glorified with him , rom. 8. 17. and glory is said not only to be revealed to us , but in us , rom. 8. 18.  and enter thou into the joy of thy Lord , mat. 25. 21. not only see it , but enter into it . A man May see a fair arbour drawn upon the wall , but he cannot enter into it ; this glory of heaven May be entered into ; as the sponge sucks in the wine , so there shall be a libation and sucking in of glory ; from this fruition of Christ , a torrent of divine joy will flow into the soul . 

3.  To be with Christ , implies duration , 1 thes. 4. 17.  so shall we ever be with the Lord ; the {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , the fashion of the world passeth away , 1 cor. 7. 31.  Earthly comforts though they May be sweet , they are swift ; Plutarch reports of Alexander that he caused to be painted on a table a sword within a wheel : implying , that what he had gotten by his sword was subject to be turned about with the wheel of providence ; if we had the longest lease of these things , it would soon be run out ; but this privilege of being with Christ , runs parallel with eternity : so shall we be ever with the Lord . 

use 1.  See from hence the difference between a believers departing and a wicked man's departing ; to a believer it is an happy departing , to a wicked man , it is a sad departing , there 's nothing but departing ; he departs out of this life , and he departs from Christ , depart from me ye cursed ; he departs from beams of glory , into flames of fire ; he departs from the society of angels , into the fellowship of devils , mat. 25. 41.  he hath never done departing ; 't is mors sine morte , the wicked shall be ever consuming , yet never consumed ; they May tremble to think of departing , well May the mourners go about the street when a wicked man dyes ; hell May rightly be called bochim the place of weepers . * 

see how little cause a child of God hath to fear death , when it carries him to Christ . This is a deathbed cordial ; we are naturally possessed with a strange kind of palpitation and trembling at the thoughts of death , as if we were in a shaking palsy * , whereas there is nothing more really advantageous to a Christian ; death is a bridge that leads to the paradise of God ; all the hurt that death doth to a believer , is to carry him to Christ , and is not that far better ? death pulls off the rags of the body , and puts Christ's robes upon the soul . The serious consideration of this would make a believer above the desire of life , and the fear of death . 

object . but May a child of God say , i could rejoice at the gain of death , but i fear the pain of death . I desire the haven , but i tremble at the voyage . 

answ . 1.  in other cases we do not refuse pain ; there is pain in the setting of a bone , in the lancing of a sore , yet we endure the pain contentedly , because it is in ordine ad sanitatem , in order to a cure . Death is an healing thing , it will cure a Christian of all his wounds ; by making one issue , it cures all the rest . 

2.  Do we endure no pain at all in our life ? Job felt so many miseries , that he did choose rather to die than live , Job 7. 5.  & 15.  My flesh is clothed with worms , my skin is broken and become loathsome , so that my soul chooseth strangling and death , rather than life ; the life of man is a continual catastrophe and is interwoven with miseries : * some have felt more pain in their life , than others have at their death . 

3.  What are a few pangs of death , compared with the pangs of a guilty conscience , or with the flames of hell , which God hath freed a believer from ? How light is death ▪ compared with the weight of glory ? 1 cor. 4. 17. how short , in respect of eternity ? the present suffering is not worthy of the glory which shall be revealed in the children of God , rom. 8. 18.  

4.  We make death more than it is ; as the Moabites thought the waters had been blood , when they received only a colour and tincture from the sunbeams , 2 king. 3. 23. we fancy death worse than it is , we look upon it through a multiplying glass ; fear makes a Christian see double ; shut the eye of sense , and open the eye of faith , and death will appear less formidable . 

use 2.  Let us then put ourselves upon a scrutiny and trial whether we are persons that shall go to Christ when we die ? 't is certain we shall depart , but the question is whether shall we go to Christ ? 

quest . how May that be known ? 

answ. if we are in Christ while we live , we shall go to Christ , when we die ; union is the ground of privilege ; we must be in Christ , before we can be with Christ * ; many hope to go to Christ when they die , but they are not in Christ ; are they in Christ that do not know him ? are they in Christ that hate him in his ministers , in his ordinances ? oh labour to be in Christ . 

quest . how is that ? 

answ. by faith ; faith is the uniting grace , it is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} as Chrysostom speaks ; it is the vital , radical , Cardinal grace : this gives the interest . Faith is the Queen of the graces ; by faith we take Christ as a husband , and give up ourselves to him as a Lord ; faith is a Christ approptiating grace ; it hath both a relying and an applying faculty ; Christ is the ring , faith is the finger that puts on this ring ; faith opens the orifice in Christ's sides , and drinks in his blood * ; faith is both justifying and sanctifying ; it fetcheth blood out of Christ's sides to pardon , and water out of his sides to purge , 1 John 5. 6.  Oh with all getings get faith . 

quest . but there is much deceit about this grace ? The Cyprian diamond ( Saith Pliny ) looks like the true Indian diamond , but it is not of the right kind , it will break with the hammer . The devil hath his bad wares , and counterfeit graces to put off ; how therefore shall we know a true faith from a false and spurious ? 

answ. i shall give you two differencing notes . 

1.  True faith is ever found in an heart deeply humbled for sin , acts 2. 37.  {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , they were pricked at their hearts ; here was the first budding of faith ; you never saw a flower grow out of a stone , nor faith out of an heart of stone . Faith is an herb that grows always in a moist soil , in a weeping eye and a broken heart ; Mark 9 24.  The father of the child cried out with tears , Lord i believe . this flag of faith grows in the water . 

2.  True faith is operative ; the lapidaries say there is no precious stone but hath virtutem insitam , some virtue latent in it ; so we May say of precious faith ; it hath hidden virtue in it , 't is very operative , it works out sin , acts 15. 9  it works by love , gal. 5. 6. it is full of good works , James 2. 17. it makes the tongue speak for Christ , the head study , the hands work , the feet run in the ways of his commandments ; faith comes with power upon the heart , 2 thes. 1. 11.  The work of faith with power * , it hath a restraining and constraining power ; by this we May know whether ours be a true faith or no . I have read of a father who had three sons , and being to die , he left in his will all his estate to that son who could find his ring with the jewel which had a healing virtue ; the case was brought before the judges , the two elder sons counterfeited a ring , but the younger son brought the true ring , which was proved by the virtue of it , whereupon his father's estate went to him ; to this ring i May compare faith , there is a counterfeit faith in the world , but if we can find this ring of faith which hath the virtue in it , both purgative and operative , this is the true faith which doth interest us in and entitle us to Jesus Christ , and if we are in Christ while we live , we shall be with Christ when we die ; where faith gives a propriety , death gives a possession . 

use 3.  Here is then comfort in the death of our religious friends , * , though they depart from us , yet {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , they go to Christ which is far better ; we should mourn for them who are living , yet dead in sin ; and rejoice for them who are dead , yet live with Christ ; this our dear brother interred , had holy pangs of desire which seemed no less strong than the pangs of he panted after God as his ultimate and supreme perfection ; he did often with joy repeat the words of the text , and seemed to roll them as honey under his tongue ; we May therefore entertain good hopes of him that he is placed in that paradise of God which he thirsted after , i wished him to look up to the merits of Christ ; i must ( Saith he ) rest there or nowhere . Oh what a comfort is this to think that our friends are not only taken away from the evil to come * , but that they are with Christ ; why should we be sad at their preferment ? they have their crown , 2 tim. 4. 8. their throne , revel. 3. 21. their white robes , revel. 7. 9  why should we weep immoderately for them who have all tears wiped from their eyes ? they enter into the joy of their Lord ; and why should we be swallowed up of grief for them who are swallowed up of joy * ; they that die in the Lord , are not amissi , but praemissi * , they are not lost , but sent a little before , we shall shortly overtake them . 't is but awhile when godly friends shall meet in heaven , and feast together at the supper of the lamb , revel. 19 9  't is but a while when the saints shall lie together in Christ's bosom , that hive of sweetness , that bed of perfume . blessed are the dead that die in the Lord , revel. 14. 13.  Why should we mourn excessively for them who are blessed ? Oh let us not weep at the felicity of our friends , but rather long to depart and be with Christ , when we shall drink of those rivers of pleasure which run at his right hand for evermore . 

Finis . 

An elegy upon the much lamented death of his dear friend Mr. Stock . 

Muse's avaunt , i need you not t' inspire 
My duller veins with your poetic fire . 
Such an occasion as a doleful urn , 
Cannot but make even parrots poets turn ; 
And dumb-born children speak like Cro•sus son , 
To see their parents struck at ▪ every stone 
Can then turn vocal mourner , such an hearse ▪ 
Will make Tully himself to pour forth verse . 
Oh happy they who knew thee not , if there 
Be any such within our hemisphere ! 
It was blessed ignorance thee not to know , 
That kept them from the knowledge of their woe ; 
From direful fears , from griefs soul-piercing dart , 
From restless palpitations of the heart . 
Methinks i dare not represent thy worth , 
( How vast it was ) nor set thy praises forth . 
Friends , tell not Cambridge that her crown is gone , 
Nor London what great cause she hath to mourn . 
Wake not that lion , grief ; and give no vent 
To those fierce streams of raging discontent : 
Lest Jordan like , they quickly overflow 
Their banks , and drown us in this common woe . 
His parts so high , that if death had not shown 
Thy mortal state ; i had not feared to own 
Thee for some nobler creature ; and his fire 
Of zeal was such as glows in that best choir 
Of Seraphims ; there was both light and heat , 
And all that here below is wondered at : 
Was Plato's doctrine true , this was the man , 
The idea of a solid Christian ? 
When all the earth turned round , and wheeled about , 
Reeling now here , now there , ever in doubt , 
Drunk with opinions , he still like the sun , 
Stood firm and fixed in his station . 
His knowledge deep and large , yet never made 
Him dare the preathers office to invade . 
He never liked to go beyond his reach , 
Willing he was to learn , though apt to teach . 
I 'll add no more , for if i should display 
His matchless treasures , i should fright away 
Belief , and make doubtful posterity 
Conclude , i did not write an history 
Of what thou wast ; ( For who 'll believe one span 
Could grasp of worth so vast an ocean ? ) 
But feign a person in whose name to show 
What men should be , not what in thee was true . 
Mat. Pool . 

Upon the much to be lamented death of that hopeful gentleman , Mr. Jacob Stock , who died in the flower of his age , &c.  

Thus deaths devouring sith stays not for time , 
But cuts our choicest flowers down in their prime : 
with too much speed she antidates the day , 
And croppeth off our July flowers in May ; 
Yea , with an avaricious hand to mock 
Our future hopes , she robs us of our stock ; 
Not moved with sweetness , piety or parts , 
With dearest friends , with wives sad eyes and hearts ; 
As if the plants of such rare use and show , 
Might not in a terrestrial garden grow ; 
i' th' highest paradise she hath him set , 
Where the selectest nurseries of the earth are met . 
Where like transplanted stems , he now redoubles 
His breadth and sweetness , being grown rich by troubles . 
So we our losses shall complain no more ; 
We 've lost our stock , but he increased the store . 
And to that glorious place such beauty brings , 
As decks * the garland of the King of Kings . 
By a friend . 

The muse's threnody , and faith's epinicion ; or a funeral elegy upon the worthy of all memory , Mr. Jacob Stock . 

Fa .  — What! naught but weep , sad muse ? Up , dry thine eyes , 
Hang head no more , see how he winged flies 
Among the cherubs ; once i saw him dwell 
Within the microcosm of a shell : 
Now perched in heaven ; come , let 's up and look him , 
A fever hatched him , than the angels took him . 


Mu.   — Ah! I 'm undone , 
He was my Benjamin , my only son , 
Idolatry i would not recontrive , 
Or else I 'd call him Moses redivive 
For skill in Egypt's arts ; methinks i see 
Their hieroglicks in logometry . 
Great livye in small skins , or Philadelph 
The old world's wonder pi'ld up in a shelf . 
All euclids lines concentred in a point , 
And ptol'mys broken spheres right set in joint . 


Fa.   — Peace babbling muse , dost thou think such man 
Can grasped be within thy narrow span , 
Or fully measured with thy pigmy's feet , 
About whom the widest orbs could never meet ? 
His soul 's a pledge in Goshen , spare your groans , 
Joseph will shortly send for Jacob's bones . 


C. c.  

Upon the death of my worthy friend Mr. Jacob Stock . 

He only knows , who knows how thou didst live , 
How much for loss of thee 't is fit to grieve ; 
And yet our tears would fail us if we were 
To every virtue bound to pay a tear ; 
For all those virtues which dispersed shine 
In several lives , unite their beams in thine ; 
Thou wast not only kind or liberal , 
Modest or just , or temperate , but all ; 
And among all religion did sway , 
As the first sphere turns all the orbs one way . 
Ah! why so soon snatched hence ! 't is true by noon 
Thy early virtue all its work had done ; 
but yet thou shouldst have lived more leisurely , 
That we Might have observed and followed thee ; 
Not penned thy life up in so narrow space , 
Where whilst each virtue striving for a place , 
Crowds to get in before it be too late , 
Thou livest too fast for us to imitate . 
Since then much of thy life is lost , we 'll try 
Some nobler thing , to live as thou didst die .
