THE PREFACE . 

THE Light of the Day of GOD Almighty , is arisen upon us in our day ; and the shinings forth thereof , is with great clearness and force , even as the Sun at noonday , and many are come to the glorious Appearance thereof , and to walk in its Light with much joyfulness : for , as the Wise man said , The Light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the Eye to behold the Sun : And so fully is our Morning-sun now appeared , that the Upright in heart may walk and not stumble , and the poor in spirit may run in the path of Life , and not fall ; for , indeed we may say the Night is spent , and the Day is come ; therefore let us walk in the Day , and put on the Armour of Light , as many as are made the Children thereof . 

And where the Light of this Sun is arisen , and in whose hearts it shines , it cannot but give some Testimony through such an one , of its own Glory , Virtues and Excellency , to them that sit yet in darkness and in the bondage of Corruption , that they also may see the same Light and Glory arise on their Tabernacle : for 't is the property of this spiritual heavenly Light , to shine forth out of darkness , and to give light to such as have long sat in darkness , that their souls may live , and be refreshed with the Light of the Living ; And for this cause do we labour and spend , and are spent , accounting nothing too dear for us , that the Light of Truth may shine abroad and guide the Upright in the perfect way , till the Elect be gathered into the pasture of Eternal Life , and the Sun so elevated on the Firmament of joy and Praises , never to go down , but the saying fulfilled , There shall be no night , but the light of the Sun shall be as the light of seven days . 

These following Testimonies were written at diverse times , as the Lord drew forth my spirit through the motions of his Life in me ; some of them , some years since ; and being cast by among bundles of Manuscripts , and now lately come to my sight , and looking them over , I have thought good to send them abroad , as being of service to many : And this is the Occasion and End of my present publishing these things . And to the judgement of the Spirit of God in all the Saints , do I commend my Labours , and may self to be approved ; 

Who am a Friend to all men . E. B.  Westmoreland , the 25th of the 7th Month , 1661.  

CHAP. I  

A TESTIMONY concerning LIFE AND DEATH , with their several Fruits and Effects distinguished . 

There is only Life and Death , and there is but only Life and Death in the whole Creation , that ruleth and reigneth , in , and among , and over all the Children of men ; and all the Children of men upon the face of the Hearth are under the Government and Dominion of Life , or of Death , in whatsoever they are , and in whatsoever they do ; and Life or Death hath the Rule and Government in every Creature , in every Exercise , whether of Works or Words ; and all People upon the Earth are subject to the Government of one , or the other , and bring forth the Fruits and Works in obedience to Life or to Death , and shows them forth in visible appearance . Now these two , ( to wit ) Life and Death , are contrary one to the other , in being , in nature , in works and fruits ; and each of these are known and distinguished the one from the other , in being , in nature , in fruits and effects , which diversely they bring forth in this World ; and each of them hath a Kingdom and Government in himself , distinct from , and contrary each to other ; and each of them have their several Subjects , which also are contrary in birth and generation , in quality and kind ; over which they rule and govern , and to whom they give distinct Portions and Heirships in this World , and hereafter : And where Life rules and reigns , Death is held in captivity and bondage ; and where Death life's , the Life dies ; and where one of these brings forth fruit , the other is barren ; for they agree not in one , but are in all things contrary : and the Subjects of the one are always opposing and striving against the Subjects of the other : And between Life and Death there is continual war and strife among the Creatures , who are the Subjects of the one of them , in whatsoever man is , and in what he doth . 

First , concerning Life I will speak . Life was in the beginning with God , and is without descent , and God is Life in himself , without beginning or ending of time , place , or matter ; and Life put forth itself out of its invisible being , into work and action in the beginning of the World , and appeared in visible operations and works , and brought forth all Creatures , and all things , into visible appearances ; and Life was the Author of all , the Beginning and Foundation of all ; and Life was and is that Being and Virtue of all things that are , and it was the joy and Delight of all things that itself brought forth ; for all 〈…〉 through it , and it gave breath and 〈…〉 all Creatures ; and Life blessed them all , and in it were all Creatures at Unity , being framed and brought into visibility , and for the pleasure of Life , which was all in all in the beginning ; and there was a sweet concurrence and harmony in the whole Creation through the power and being of Life in the midst of all Creatures , through which the whole Creation was made and framed by the Eternal Word of Life , and through which they stood and did remain in blessedness ; and Life ruled and reigned in every Creature that was brought forth , and was the glory and substance thereof : for Life was and is that only begotten of the Father , the Son and the Heir of the Everlasting Father , his express Image and Brightness ; being one with the Father , not separated or divided from him . 

And as for Death , it was not yet known , nor had it any place in the Creation ; if had yet received no Power , nor Kingdom , nor Government , neither was it in being : But Life was all , over all , through all , and in all , in the beginning , before disobedience and transgression entered to war against Life ; But Life was Prince , Ruler and Governor , in and over all the works of the Creator . And Life in its Being is God , and God is Life ; and in its Government , and Fruits , and Effects , is Purity , Righteousness , Truth , Holiness , Meekness , and all the works that are just and equal according to God , and like Him , and which shows him forth in the Creation ; and this was , and it was thus in the beginning , before Death entered into the World , or had a Kingdom ; But it is written , the Devil abode not in the Truth , but went out of the Truth ; and he is the king of Death , and hath the power of it ; he went out of the Power of God , and out of the Life , by which all things was made and created , and abode not in the Truth , nor in the Life , to live , and act , and speak in that , but desired to be , and became to be something of himself without God ; and he spoke of himself , and acted of himself , without the Power and Life , and also contrary to the Power and Life of the Creator , being separated from it , and become a distinct being of himself ; and then having lost his state and first condition , thus became an Enemy to Life and Truth , and became the King of Death ; and he was the first of Death's race , and he holds the Power of it upon this day ; he being gone out of the Truth , and out of the Power and Life of God , and become a distinct being of himself , having a Kingdom of his own to promote in opposition to the Kingdom of God. then he drew mankind out of the Power and Truth , and Life ; beguiled Eve and Adam , as you read in the Scriptures , and they lost the Life & Power ( even all feeling of it , and comfort in it ) by which they were created and made ; and they also transgressed and acted contrary to the Life and Power , and acted of themselves , and spoke of themselves , without the Power and Life of their Creator , being separated from it ; and were and did something of themselves without God the Creator : and then the Power and Life cast them out of all Peace , Joy , and Happiness , into the Earth , and into Death ; and Death became King and Prince over mankind : And they had no more possession of Life , nor blessedness by it in their separated estate , neither did it any longer reign in them ; but they having transgressed against the Life , and acted of themselves , and spoken of themselves , without the leading and move of the Life , this was their transgression ; They went out of the Power and Life in all motions and actions , and them Life driven them forth of its Good Pleasure into the Earth , separate from its virtues and peace , and into Death , which is contrary to itself , to live in anguish and sorrow : and so when the Devil was gone out of the Truth , and had led Mankind out of the Truth , and out of Life , and thereby they were all separated from Life , and driven out from God , out of his pleasure , into his wrath ; then became Death to have a being in Mankind , and great authority , and not before ; and then Death began his Kingdom in the World , and over it , and he set up his Rule and Government in , and among , and over all the Children of men . 

And so from Transgression came Death , that was its beginning , Man having transgressed against the Life that brought him forth ; and being separated from Life , than Death took place , and its Kingdom was established over the World , and in all the Children of men , in opposition to Life , and its Government and Kingdom ; and Death reigns , from Adam , so saith the Scripture ▪ and the Life was transgressed against , and so provoked into an absence , and to withdraw itself into invisibility from the enjoyment of Mankind , that it should not be self nor perceived of Him to comfort him ; and then the whole body of Death came upon Man , to lead his Conscience and vex his Soul : and Death , and only Death hath a Pre-eminence over all in Transgression , and is established into a Kingdom , over sinful Subjects , who are under its Command ; and hath its Rule and Government , and brings forth its Works and Fruits in Mankind , contrary to Life , and in opposition to it , and to its Kingdom and Power , and opposeth the Kingdom and Power of Life ( the Creator ; ) and in its Nature , and all its Fruits and Works , it is contrary and opposite to Life , and its Works and Fruits ; and through Death is the whole Creation in its exercise by Man perverted from the right use and end ordained of God ; and out of Death proceedeth all Evil , as Lying , Swearing , Drunkenness and Whoredom , Pride , Strife , and every evil work and word : These things are the Fruits and Works of Death ; and Death governs the Children of men in the practice of all these things ; and in transgression Death life's , and acts , and speaks through Men and Women ; and Death rules in them , and hath perverted them in all their ways ; for they have given their Power to it , and it wholly captivates them , and is established over them , and hath the dominion in them , and Life is swallowed up of it : And this Kingdom of Death opposeth God , and the Kingdom of Life , and exalts itself against Life , and hath its operation in the Creature , in all manner of unrighteousness , bringing forth daily such words , works , fruits and effects , as doth oppress and is a burden unto the Life , and unto the God of Life and Death ; and its Kingdom doth continually war and strive against Life and its Kingdom , and the one opposeth the other through all Generations since the beginning : for the Devil is the King of Death , and hath the power of it , and he is King in its Government , and Ruler in its Dominion ; and this is the state of all the Children of men in Transgression , Death rules , and the kingdom of Death reigns in them , and it brings forth cursed fruits through them , and they are subjects thereof , and in obedience thereunto in all things : And through Death , which hath power over them , are they separated from Life , and have no part nor portion therein , because of Death , that hath separated them , and veiled and clouded them , and loads their Consciences . 

But now the Promise of the God of Life , is , to restore Mankind out of Death and Darkness , and that Life shall reign again , and subdue Death , and destroy it and its Kingdom , and swallow it up ; and this is the Promise of the Father : For , in transgression Death hath subdued Life , and overcome it in Mankind ; But in the Restoration , Life shall swallow up Death , and subdue it , and overcome it : and this comes to pass through the rising again of Life from under Death , which hath held it in bondage ; and Life that made the World in the beginning , and gave to all things life and substance , as I have said ; which Life , in its measure in Mankind , hath been overcome and swallowed up in Transgression : That Life shall appear , though in another manner of appearance than it did in the beginning ; for than it appeared freely of itself without opposition , and brought forth the first Creation ; But now it doth appear through great opposition , and through all that doth oppose it in this second Creation , when Life comes again to reign over Death , and swallow it up , and overcome and subdue it ; and who comes to witness this ( the new Creation ) they know Life appearing through opposition , and through the destroying of Death , and all its works and fruits : for CHRIST is the Life , and he is the Seed of the Woman , which bruiseth the Serpent's head , who hath the power of Death ; Life bruiseth his Head , breaketh his Government , and destroys his Works , as it appeareth and riseth in the Creature ; and Death and its works opposeth Life and its manifestation and appearance , and gainsays it , and often quencheth it in its appearances . 

Now the first appearance of Life in the Creature , it convinceth and reproveth the works of Death , and the words that proceed from Death , which are unrighteous words , and unrighteous works ; and Life when it rises , reproves them and condemns them : and through Death doth oppose and gainsay the Operation of 〈◊〉 ; yet Life works through , and overcometh , subdueth , and swalloweth up Death , and destroys all its works in the second Creation : and Life again comes to take possession of the Creature , which it made in the beginning ; and Life comes to reign again , 〈◊〉 Right it is to reign ; for , by it the Creature Mankind , and all Creatures were in the beginning form and brought forth , and therefore it is its Right to reign , and to have the dominion over the works of its 〈◊〉 is , whom since the beginning in Transgression , the Devil and Death , and his seat of Government ▪ hath had they possession of : and CHRIST the Power of God , and the Life , hath been as it were dispossessed : and thus the first Creation has been defaced , and lost its Glory ; and it hath been corrupted and degenerated quite from the perfect state as it was created in , and Mankind hath been servant to another Power , and led captive by another Power than the Power that made him , and another Government hath been established over him , and another Law hath exercised him than the Government and Law of the Creator , ( to wit ) the Power and Government , and Law of Death have had the Rule , Government and Exercise of man , and of the old Creation , and hereby all things have been diverted from their proper and perfect place and service , to which they were ordained in the beginning , by reason . Transgression and the reigning of Death ; and Man 〈◊〉 been held in Captivity , and in sore Bondage , and 〈…〉 all 〈◊〉 and distress , deprived of unity with his 〈◊〉 , and deprived of the comfortable use and benefit of the Creation ; 〈◊〉 that of all Creatures he hath been the most 〈◊〉 , being held in Bondage and Captivity under the 〈…〉 , which hath ruled and reigned over him , and in 〈…〉 always subject to Death , and subject to the Curse and Anger of the LORD ▪ and subject to 〈◊〉 and fears , 〈…〉 and sorrow ; and all this is , because Death hath reigned and had dominion ; even that which 〈…〉 in the beginning of Transgression , betrayed him of the 〈…〉 , that got possession itself to reign , and to have the Power , which ever since hath reigned , and always doth , till the appearance of the Life again , which doth appear in the Creature for this end , to overcome and subdue Death , and destroy his works , that itself may reign and free the Creation from its degeneration and corruption , and free Mankind from his bondage and captivity , and from his misery and all his trouble , which is come upon him by reason of Death . 

And this comes to pass in the New-creation when Life is born again , to rule and reign again , and to swallow up Death , and to subdue it wholly , and its Kingdom and Government . And then Man again is become a Son of GOD , an Heir of Salvation , and no more Death reigns in him , nor hath power over him , when he is restored out of Transgression ; then , as Death hath reigned and had power in Transgression , Life shall so reign in and over the Creature , in the New-creation , when that is brought forth , as Death hath reigned in the Old-creation in Transgression and Disobedience : And Life will arise to reign and rule over all , and in all , though it be through great opposition ; the Body of Death shall be put off , and the Government of Death shall be subdued , and all the Works , Fruits and Effects of Death shall be destroyed and done away , and its place shall no more be found , so as to bring forth Fruit ; for its sting shall be taken away , and shall no more wound , nor pierce , nor hurt the Creature : For the sting of Death is Sin , and that hath wounded and hurt the Creature ; and when this comes to pass , then there is glory and rejoicing over all , for Life hath swallowed up Death , and overcome it , and the cause of Sorrow is removed and taken away , and the Kingdom of Life is established in the Creature , and is set upon the Top of Death's Kingdom , and keeps it under , and if there be but a motion of Death that would spring up , or appear in the Creature , Life judgeth it down , and condemns it . And this Kingdom , is Righteousness , joy , and Peace , full of justice , Righteousness and Equity , and there is nothing in it that doth defile or destry , or bring sorrow or misery ; but Life rules over all that , and subdues the Cause thereof , and removes every thing that would embodage or captivated the Creature in evil : And this Kingdom is not of this World , but from Heaven and heavenly ; and the Birth immortal is Heir thereof , which receives the Crown and the Kingdom of Eternal Life . 

Now the Kingdom of Death is of this World , which is defiled and degenerated : Cain was a Subject of this Kingdom , and Esau that was a Reprobate , and judas that betrayed the Life , and all the Ungodly and Generation of the Wicked since the beginning , they were all of the Kingdom of Death , and the Kingdom of Death ruled in them , and brought forth its works through them , and its exercise in their hearts and in their lives ; And though its power they opposed and gainsayed the Life , and they fought against the Kingdom of Life and Righteousness , and such were the Pharisces who put Christ to death , who is the Life . Death reigned over all these , and they were of the Stock of Death , and they were of this World , and had their Conversation below in the earthly things ; and knew not the Life , not its Government , but were strangers to it , and enemies to it , as all are at this day , who are transgressors against the Life , and all such are subject to the Curse , to Sorrow and Misery , and the Anger of the LORD ; but who comes to feel the Life , and the obedience to it again , Death is destroyed through Death ; for , through the death of Death , Death comes to be destroyed , and no otherway : which the Life works , and the Life works through Death , and overcomes it , and swallows it up ; and this is the second Creation , and the new Creation , where Life reigns over all , and doth possess the Creature , as it did before Transgression . The Life is the Light , and the Life is the Law , and Life life's , moves , and acts the Creature ; and CHRIST who is the Life , becomes all in all ; and blessed are they who wait for this , and do witness it : to such am I known in these things , where the Kingdom of Death is overcome and swallowed up of Life . 

CHAP. II  

A Testimony concerning the Mystery of GOD and Godliness ; and , concerning the Mystery of the Devil and Iniquity . 

There are two great Mysteries in their invisible being , and in manifestation to us in the world , ( that is to say ) the Mystery of GOD and Godliness , and the Mystery of the Devil and Iniquity . These are two great Mysteries , which do discover and act themselves forth in , and among , and through the children of men in this Creation ; and these two Mysteries are contrary one to the other , in being , in nature , in works , in fruits and effects ; and they are in strife one against the other , the one continually opposing the other , and striving for the Creature , Mankind , to be the Instrument to display themselves through , in visible appearance ; for the Creature Man and Woman is a Vessel wherein these Mysteries are contained , and whereby these Mysteries do show themselves forth in the world ; and all the sons of Adam upon the face of the Earth are possessed with , and of , one of these , ( that is to say ) The Mystery of GOD , or the Mystery of the Devil do manifest themselves forth through every Man and Woman ; and through all the sons of Adam upon the face of the Earth , the works , fruits and effects of one of these are brought forth . 

And as for the Mystery of GOD , it is infinite and eternal in being , and which was , and is , and is to come , without beginning or end : and this Mystery reaches itself forth more or lesle in every creature upon the face of the whole Earth , and is the Life , and Being , and Substance of all Things ; and all Creatures upon the face of the Earth , whether movable or immovable , is a partaker of this Mystery ; and this Mystery is veiled and hidden secretly in and under all things that have a being , and whatsoever the Creature brought forth , even in the greatest appearance thereof ; and its goodness and virtue , in what form or appearance soever , is but the production , or the manifestation of the Mystery [ GOD ] for the life of every Creature , and the virtue of every Creature is a Mystery , and proceedeth out of the great Mystery of GOD , who is Life itself , Virtue itself , 〈…〉 itself , and Being itself ; and is the Goodness , and the Virtue , and the Life and Being of all Things and Creatures upon the 〈◊〉 of the Earth ; 〈…〉 every thing that hath a being , even the Wicked and 〈◊〉 , are not without this Mystery 〈…〉 manner 〈◊〉 other ; for by Him every Creature is , an 〈◊〉 first being . 

But now more perfectly doth the Mystery of GOD appear in his Servants , and in his Children who are born of Him , and begotten by Him , and they have the sense and feeling , and understanding of this Mystery more than any other Creatures ; and this is their Glory and Crown above all other Creatures upon the face of the whole Earth ; for they only , I say , who are redeemed to God , and born of the Spirit , they are them that have the sense , and feeling , and understanding of this Mystery , even of the Mystery of GOD , infinite , endless and eternal . And though this Mystery be hid in all other Creatures , and manifesting itself through them , yet this Mystery is not known to them , nor understood of them , nor of any other Creature ( I say ) besides the Children of the Lord , in whom this Mystery is only revealed ; for they are them through whom more manifestly and plainly this Mystery is made manifest , and to them revealed , and known , and felt in their Understandings ; and they have the enjoyment thereof who know God , and are known of him , and are entered into Covenant with him , into Everlasting Covenant of joy and Peace ; and through them doth this Mystery display itself , even in the sight of all Creatures , in works of Righteousness , and works of Purity , and works of Goodness , of Mercy , of Truth , of Peace , and of Wisdom , in their exercise of all things ; and in this manner , and by these fruits and effects doth the Mystery of GOD show itself forth through his Children , in whom the Mystery is opened , that is hid in all other Creatures : And this is the Crown of the Children of the Lord , that are born from Heaven , and from above , that the Mystery of GOD is felt and enjoyed by them , and more manifest to them than in any other Creatures : And to know this Mystery of GOD , is Life Eternal ; and to have the understanding of his Leading , of his Judgement , of his Mercy , and of his Counsel , and of the operation of his Power ; to feel this in the Understanding , this is joy , and a Crown of Glory , where the Mystery of GOD is revealed in Spirit . 

And as for the Mystery of the Devil , it is darkness , and in darkness ; and it shows itself forth in the Ungodly , and in the sons of Adam in transgression , and in such only doth this Mystery of Iniquity , and of Sin , and of the Devil display itself forth in all unrighteousness and sin ; and that which is contrary to the Creator in works , words and thoughts ; All these things are the manifestation of the Mystery of the Devil , and its fruits and effects , who is out of the Truth , who is veiled and covered , and hidden in the hearts of the Ungodly , and in the hearts of the sons of Adam in the Fall : This Mystery was not from the beginning , as the other , but when the Devil went out of the Truth , and had led Man's mind out of the Truth , and taken possession of the heart of Man , and become ruler and lord there , having gained authority over Man through Man's obedience to him , than began this Mystery to discover itself , and act itself through the Creature ; and this was since the beginning : And though no other creature be an Agent to manifest forth this Mystery but Man , yet Man in his exercise of all Creatures , or all Creatures through the exercise of Man in transgression , there is showed forth this Mystery of Iniquity , that secretly lurks in the spirits of ungodly men ; which spirit of unrighteousness , the Mystery of the Devil , leads Man into all sinfulness , of drunkenness and uncleanness , and such like , and hath polluted the Earth , and defiled all Creatures through Man's exercise in them : and this is truly an appearance of the Mystery of the Devil ; yet he hath other appearances , and other makings-out of his Mystery ( to wit ) in a way of seeming Righteousness , and seeming Holiness , and seeming Purity ; and these show the Mystery of Unrighteousness , the Mystery of the Devil , who deceives the soul that is immortal of the enjoyment of the Creator , who is the desire of the Immortal Soul ; and so through a form , and likeness , and appearance of a thing is the Soul Immortal deceived , and beguiled with that which hath appearances in it , but no life nor substance . 

And though the Mystery of Iniquity be but one in itself , yet it manifests itself diverse ways ; sometimes in open profaneness and wickedness , and sometime in seeming righteousness and holiness , and in a form of Religion without power : But the Lord is arisen to confound the Mystery of the Devil and Iniquity , and will discover it , and destroy it ; for it is the Mystery of Iniquity that worketh in the Children of Disobedience , that are strangers to God ; and through the operation of this Mystery are people kept at a distance from the Lord , and out of Unity and Covenant with Him : and this Mystery of Iniquity worketh hiddenly , not known but in the Eternal Eye , which sees through the spirit of Creatures , and comprehendeth and fathometh over the nature of things , and can judge beyond the appearance , even in the ground , before action appeareth : for while people are professing and acting Holiness and Righteousness visibly , and yet not changed by the Power of the Lord , nor renewed in nature , mind , and spirit , from the first Adam to the second , the Righteousness and Holiness brought forth in that state , is but the acting of the Mystery of Iniquity , and the Wolf putting on the Sheep's clothing ; And this God will judge , and all appearances without life , and all shows without substance , All this will the Lord judge and confound , and bring to naught ; for it is but the working of the Mystery of the Devil , who is out of the Truth . 

And this Mystery hath more abounded since the days of the Apostles , than in Ages since the beginning , in as much as this Mystery hath operated and displayed itself forth in a higher appearance and fairer show than ever it did before ; for this Mystery hath sat in the Temple of God , and showed itself to be God , and been worshipped above all that is called God : This Mystery of Iniquity , the Man of Sin , which hath put on the Sheep's clothing , and shows itself as the Sheep of Christ , and as Christians and Churches ; all which hath been for many Ages the manifestation of this Mystery , while that the Mystery of the Devil hath not been destroyed : but now is the Lord arisen , who will discover and destroy this Mystery , and save the Creature ; and in the destruction of this Mystery , is the other Mystery revealed , ( to wit ) The Mystery of God and of Christ , and that is the Mystery of Christ , that destroys the Mystery of Antichrist and of the Devil : And now the Sons and Daughters of the Lord Almighty are coming into this Mystery of God Eternal , who is blessed for ever ; and all that is coming to be overthrown which doth oppose it , and gainsay it ; and there is nothing that can destroy or discover this Mystery , but the appearance of Christ the Son of God ; for it is he that doth discover and destroy the Mystery of Iniquity , by the Spirit of his Mouth , and by the Brightness of his Coming ; and this are people coming to : The Man of Sin is to be thrown down , and the Man of Righteousness , the Man of God is revealed , and Sons and Daughters shall show him forth in the World , and the Mystery of God shall show itself forth over the World , and in Nations ; and blessed are all they that come to the opening of this Mystery of God , which is the Mystery of Life and Eternal Salvation . 

CHAP. III  

A Testimony concerning true Liberty of Conscience , what it is in itself , and how it is obtained ; and what the true Guide and Rule is of the Exercise of Conscience . 

This is my Testimony , as I have received from the Lord : True Liberty of Conscience , is , Liberty and Freedom of the Conscience from the bondage of Sin , and all Transgression past and present ; and from whatsoever hath been , or is a Burden or Oppression upon the Conscience , whether inward or outward : the Conscience , I say , is at liberty when it is freed from the burden of the guilt of Sin past , and from the present temptation unto Sin : And till this is witnessed , there is no true Liberty of Conscience ; For every thing whatsoever , which is Sin and Transgression against God , in works or words , brought forth by the Creature , is bondage and a burden , and oppresseth the pure Conscience : and therefore perfect freedom from all Sin and Transgression , is , where the body of Sin and Death is put off , and where the Evil is crucified , and the guilt of it taken away , and where the Conscience is truly exercised by the Spirit of Christ , which leads into all Truth , and preserveth from all Evil ; then is the Conscience at liberty , and this is true Liberty of Conscience , when this is brought forth in the Creature : For where Sin is brought forth , and Transgression lived in , there the Conscience is bound , and the Cord of Iniquity imbondageth the Conscience , and it hath not its liberty in the Service of God , nor from the service of the Devil , because the Spirit of God doth not exercise it ; but the spirit of unrighteousness leads the mind into the lusts of this world , into Lying , Swearing , Pride , Drunkenness , Hypocrisy , and Idolatry ; and the guilt of these things burdeneth and presseth down , and is a bondage upon the Conscience : and where the Conscience is bound by unrighteousness within , and by the spirit of the world , which leads contrary to the Lord , there is no power of man without can set that Conscience free , or give liberty to it ; because the Cord of Iniquity hath bound it within , and the burden of guilt is upon it , and Conscience lies under bondage , unexercised with the Spirit of God , which is free , and setteth free the Conscience in the practice of all Good , and from the power and captivity of all Evil.  

Therefore , before true Liberty of Conscience be witnessed , or any have true Liberty in Conscience , Iniquity must be purged out , and Sin crucified , and the body of Death put off , and Gild washed away , and the Anointing received that leads into all Truth , and the Blood of Christ ( the Seed ) felt , that sprinkleth the Conscience from all sin , and works of the flesh , and washeth away all that which stains and defileth the Conscience , and then the pure Conscience hath its true liberty from the bondage of all Evil , and from the guilt thereof , and in the exercise of all Good ; and this is true Liberty of Conscience ; and thus it is attained , and by no other way nor means , than by the sword of the Spirit of God , which cutteth down the contrary : and where Conscience is thus freed within by the Power of the Lord , and delivered from the bondage of Evil , and from the burden of all guilt , and exercised in all good by the Spirit of God ; then nothing without , nor any Power of Man , which may work against such by Persecution , and act in opposition to such whose Consciences are thus freed , can embodage the Conscience to God-wards , or bring it under a burden to Godwards , I say : for it is not altogether bondage of Conscience , or the burden or oppression upon his Conscience , that is set free , as aforesaid , though he is outwardly persecuted by Men ; for that doth but hinder the exercise of his Conscience to manwards , but not to Godwards ; for there his Conscience is free , in Joy and Peace , though , by reason of Persecution , he cannot have the exercise of it to men : I say , though such be put in Prison , banished , or whatsoever suffering be laid upon them , by any men , or Laws without ; yet their pure Conscience is free and at liberty in itself to Godwards , through all this , and over it all ; for he Lord hath set them free from all that bondage and guilt of Iniquity , which hath been a bondage upon their Consciences within : and whether they do suffer , or have freedom or captivity in their persons from men , yet is their pure Conscience at liberty to Godward , and in perfect freedom in itself , and to themselves , though for the Name of Christ , and his Truth , they be persecuted , and all evil done against them by evil men , and the exercise of their pure Consciences prevented , as to manwards . 

For that which defiles the Conscience , doth bring it under bondage ; but that which keeps it pure , and free from pollution , that keeps it in liberty , and in perfect freedom to God , over all Persecution and evil men , and unjust Laws , which would exercise dominion in and over the Conscience of the Saints , and bring them into captivity ; as sometimes their persons are by evil Laws and Persecutors . 

But who standeth in the Power of the Lord , and in the exercise of the Spirit of God , which freeth the Conscience in their own particulars ( as I have said ) doth not come into bondage in Conscience to Godwards , by Laws , or Men , but enjoyeth freedom and liberty therein ; as much in Sufferings and in Persecutions under all the Cruelty of men , as in doing and practices when they are not persecuted ; for in Sufferings the Conscience is exercised , and hath its liberty in patience and forbearance ; And at liberty of persons , in practice it is exercised , and hath its Liberty , in doing and performing whatsoever the Spirit of the Father moveth and leads unto . And thus , where God hath freed the Conscience , and it is free , and at liberty in Him , and to Him ; nothing without can bring it into bondage or captivity ; but in all conditions , and in all exercises , whether doing or suffering , the pure Conscience is in liberty in itself , and in perfect freedom in God , through all , over all , and beyond all . 

But now , there hath been a great Cry among many ( that have professed Righteousness and Religion ) for Freedom of Conscience , and begging and craving from the Powers of the Earth to tolerate Liberty of Conscience , and that they might have the Liberty of their Conscience in Religion : and thus some have been looking too much without for Liberty of Conscience from Men , and from Powers without them , before their Consciences were set free by the Lord within , and the bond of Iniquity broken , and that burden of Iniquity and Gild done away , which hath been a burden and bondage upon the Conscience : For , as I said , no Man , nor Powers of the Earth can truly free or give liberty to the Conscience , which is bound by the Cord of Iniquity within ; But 't is evident , the cry for Liberty hath not been so much for the Exercise of Conscience truly so , as for the Freedom each one of their Sect , and for the Liberty in practice of their own Worship and Conformity ; and thereupon have diverse men , of diverse Sects , sought to the Powers of Men , and of the Earth , to grant them Liberty of their Consciences ; when as it hath been rather , for the freedom to , and defence of , their Sect , and of their practices in their Worship , than for Liberty of Conscience truly so ; for while they have cried for Liberty from without , yet Sin , and Iniquity , and Transgression have lain upon their Conscience within , and they have sought from Men for the Liberty of their Sect , to practise their own Worship , which they have called Liberty of Conscience : And to this intent by some hath been the Cry for Liberty of Conscience , that their Sect , and their own Ways of Worship , might be defended from the violence of others , who have opposed their Practices and Worships : for people of diverse ways of Worship , and of diverse Sects , have all been at strife one with another , and divided one against another ; and yet all professed good Conscience , and cried for Liberty thereof from the Powers of the Earth ; not but that the Powers of the Earth ought to grant free Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of every Sect of Religion , and to suffer all to profess and practise their Religion , while they walk justly and peaceably in a Land : But here hath lodged the deceit and deceivableness of the spirit of Satan , in the hearts of men , from the least to the greatest of all those diverse false Sects and Worshippers ; they have therein zealously gone on , and pleaded for their Sects and Worship , though never so gross or dark , and contrary to Truth , under the denomination of Freedom and Liberty of good Conscience ; and the very Title and Name hath been the Colour , and deceived many , while a false Worship , and false Practices of false Sects , have gone under the name of Liberty of good Conscience ; and thousands have been deceived , and blindly led into such a false Sect , and into such a Profession , to act and perform with great Zeal , false Practices in a false Worship , falsely supposing it to be out of a good Conscience , and that they have acted in the liberty thereof : yea , and many may suffer great and grievous things , and some the loss of their Lives , for the very practice of false things , and false Worships , in a false Sect , and yet under the name of good Conscience , and for Liberty of Conscience , as they may profess and believe . 

But this may seem strange to be spoken to some , who may inquire how it comes to pass , and how this may be , that many may suffer great and grievous Cruelties ; and some the loss of their Lives , for the practice of false things , and the exercise of false Worships , which they may suppose to be out of a good Conscience , and for good Conscience sake ; whereas it is not truly so , nor rightly so : But how happeneth this , may some say ? 

I answer . This cometh to pass after this manner : Because Conscience is made of that , and of the things and performances which God requires not ; and so there is a great zeal in the doing and performing of such a Practice , and such a Worship , when as the Lord hath not required these things at their hands ; and this is , because the Mind , and Heart , and Conscience is dark , and not truly informed , nor guided with the Spirit of Truth , and of the Father ; but a false Spirit ruleth and leads the Conscience , and it is not exercised with the Spirit of the Father that leads into all Truth : So I do acknowledge that Conscience may be misled , and misguided , and misinformed ; and Conscience may be made of doing such and such things which the Lord doth not require , and there may be a fear not taught of the Lord , not received by the sense of his Presence , but only received into the heart by the Precepts of men , Example of others , Custom of times , or the like ; and here the Conscience being not truly informed , nor guided by the Spirit of the Lord , there is a false fear and zealousness in the performing of such things which the Lord doth not require , nor his Spirit lead into the practice of ; but only the Tradition and Precepts of men , hath placed a false Law and Commandment , which requires a false obedience ; which many , whose understandings are blinded , and being without true knowledge , they zealously perform and practise as the Worship of God , thinking themselves bound in Conscience to practise such things , and not to leave them undone ; when as the Lord , and his righteous Spirit leads not to them , nor yet his just Law doth require the doing thereof ; but only a false Law and Commandment is received by Precepts and Traditions of men , or from looking upon the Practice of others : By such means as this , there is a false fear in a blind misguided Conscience , and a zeal without true knowledge . 

And thus it was amongst the jews in the Prophet's days , they sacrificed their Children , and cut themselves , and caused their Children to pass through the fire , and did many things zealously ; when as saith the Lord , Who hath required these things at your hands ? for they come not into my heart . And Paul witnesseth the same of the jews in his days , and bore them record , that they had a Zeal , but it was not according to True Knowledge . And thus the jews were zealously performing that , as their Duty , and as out of a good Conscience , which the Lord required not at their hands ; and so they made Conscience to do that , which the Lord required not , and their Consciences were misled , and not rightly informed ; and , as it was amongst the jews in this case in the days of old , so now is it amongst the Christians in the Apostasy , their Conscience being misguided by a false spirit , they are doing and performing the things in great Zeal , and for the exercise of their Consciences , which the Lord doth not require of them : Thus do the Papists ; they do and practise the things in great Zeal , and through a false Fear in their blind Consciences , which things are in themselves Idolatry , and not commanded nor required 〈◊〉 the Lord ; as in many particulars I might show , even in many parts of their Worship and Religion , which out of a Fear , and blind Zeal , and misguided Conscience , they practise ; which is in itself but Idolatry , and not required nor accepted of the Lord And many things in relation to the protestants Worship , and amongst all the several false Sects upon Earth ; which are done and practised in great Zeal , and out of a false Fear , and as in pretence of a good Conscience , and yet are things in themselves Idolatrous , as done and practised by them : And this comes to pass , as I have said , because the Conscience is misinformed , and a false spirit guide's and rules in the exercise of Conscience , and the understanding of the People is blinded , and they know not but they do well , though their minds are captivated , and their minds and judgements in error ; and though there be a sincerity to Godwards , and a desire of Him in the bottom , among some People of all Forms and Sects , and some of all are zealous towards God in their practices , in their Religion and Worships ; yet among all People , and the Churches that have been for many Generations , there hath been great Error in judgement , and much blindness in mind , and the Conscience falsely exercised towards God , and the Superscription hath been , To the Unknown God ; and He hath been ignorantly worshipped , and the Spirit of the Lord hath not truly exercised People's Consciences , nor guided their Zeal , nor been Ruler in the Judgement ; And by this means the sincerity and humility towards God hath been eaten out , and always quenched , and the bare practice of things and profession of Religion in the outward appearance , hath been more looked at , than the Presence of God felt in the Practices : and the Zeal hath been more for the performance of such things , than for God purely enjoyed through them : And thus it hath been through Christ●●●● in the Apostasy since the days of the Apostles and true Churches ; Many have erred in their Judgements , and the Zeal for God 〈◊〉 proceeded our of the error of Judgements , and out of misinformation of Conscience , and some other thing ▪ man only the Spirit of God , hath ruled in the judgement , and been the exercise of people's Consciences . And this is 〈◊〉 of things about true Liberty of Conscience ; and about the Error in judgement ; and the blind Zeal in captivated sincerity . 

Now it may be objected , What is the only absolute Rule of the right Exercise of Conscience ; and when are men's Consciences truly guided ? 

To this I answer , The only chief and perfect Rule of the right Exercise of Conscience , both to God and all men , is , The SPIRIT of CHRIST : for it is only that which can truly guide the Conscience , in Faith , Doctrine and Worship , and in all things towards God ; even the Spirit of CHRIST , which is the gift of the Father , it only leads into all Truth , as it is written ; and all , whose Consciences are guided and exercised by it , are in Unity and Peace in their Worship , Doctrine , and Religion ; for the Spirit of CHRIST is but one in itself , and guideth the Conscience into the exercise of one Truth and Faith ; and in this same Spirit is the true Union and Communion of Saints in Religion and Worship , and this is manifest through the Scriptures ; for the Apostle exhorted to walk in the Spirit , and by it ; and as many as walked by the Rule of the Spirit , peace was upon them : and it is the Spirit of CHRIST , the Everlasting Comforter , that teacheth all Truth ; and the Holy Anointing of the Spirit that dwelled in the Saints , taught them all things ; and they needed no man to teach them , but as the Anointing that dwelled in them . And then are men's Consciences truly guided in all the ways of Righteousness , when the Spirit of God guideth the Conscience , and is the Rule of all Faith , Doctrine and Practices . 

So that Traditions of Men , Prescriptions of Councils , Antiquity of Time , Commandments of Men , nor Example of others , without the Spirit of Christ , cannot be the only true Rule of the Exercise of Conscience : for all these things are changeable , alterable , and subject to variations , and therefore cannot infallibly guide the Conscience in the Duty towards God , nor rightly exercise the Conscience in Unity and Peace ; but while a Nation , or Kingdom , or People walk by the Rule of Traditions , Prescriptions , Commandments of Men , Example of others , or the like , they err in Judgement , in Faith , Doctrine and Worship , and are all divided , and in Contentions about these matters , because their Rule of Conscience and Judgement is doubtful and alterable , and not infallible ; and therefore they have no perfect assurance of God's acceptation to them in their Faith and Religion , nor perfect Peace and Unity in their Faith and Worship ; But as the Rule of their Consciences in their Duty towards God is diverse , some makes one thing and some another their Rule ; so are they diverse and divided , in what they hold , profess and practise , and are but of great Babylon in their Religion : And because that something besides the Spirit of God exerciseth the Conscience ; therefore is it , that here are so many ways and Sects of Religion and kinds of Worship in Christendom , and among Christians , while the Spirit of Christ only is not the Rule of judgement , and Exercise of Conscience to God and Man ; for the only perfect Rule of Conscience in the exercise to God , is the Spirit of Christ , and not any other thing . 

And now , whosoever shall persecute the Exercise of Conscience , when guided by the Spirit of Christ , such persecute Christ jesus : And this is Persecution for the Name of Christ , when Sufferings are inflicted , as Reproaches , Imprisonment , or whatsoever , for the exercise of Conscience towards God by his Spirit : but , and if any are persecuted for Religion-sake , only so , if that in such their Exercise of Religion they are not guided by the Spirit of Christ , yet that suffering is a kind of Persecution also : If , I say , the suffering be only for , and because of their Religion-sake , and they walk justly and righteously as men ; so that ( as is signified about the middle of this Chapter ) though some may profess good Conscience , and cry for Liberty thereof in their false Sect and Religion , not taught them by the Spirit of Christ ; yet the Civil Magistrate ought not to punish and use violence to such for their Religion ; but if they do , they persecute , and the Lord will lay it to their charge . But yet this is safe for all , first to obtain true Liberty of Conscience to Godwards , and to receive the Spirit of Christ , to be taught only by it , in the Exercise of Conscience and Religion , that they may not err in Conscience and judgement in Spiritual matters , nor suffer wrongfully under pretence of Righteousnesse-sake , when as it is not truly so . 

CHAP. IU.  

Concerning the Diversity of Judgements in RELIGION . 

TO all ye that are of diverse Judgements and Opinions in , and concerning Spiritual matters ; who are divided about matters of Faith , Doctrine , Worship , and Church-government ; some of you holding one thing , and some another different and contrary to that ; being diversely divided in mind and heart , concerning the matters that are one in themselves , and to which you all assent , as to the things in themselves , and yet are different and contrary-minded about the selfsame things : To you all I am moved to write , that so ye may be informed perfectly ; first , What the Cause is of your Divisions , and why it is thus amongst you : And secondly , Of the bad Effects and Fruits such Divisions have brought forth : And lastly , the means and way of Reconciliation , that ye may come into Love , and Peace , and Unity with God , and one with another , in all things pertaining to his Kingdom . 

First , The Cause of your Divisions , and of the Diversities of Judgements and Opinions that are amongst you concerning the things and matters of God's Kingdom , is , Because you want the Spirit of God to guide you , and it is not the Rule of your Knowledge and judgement ; and you wanting the Spirit of God , in which is Unity among Saints , therefore is it you are so divided , and diverse , and different , and contrary one to another in these things ; it is , because ye want the Spirit of God , I say , which only teacheth the true Knowledge of God , and gives an Understanding in all his Ways and Matters ; It is the Spirit of God that teacheth true Faith , true Doctrine , and true Worship , and all things about Church , Ministry , and Religion ; and if that you had the Spirit of God in you , and were taught and guided by it , it would teach you into one Faith , and one Truth , and into the true Worship , and into the true Church-government , and you would be in unity and peace ; And if you all had the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures , and by which Spirit the Saints of God were guided in days past , it would teach you into Unity , and to be of one mind , one heart , and one soul in all the matters pertaining to God's Kingdom , in Faith , Worship , Doctrine , and all things else ; if you had the Spirit of God , I say , and were taught by it , than you would have Unity with God , and one with another , in all his ways , and there would have been no Division nor Contention amongst you about Spiritual matters ; but because you want that , therefore you have strife and division amongst you , even throughout all Christendom ; here 's a Nation and a Kingdom holding such a Faith and Worship , and there 's another People holding Faith and Worship contrary to that ; and here 's one Sect of people , and there 's another , different in Faith , judgement , and Opinion ; and this is a shame to whole Christendom , that all should profess Christ jesus , and Faith in him , and Salvation by him , and his Doctrine and Worship , and yet be in strife and division , and in great contentions concerning the same ; some holding and practising one manner of Faith , Worship and Doctrine , and others holding contrary and different ; and this shows that ye are all fallen from the Life of Christianity , as it was held in the Apostles days amongst the true Churches ; for they were of one heart , mind , soul and spirit , as it is written ; they were of one Faith , of one Worship , of one Doctrine , and hand one Way of Church-government ; and this continued amongst the Churches of Christ , till there were some that had erred from the Spirit of God in their own Consciences , and then they also erred in Faith , in Doctrine , and in all other things relating to God : And these were the Apostate Christians that had erred from the Spirit , and divided themselves from the true Church , and differed in judgement amongst themselves ; and this was , because they had erred from the Spirit of God , which would have kept them in unity with God , and one with another : for the Spirit is the Bond of Peace , and the Seal of the Covenant of Love among the Saints . So now all ye who are divided in your Knowledge and judgement , and are in contention one with another about the matters pertaining to God's Kingdom , you are the Apostate Christians , and you are without the Spirit of Christ : The first Apostate Christians erred from the Spirit , and so became divided from the true Faith , and from the true Worship , and also among themselves ; and you never yet received the Spirit of Christ that you might come into Unity and Fellowship with God , and one with another ; and that is the reason of all your Divisions in Religious matters , because you have not received the Spirit of Christ , to teach you , and to unite your hearts to God , and one to another ; but you having the Scriptures , traditionally , by descent through Ages , which do describe and declare of that Faith and Doctrine , and of the Worship and Church-government , which were among the Saints of old , which they held and practised , and from the Scriptures which declare of the things , from thence you take up a Conceit and false Judgement , and an Imitation , and a false Conformity ; and then each sort of you call that your Faith and Church-government , and some after one manner of form , and some after another ; and thus you are divided , because you want the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures ; which Spirit did work true Faith in the hearts of them that gave them forth in days of old , and it taught them Worship , Faith , Doctrine , and all things concerning God's Kingdom , for the Spirit led them into all Truth ; and now you wanting the same Spirit that wrought in them , and taught them ; and you having but their words ( to wit , the Scriptures ) from thence , in the Wisdom which is below , and in the carnal Reason , and in the first man's understanding , each Nation takes up a conceit , that it is so and so , and takes up an Imitation of Worship and Church-government according to their own sensual wisdom , and according to the breadth and depth of their Conceits ; and then imitates , and that severally and diversely , and in a divided manner ; and this is amongst Kingdoms , and amongst Neighbours and brethren , this Division in matters of Faith , Worship and Doctrine , and Church-government ; and yet all these have had the name of Christians , and Church-members , and Worshippers of God , but yet are of many ways of Worship , holding different and contrary Principles of Faith and Doctrine , and also of Worship and Church-government ; and thus have Nations , Cities and Countries been for many Ages ; and thus hath it been , and is at this day amongst the Apostate Christians , that want the Spirit of Christ to be their Rule , of Knowledge , of judgement , and Worship , and of their Faith and Practices in Religion . And this is a shame to whole Christendom , amongst whom the spirit of Antichrist hath entered , which hath thus divided Nations , Cities , Neighbours and Brothers ; for all these Divisions about Religion amongst the Apostate Christians , are of Antichrist , and not of God ; it is that spirit of Antichrist that hath wrought all these Divisions , and planted them in the minds of People . 

Secondly : Concerning the bad Effects of these Divisions in matters of Faith and Worship , as I have said : This Division in Religion hath begotten and brought forth very much Evil throughout the World , much heartburning , envy , hardheartedness , strife and contention between Kings and Rulers , and between Nations , between Cities , between Neighbours , and between Brothers ; this Division hath wrought bad Effects amongst all these ; so that it hath brought forth much War and Bloodshed between Kings , and great Persecutions between Rulers and their People , and great Debate and Strife amongst Neighbours and Friends ; so that great Murders and loss of many Lives have been produced and brought forth upon this Quarrel , about Difference in matters of Faith and Religion ; and Antichrist hath not only divided people in judgement , but hath also provoked people into rage and envy , to the kill and destroying of one another ; and even that Division about Spiritual things , begotten by Antichrist amongst false Christians , hath been turned into personal enmity , and brought forth in the end , murdering and kill the bodies of thousands , when the original debate hath arisen about Church-government , or Points of Religion ; and this is the woeful Effect that Division of Religion hath brought forth in all Christendom . And all this Fruit and Effects , as well as the Cause of it , hath been of Antichrist , and of the Dragon and the Devil throughout the World ; all this Persecution and spoiling of Goods , Imprisoning of persons , taking away of Lives , and Banishment ; and whatsoever Persecution otherwise that hath risen and been inflicted upon any , for and because of Differences in Religion , and about Faith and Worship , all this hath been of Antichrist ; and even all Laws made for that end , and all Executors of such Laws , and all Penalties of such Laws ; and all Wars and Bloodshed whatsoever , that have ensued only and upon the account of Differences in Religion ; that being the first , and the only ground of the Quarrel ; All this hath been of Antichrist , and it came out of the bottomless Pit ; and never rose from the Spirit of God , but from the Antichristian spirit of Envy and Wickedness , that hath first divided people about matters of Faith and Religion , and then provoked them to envy and malice , stirring up Kings to fight one against another , that was not of their Religion , but different and contrary to it : And so the hearts of Rulers have been stirred up to persecute all under them , that were different and contrary in matters of Faith , Worship , and Religion ; and this the spirit of Antichrist hath effected throughout Christendom : and so each King that hath been strongest , would maintain the Principles of his Faith , and the Practice of Religion , according to his own Conceit , in his Dominions : And thus hath Religion , Worships , and Church-government been set up and stood amongst Apostate Christians throughout the World , by Force and Power , and by violent Laws , and through Persecutions and Murders ; and all this hath been by the spirit of Antichrist : and the Spirit of God hath had no hand in those matters , for the setting up and contriving of false Faith , false Worship , and false Church-government ; all this hath depended upon the Powers and Authorities of the Earth , through many Ages : and what Religion , and Church-government , or Way of Worship , that Kings or Queens have set up , that only hath been promoted ; but all the rest persecuted and restrained by force and violence ; and all this hath been of Antichrist . 

And now to all ye that are of diverse Judgements in matters of Faith and Worship in Religion , this is a Caution to you all ; and I do warn you all in the presence of the living God , that though ye be divided in the belief and practice of Spiritual things , yet live in peace and unity with all men , in all outward relations , and do not envy nor hurt one another's persons ; though you are in difference about Religion , yet suffer not that Difference to grow into persecuting or envying one another's persons , but seek to inform one another , and instruct one another in the Spirit of Meekness , and persuade one another out of that which is evil , to that which is good , by patience , gentleness , and long-suffering ; and do not force one another by violence , nor persecute one another , neither by words , evil-deeds , nor actions , but live in love to the persons every one of another ; and fight not with persons , nor kill one another's persons with carnal weapons about Religion , but take the spiritual weapons , and war with the Spirit against the evil one in one another ; and love persons though they are enemies , and this is Christ's Doctrine ; and never hereafter let your divisions about Spiritual things grow into personal quarrels , to the envying or kill one another . And this is a Charge to you all in the presence of the living God.  

Lastly , The Means and Way to be reconciled and to come out of all Division and Strife , and to come into Peace with God , and one with another , about Faith and Church-government , is by the Spirit of God ; and every one of you in particular must receive the Spirit of Christ , that it may work in every one of your hearts , true Faith , and teach every one of you the true Worship of God , and the way of Doctrine , and true Church-government ; it is the Spirit of Christ in every one both male and female , that must reconcile and bring into unity with God , and one with another , in all Spiritual things ; for it is that which is the bond of Peace and Love among true Christians ; and it is that which reconciles people's hearts into oneness : And if you receive that Spirit , every particular person of you , it will bring you to be of one Faith , of one Worship , and then your Doctrine and Church-government will agree : if you receive the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures , it will work in you the same Faith , and lead you in the same way of Worship which the Scriptures speak of , and then you will cease taking up Conceits , and making Imitations of Church-governments from the Letter , but the same Spirit will work in your heart's Faith and Knowledge in the fulfilling of the Scriptures ; and this is true Christianity , and the other is the way of all Apostate Christians , all Imitations from the Letter without the Spirit as gave it forth : for there is a great deal of difference between making a Conformity in the Imitation of a Worship , and Church-government , from the Scriptures without the Spirit , and between the Spirits teaching and leading into the same Truth , and same Worship and Church-government , which the Scriptures speak of ; the one is of Christ , and is in unity , peace , and everlasting fellowship ; the other is of Antichrist , and is in division , strife and contention : so you must all wait for the Spirit of Truth , that you may receive it , to work in your hearts , to teach you , and lead you , or else you will never come to true Union and everlasting Fellowship with God , and one with another ; neither can you be of one true Faith , in one true way of Worship , nor in one way of Church-government , except you receive the Spirit , and walk in the Spirit . And these be the words of the Lord God unto you all . 

Now as concerning the way of Uniformity in Faith and Church-government , imposed upon Nations , and Countries and Cities , by cruel Laws of Kings and Rulers , as hath been the practice through Christendom , to cause a whole Nation and Kingdom to bow and conform to such Principles of Faith , and Worship , and Church-government , according to the will and pleasure of a King , or a Ruler , such Uniformity and Union and Fellowship among Christians hath not been of Christ , where people have walked by Imitation , and conformed to the commands of Men in such a Faith , or to such a Worship or Church-government ; this hath not been of God , neither could this Unity stand or remain for ever , but it hath perished , and will perish where ever it is ; and that Faith and Worship , and Church-government which is so set up , and so held , will never save the Soul , nor comfort it ; but it is blasted of God : whilst a Nation , or a Kingdom , or a People have Uniformity , or hold Faith , Worship , or Religion , either in the ignorance of their Consciences , or contrary to their Consciences , by the force of men's Commandments , and not by the persuasion of the Spirit of God in their own Consciences ; such Conformity , I say , is of Antichrist , and not of the Father , neither can it stand in the Day of the Lord ; but the fire of his Wrath will consume it : All the Apostate Christians in their Uniformity of Faith , Worship , and Church-government , which is some other way , or by some other means , than only by the Spirit of God , is of Antichrist , and will be confounded : for there is no true Unity and Fellowship in the Ways of God , and his Truth and Worship , but what is in the Spirit , and that Unity will stand for ever , for it is in GOD ; not feigned , neither because of the love and fear of this world , as the other is . That Uniformity in Faith and Worship which is forced upon People , is all but hypocrisy and deceit , both to God and man , and God will judge it in the Imposers , and Imposed : Therefore no true Unity in Faith , nor Worship , nor in Religion but what is in and by the Spirit of God : for as 〈◊〉 come to divide themselves into many ways , and into diverse Sects when they went from the Spirit of God , and lost it , and whilst they have been without the Spirit they have remained in Division , Strife , and Contention about Religion ; so now the means and way of true Union and Fellowship , and Faith , is by receiving the Spirit of God again , and not any otherwise : and as Christians are brought again to receive this Spirit , and walk therein , all division and strife about Religion will cease , and the cursed fruits and effects thereof will also wither and be no more ; but then Unity , Peace , Blessedness , Everlasting Fellowship and Comfort with the Lord , and one with another , in all his Ways , will be witnessed amongst all People . 

THE END .
