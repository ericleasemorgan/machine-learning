TO THE READER , 

I Have studied to make all the answers short in these three Catechisms , for the help of thy memory : First to know , and then to do , is perfect Christianity . 

TO The most Religious , and Noble Lady , the Countess of Argyle , etc.  

MADAM , 

This world is full of people , whose religion is compounded like the TURKISH , in part CHRISTIAN , in part JEW , in part WORLDLING , in part ATHEIST , in part as A grippa , almost Christians : Only these are happy , who according to the Apostle his wish , are altogether Christians . 

A time of trial will come , which shall discern almost from altogether : Happy shall these professors be , to whom the Lord shall say , Ye are these which have continued with me in my temptations ; and I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me , that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; of all honours this shall be found the greatest . 

GOD , Madam , hath highly honoured your La. both with grace and place : As for grace , ye may without flattery , with S. johns' Lady , be called the ELECT LADY : As for place , Ye both by birth and marriage are high , but highest in this , that your La. art humble . 

I will not here enter into a large discourse , concerning the Noble and Potent Earl your La. Husband , whose virtues have most Oriently shined in our general Assembly , which his Lordship did much honour with his presence , and help with his counsel . 

That which the Apostle did require for the house of Onesiphorus , that I most heartily wish to his Lordship , to your La. and to all your noble Line and Family , that the Lord grant that ye may find mercy of the Lord in that day . 

Let it please your La. graciously to accept of this little labour , and to honour it with your favour , it shall be but an EARNEST of more , if I live , and if God permit . 

From Glasgow the 14. of januar , 1639.  Your Ladyships in all humble duty and observance M. ZACHARY BOYD

A prayer at the hour of Death . 

Because death is very uncertain ; and Pastors can not be ever pray sent at the last hour of dying men , I have set down this Prayer for the come for 't of such , 

MOST gracious GOD , most dear and loving Father , let the words of our mouth , and the meditations of our heart , be acceptable in thy sight , for thou art our Lord , our strength and our Redeemer : We most unworthy to speak for ourselves , are hold here to call upon thee , and most humbly to entreat thee , to be gracious and merciful to this thy faithful servant , now going from the earth to his long home in the heavens . 

thou Lord Jesus , who can not lie , hast said unto us : That whatsoever we shall ask the Father in thy name , thou wilt give it unto us ; OH Father of mercies , we seek from thee , in the name of thy Son Jesus , that all the sins of this thy now dying servant may be forgotten , and fully and freely forgiven him : though his sins have indeed been red like Scarlet and Crimson , let it please thee so to wash him with the virtue of the blood of Jesus , that his soul once polluted and defiled with sin , may be made white like the wool ▪ yea , whiter than the snow . 

thou Lord understandest the groans of thine own Spirit ; thou hast begun a good work in him ; now as thou dost with the year , crown it with thy goodness : seal up in his heart that peace which thou hast purchased with the blood of Christ Jesus , the Prince of peace ; Assure him now of the rest of these joys , whereof he in his life hath had by thy grace a merciful foretaste , in the very throes of death , & greatest throngs of temptations ; uphold him with the hope of glory : Let his faith get a full victory over all the enemies of his salvation : Let the virtue of Christ's Cross crucify the world unto him , and him unto the world ; let the death of Jesus be the death of his sins , and the life of his soul . Say unto his soul , Be of good comfort , all thy sins are forgiven thee . 

Seeing while he is here at home in the body , he is absent from the Lord , make thou him confident and willing rather to be absent from the body , that he may be present with thee his Lord in the heavens , among the Angels and and spirits of just men , who are always in thy presence , beholding thy face , wherein is fullness of joy . 

Now Lord , while his flesh and his heart fail him , be thou the strength of his heart , and his portion for ever ; for whom hath he in heaven but thee , and there is none on earth whom he desire's besides thee : make haste Lord , come Lord , Jesus come . Open now the doors of thy mercy , and suffer this wearied traveller to enter into thine everlasting rest . 

OH Spirit of comforts , the Comforter of troubled souls , seal up in his heart the pardon of all sins , with the blood of Jesus , and now crown all thy gifts and graces in him with thy glory , Lord Jesus receive his spirit , Father into thine hands we commend his soul ; To the Father , Son and holy Ghost , be everlasting glory , praise , power and dominion , for ever , and ever , Amen .
