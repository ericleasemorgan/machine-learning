To the reader . 

Ihave too often ( and not without regret ) beheld those monstrous births which have been forced into the world by the unskilful and injurious midwifery of scribblers , stationers , and printers , often the death of their pretended parents ; indeed , who would not be troubled to see the innocent names of eminent divines made ( as it were ) to do penance in the printers sheets , for the incontinency of their wanton auditors , who between the pen and the press , beget and bring forth a bastard brood of sermons , which they must father ? 

how greatly that reverend man of God dr. John Hewit ( since his suffering death ) hath upon this account suffered from his seeming friends , is obvious to every intelligent eye ; witness two books of sermons printed and published under his name , and ( notwithstanding some of them appear to be translations out of French authors ) pretended to be his ; which was done too , both against a special caveat entered in Stationers-hall by his honourable Lady and advertisements in print by two of his worthy friends , viz. dr. Wild , and Mr. Barwick , whose names have been made use of without their privity or consent ; to stand in place and show of licensers of those sermons , which they utterly disowned , and desire by this means publicly to disclaim . 

this having been the lot of so many preachers of the gospel , and those men famous in their generation , i do not much wonder , and am the less troubled that it is mine ; only i must needs resent ( yet not without a readiness to forgive ) the impudence of those , who have , as to were , ravished my sermon before my face , dealing so injuriously by me whilst alive . by this i plainly foresee what is to be expected when i am dead : the consideration whereof , hath been , and is one cause inducing me to appear so often in print , that what is ( i ingenuously confess ) but very imperfect at the best , May not however come forth mangled hereafter . 

i hope the candid reader will not think his patience abused , whilst i shall in a few words inform him how much i have been abused in this kind . 

some years ago came forth a little manual of several prayers , whereof that , to which my name is affixed , is for the most part made up of such expressions , which ( how good soever they May be in themselves ) were not wont to be used by me , as appeareth by that prayer , which ( for this reason ) i prefixed before the first part of my exposition upon St. John's first epistle . 

I met this last summer with a book called the herbal of divinity , upon the title page whereof ( the authors name being concealed ) my name is affixed to great letters , to a part of a sentence with which i began a sermon preached at St.  Gregory's on low Sunday last , upon that text which is plaâ€¢ed in the front of that discourse , namely the 26th of Isaia . and the 19th verse . for this cause ( very probably ) that the unwary reader Might believe it to be mine . 

within these few weeks , i have perused a discourse in part mine , and but in part ( as will appear by the ensuing sermon ) printed and published without my knowledge . indeed , i heard a flying rumour , and received a nameless letter , threatening the publication of it , but i was not willing to believe any would be so audacious , till now i see it . it is true , my name is not expressed ; but it is said to be a sermon preached at that place , and on that day , and upon the text , where , when , and on which i preached : and which proclaimeth the insolence of these publishers , though they never had any conference with me , either before or since my preaching , yet they presume to know my thoughts , in that it is said to be intended for the solemnization of doctor Hewits' funeral : whereas in truth , i was engaged to preach that turn at St.  Gregory's before the doctor's death ; yea , when there was some hopes of his life . and though i deny not but that sad providence intervening , occasioned me to pitch my thoughts on that subject ; yet had i intended it for his funeral , i justly could , and certainly should , have given a far more ample character of his worth . 

If now the reader shall desire to know what was my real intent in preaching this following sermon at that time , the close of it will inform him , that it was no other then what ought to be one end of all preaching , namely , to bring the persons to repentance . and observing a general sadness of compassion upon their spirits , i was willing so to frame my discourse , that through God's grace , a sorrow of compunction Might accompany it . 

What was then preached , and hath been hitherto withheld from the press ( partly out of a mean opinion of the work itself , and partly out of a just desire not to exasperate ) i am now necessitated to publish for my own vindication , and that what was the preachers aim May be effected upon all who then heard , or shall now read it , is and shall be his earnest and uncessant request at the throne of grace . amen .

The sad prognostic of approaching judgement . 

Isaiah 57th chapt. verse the first . 

The righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart , and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come . 



Our prophet Isaiah in his two and twentieth chapter , tells us of a day wherein the Lord God of hosts calls to weeping and mourning , and though ( Since every day is a day of sinning ) every day ought to be a day of mourning ; yet there are four special days wherein God expects this duty from us : 

The day of any heinous wickedness committed by our selves or others . 

The day of any grievous judgement , either national or personal inflicted . 

The day wherein the wicked prosper , and the ungodly triumph . and 

The day wherein any of God's faithful and eminent servants are snatched away and cut off by death . 

It is not many days ( beloved ) since there was such a day , and of such a day it is my text speaks ; the want of a due and serious consideration whereof , moved our prophet to take up this bitter lamentation , the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart , &c.  

This sad and sorrowful complaint looks two ways , to the godly , and to the wicked ; bewailing the misery of the one , and bemoaning the iniquity of the other , that the persons of the godly were destroyed , and the hearts of the wicked hardened . That ariseth from grief , this from grief mixed with anger ; both very vehement , as appeareth by the multiplication of several clauses to the same sense . God grant that i in handling , and you in hearing , May have the same holy passions which our prophet had in uttering this doleful ditty , the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart , &c.  

begin we with the complaint concerning the godly , which we find to be both amplified and mitigated ; amplified in two clauses , the righteous perisheth , the merciful men are taken away : mitigated in one , they are taken away from the evil to come . 

In the enlarging of the complaint , we shall consider the godly man's disposition and condition . That really very good , this seemingly very bad ; both characterizedin two words : his disposition , in those two , righteous and merciful ; his condition in those two , perisheth and taken away : of each a word . 

1.  The first thing we are to take notice of , is the godly man's disposition . and that 

1.  As described in the word righteous , a word which being in the Hebrew in the singular number , and having an article prefixed , is by some expositors peculiarly applied to Christ , as if this verse were a prophecy of his death . indeed , to him especially and primarily doth this title of righteous belong . there is none righteous , no not one , ( Saith the psalmist . ) Except one , ( Saith the father ; ) meaning Christ , who is perfectly and originally righteous : in which respect the prophet Malachy calls him the sun of righteousness . Righteousness in us , like light in the moon , hath its spots and imperfections : we at best , are but stars of righteousness , which shine with a borrowed light : Christ , like the sun , hath in himself a fullness of grace , of which we receive grace for grace . of this righteous person it is true , that he perished in the opinion , and was taken away by the rage of his enemies : nay , which too truly answereth the text , he died unlamented by the generality of the persons ; so that he Might well have uttered upon the cross those words of the church , is it nothing to you all that pass by ? Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me , wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger . 

But when i observe the other character to be in the plural number , merciful men , i rather incline to understand this word though in the singular , as nomen collectivum , referring not to one , but many , and accordingly those prophets and messengers of the Lord , together with the other of his faithful servants which were slain in the days of Manasseh , who shed innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem with blood from one end to the other , are conceived by expositors to be those whom the prophet here bemoaneth . 

If it shall be now enquired in what notion this term righteous was attributed to them , and May be affirmed of every godly man ? I answer , they are righteous in a threefold sense , really , interpretatively , comparatively . 

1.  Every godly man is really righteous , inasmuch as 

1.  His person is justified through our Lord Jesus Christ , who is therefore called by the prophet Jeremy , the Lord our righteousness , and is said by the prophet Isaiah , to cover us with the robe of righteousness , and by st Paul , to be made of God unto us righteousness . thus as all men are sinners in the first , so are all believers righteous in the second Adam . this is that righteousness which is purely evangelical , and is called the righteousness of faith , because the righteousness of Christ apprehend by faith : hence it comes to pass that as the father elegantly , quod lex operum monendo imperat , lex fidei credendo impetrate ; that righteousness which the law requireth , faith obtains . 

2.  His nature is renewed after the image of God , which St. Paul tells us consists in righteousness and true holiness : in this respect it is that believers are said to partake of the ( Or rather a ) divine nature by the apostle Peter , and to be born of God by the apostle John , because after a sort they are righteous as God is righteous : well May the name righteous be given , where the new divine nature is conferred , which maketh us of unholy , holy , of vicious , virtuous , of unjust , righteous . 

3.  His life is reform , and in some measure ordered according to the rule of righteousness , the word of God ; he that doth righteousness saith saint John , is righteous ; every good man doth righteousness , though not exactly , yet sincerely ; his aim and endeavour is to give God and man their due , tribute to whom tribute , custom to whom custom , fear to whom fear , honour to whom honour belongeth . 

2.  Every godly man is righteous interpretatively , inasmuch as being justified by Christ , and sanctified by the spirit , God doth account , accept of him as righteous . the same word in the Hebrew signifieth upright and perfect ; to teach us that upright persons are ( For Christ's sake ) accepted of God , as if they were perfect . well Might the prophet , well May we call them righteous , whom God calls so ; and we find upon record , Noah , Job , with others , to be commended by God himself as righteous . 

3.  Every godly man is righteous comparatively , in respect of the wicked among whom he lives : thus these of whom our prophet here speaketh , being compared with those voluptuous epicures mentioned in the end of the former chapter , Might well be styled righteous . look how the saints are said to be worthy ; so they May be said to be righteous , quantum ad comparationem caeterorum , to wit in comparison of others . indeed on the one hand the most holy man compared with God and Christ is unjust and impure , and therefore it is when the saints have looked upon God , they abhor themselves . but on the other hand compared with the wicked , they are justly esteemed righteous : when the actions of the good and the bad are set together , the prayers , tears , fasts , and alms of the one , by the oaths , jollities , cursings , and oppressions of the other , they become so much the more conspicuous ; and as although silver be far below gold , yet it is very precious in comparison of lead and iron ; so the servants of God , though infinitely short of his purity and righteousness , are righteous if compared with the ungodly and profane . 

2.  Having discovered to you the first character of righteous ; proceed we to a view of the second , which is merciful . according to the Hebrew , it May be read men of mercy and good will , and so construed either passively or actively . 

1.  In a passive sense , men of mercy and good will , are those upon whom God will have mercy , and to whom he beareth a singular good will , the Lord is good unto all , and his tender mercies are over all his works ( Saith the psalmist ) there being no creature so mean and base , which giveth not a specimen of his goodness , but yet his delights are with the sons of men , and his love to mankind , is greater than to any of his creatures : upon which account the psalmist saith a little before , Lord , what is man , that thou takest knowledge of him , or the son of man that thou makest account of him ? and as God hath a more special love to man then any other creatures , so he hath a more peculiar love to the righteous than any other men ; in which respect the psalmist saith elsewhere , thou Lord wilt bless the righteous , with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield . 

In this construction , there is very good use to be made of the word in this scripture . 

1.  partly to inform us , that they who perish in this world , May yet be God's favourites . Men are apt to think that God should not let the wind blow upon his darlings , but they are deceived , his love is not a motherly and cockering , but a fatherly and prudent love . Benjamin was not the less regarded by Joseph , because the cup was found in his sack : we must not infer from the presence of outward afflictions , the absence of divine affection . when he who was the righteous one , of whom the father said , this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased , was a man of sorrows , and acquainted with griefs : yea , upon the cross , breathed forth that doleful language , my God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? as being left by God , to the will of his enemies . let us not doubt , but that righteous persons , though they perish by the malice of men , are yet in favour with God . 

2.  partly to comfort righteous ones in the midst of all their sufferings , considering that while the world frowns , God smiles . Though the cold wind of persecution blow , yet the sunbeams of divine affection shines upon them : though they are rejected as dross by men , yet they are accounted by God as his jewels . what matters it for men's hatred , so we have heavens love ? this May make the righteous not only contented but cheerful in suffering the cruelty of their enemies , that they are the men whom God marks out for the objects of his mercy . 

2.  But though this construction be pious and congruous , yet i rather incline to the active notion of these words ; so much the rather , because of that parallel place in the prophet Micah , where it is said , the good man is perished out of the earth . in this sense , men of mercy , are such as exercise mercy towards them that are in misery . 

mercy in its general notion , is alienis miserijs condolere easque proviribus sublevare ; a tender condolence with others miseries , and a ready willingness to succour them according to our ability . such is the activity of this grace , that it runs through the whole man . 

In the understanding , it is a serious consideration how we May do good . The liberal man ( Saith the prophet ) deviseth liberal things . his thoughts are taken up with consulting for the relief of the distressed . 

In the memory , it is a continual setting the miseries of our brethren before us . the merciful man forgetteth the injuries that are done to himself , and remembers the miseries that are suffered by others ; he still thinketh he heareth them groaning , and seeth them bleeding . 

In the will and affection , it is a sweet sympathy , whereby we do nolle malum , velle bonum , nill the evil , and will the good of another . The merciful man's heart aketh for his brethren , and he resents their sufferings , as if they were his own . 

Nor doth mercy only retire itself into the chambers of the soul , but looketh out at the windows , and goeth out of doors for the succour of the afflicted . It opens the eye to see and search out the miserable , which , beholding them ; maketh report to the heart , and that being affected with sorrow , causeth the eye to drop down tears ; it quickeneth the ear to attend and listen to the cries of the calamitous , like the tender nurse , which heareth the least whimpering of the child : it unlooseth the tongue to speak a word in season , pleading with God and man for them : it puts under the shoulder to bear a part of the burden , according to that apostolical counsel , bear you one another's burdens . it unclaspeth the hand to relieve , and knocketh off the fetters from the feet : so that they are ready to go , nay run in behalf of the miserable . In one word , the merciful man's head is full of thoughts , his heart of sorrows , his eyes of tears , mouth of prayers , and hands of gifts . 

Thus every truly godly man is not only just , but good , righteous , but merciful : he puts on viscera , bowels of mercy and tender compassions towards them that are afflicted ; he is ready to do opera , works of mercy , according to his power . by the one , he draws out his soul to the hungry ; by the other , he reacheth forth his hand to the needy . Righteous men know that alms is the poor man's due , and mercy is a debt they owe to the miserable : no wonder if they are careful to pay it . 

And look how far the misery of the distressed reacheth , so far the mercy of the righteous extendeth ; both to the souls and bodies of others . Namely , they are men of mercy , especially to the souls of others ; instructing the ignorant , confirming the weak , counselling the doubtful , warning the unruly , persuading the obstinate , and comforting the grieved . nor are they unmindful of the bodies of others , clothing the naked , feeding the hungry , refreshing the thirsty , visiting the sick , and entertaining the stranger . 

Nor is their mercy only confined to friends , but enlarged to foes : they are men of good will , even to those that bear them ill will : they do good , where they have received evil : they requite injuries with courtesies , and want not compassion for those who are the instruments of their passion . 

Whilst then the jesuited saints wear the red coat of blood and cruelty , let God's holy ones be clothed in the white of innocency and pity , and whilst their zeal flames in fury , let our love shine in mercy . whatever they pretend , they are no other than sons of Belial , who delight in blood ; who slay the fatherless and the widow , and make persons , families , May nations , miserable . He hath showed thee , oh man , what is good , and what the Lord thy god requireth of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God ? so we read in the prophecy of Micah , sow to yourselves in righteousness , and reap in mercy , that is the prophet Hosea his counsel . Christ's blessed ones , are such as hunger after righteousness , and withal are merciful . and here the characters of a godly man are righteous and merciful . i have done with the first branch , which is the saints pious disposition , i now hasten to 

2.  His calamitous condition , which is represented in those words , perisheth , and taken away . 

The first word perisheth , which is of a large acception , May be capable of an harsh construction , and such as cannot be predicated of a righteous man ; in which respect Eliphaz said to Job , remember , i pray thee , who ever perished being innocent , or where were the righteous cut off ? that ye May therefore rightly understand the meaning of the phrase , know , that there is a threefold perishing . 

The first belongs neither to the righteous , nor to the wicked ; the second is proper only to the wicked ; the third is common to the righteous , with the wicked . 

1.  perishing in its most strict notion , is transitus ab esse ad non esse , a passage from being to not being ; an utter extinction , a total annihilation . and in this sense only the beast perisheth , which dying , is resolved into its first principles , and at last into nothing . though therefore the wicked man is said to be like the beast that perisheth , yet he doth not perish like the beast ; indeed , it were happy for him if he Might : for though some endeavour by their metaphysical notions , to prove a miserable being , better than no being , yet they must give us leave to say with our saviour , it were good for that man he had never been born . nor is it to be doubted , but that the damned heartily wish , not to be at all , but ( Alas ) it cannot be . 

2.  There is a perishing , which is peculiar to the wicked , and this is two fold ; either perishing in his name , or perishing in his person . 

1.  only wicked men perish in their names , whilst their memorial is cut off from the earth . though the righteous die , yet their names live : that malice which takes away their life , cannot extinguish their memory ; but the wicked perish , so as to be wholly forgotten , or remembered with infamy : so true is that of the wise man , the memory of the just is blessed , but the name of the wicked shall rot . 

2.  only wicked men perish in their persons , that is , soul and body . this is that perishing , which is opposed by our saviour to eternal life ; and is sometimes called the second death . in this sense , to perish , is to be eternally miserable ; to be ever perishing , and yet never perished . and thus , who ever perished being righteous ? indeed st Peter saith , the righteous are scarcely saved , but there is a great deal of differenre between scarcely , and almost : though he is scarcely saved , that is , not without great difficulty , yet he is saved by God's mercy from this perishing . 

3.  But lastly , there is a perishing which is common to the righteous and the wicked , and thus the righteous as well as the wicked perish , by the miseries of life , and at length by death . 

1.  They perish by the miseries of this life ; in which sense , perishing is opposed to prospering : good men are exposed to dangers in this world , as well as the bad ; nay , more than the bad . that chosen vessel st Paul , reckons a multitude of dangers which befell him in this life , where he tells us , that he was in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils of his own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ; and surely what befell him , is incident to the most righteous persons . 

2.  They perish by death . in this sense the disciple meant it , when they cried , Master , we perish . thus Elihu expounds it , when he saith , all flesh shall perish together , and men shall turn again unto dust . and this our prophet intends , when he saith , the righteous perisheth . 

If you shall ask , why dying , which is only a separation of the soul from the body , not an annihilation of either , is called a perishing ? i answer : 

1.  It is a perishing , though not {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , yet {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in reality , yet appearance ; though not secundum rei veritatem , according to the verity of the thing , yet secundum communem sensum , according to the opinion of the vulgar . when any man dyeth , whether good or bad , he seemeth as one that were perished . and though ( As our blessed saviour telleth us ) all live to God , yet as musculus glosseth upon the text , in mundi judicio , in the judgement of the world , they perish . 

2.  It is a perishing , though not absolutÃ¨ , yet respectiuÃ¨ , absolutely yet respectively ; it is a perishing as to this world . when any man dieth , as well righteous as wicked , he so perisheth , as that he shall never again live here : upon which account it is said , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ? yea , holy Job saith of himself , i go whence i shall not return . this is that which is expressed in that parallel scripture to this , where the prophet saith , the good man is perished out of the earth . he is not perished , so as not to be at all , yet he is perished so , as to be no more upon earth . and this is all that the prophet means , when he saith , the righteous perisheth . 

2.  This will yet further appear , if you look upon the other word , where it is said , that merciful men are taken away . as the providence of God in nature , hath made those members double , which are most useful , as the eyes , ears , hands , and feet , that if one fail , the other May supply ; so the wisdom of God in scripture , hath coupled phrases together , that if the one be obscure , the other May explain ; if the one be harsh , the other May mollify it . It is so here ; whereas that phrase of perishing is somewhat dark and rugged , here is another word , taking away , which serveth very much to qualify and illustrate it . 

The Hebrew word {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} hath a double construction , both which are here made use of , namely to gather , and to take away . 

Calvin reads it colliguntur , merciful men are gathered . death seemeth to be a scattering , and so a perishing , but indeed it is a gathering , when men die , especially good men , they are gathered . so that in this sense it is a great allay to the bitterness of the other word perisheth . 

2.  lapide with others-read it auferuntur , with which our translation agreeth , are taken away , and no doubt it is the most genuine rendering of the word in this place , since this Hebrew word , where it signifieth to gather , is usually joined with the preposition signifying to , whereas here in the very next clause it is joined with a preposition signifying from , and therefore most fitly translated , taken away . 

And now that which the prophet intends by this phrase , is to note two things , 

1.  In general , by taking away , is meant dying , obitus , abitus , death is often called a going away , a departure , and thus it mollifieth the former word , perisheth , letting us see that it is not an extinction , but only a remotion , an abolition , but an ablation ; when we die , we do not cease to be at all , only we change our place , and are taken away out of this world . 

2.  More particularly , by taking away is meant a violent death , a dying , when in course of nature a man Might have lived long ; it is one thing for a candle to go out of it self , and another to be blown out by the wind ; it is one thing for a flower to wither , and another to be blasted ; it is one thing for a tree to fall , and another to be plucked up by the roots : finally , it is one thing for a man to go away , and another to be taken away from any place ; those are emblems of a natural , these of a violent death in this notion this word addeth something to the former phrase , namely , the manner of the death , the righteous perisheth , and that not in a natural way , but is taken away by the hand of violence . 

The result of what hath been said on this first general , amounts to these two things . 

1.  That righteous and merciful men perish , and are taken away by death . indeed it is said of Enoch , God took him that he should not see death , so was Eliah ; and had God so pleased , he Might have exempted all righteous men from death , but then neither his power in raising them to life , would have been so illustrious , nor their faith and hope in believing and expecting a resurrection , so conspicuous , in which latter respect the father saith well , that had good men been privileged from death , Carni quidem faelicitas adderetur , adimeretur autem fidei fortitudo , though it Might have been some kind of advantage to the frailty of our flesh , yet it would much have detracted from the strength of out faith : in great wisdom therefore hath God so ordered it , that righteous and merciful men , as well as others , should walk through the valley of the shadow of death . indeed our saviour's assertion is universal , he that keepeth my sayings shall not see death , but he meaneth the second death ; and so else where he explaineth himself , when he saith , he that believeth in me shall not die for ever . true it is , Solomon tells us , that righteousness delivereth from death , but it is from the evil , not from the being of death , death indeed is an advantage to a good man , yet still die he must : but this is not all which the prophet here intends , since this perishing and taking away by death , being that which is appointed for all , seemeth not to be a matter of much lamentation ; and therefore thâ€¢t which no doubt is further aimed at in these expressions , is , 

2.  That sometimes righteous and merciful men perish , and are taken away by a violent death . Indeed it is that which is threatened by God as a curse upon wicked , especially bloodthirsty and deceitful men ; it is that which malefactors are sentenced to by the justice of the judge ; but yet withal it is that which May and sometimes doth befall God's own servants ; nay which is more strange , and yet is many times true , the righteous are taken away , whilst the wicked remain . Solomon observed it in his time , there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness , and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness ; yea which is yet most sad , but very frequent , the righteous perish by the wicked , and that for righteousness sake , and the merciful are taken away by cruel hands , and that for piety's sake : wicked men never want malice in their hearts , and sometimes ( Through divine permission ) have power in their hands to take away the liberties , estates , and lives of the righteous . One of the first good men that was in the world began this bitter cup , which many both men of God and other godly men have since pledged . it was the complaint of the church in the old testament , and St. Paul taketh it up as most truly applicable to the church of the new , for thy sake we are killed all the day long , and are accounted as sheep for the slaughter . 

This is that which the wise God suffers to come to pass for many excellent ends . 

That wicked men by such bloody acts , May fill up the measure of their sins , and thereby at once hasten and heighten their punishment . 

That good men May have occasion of exercising and manifesting many graces particularly , the length of their patience ; the height of their courage ; and the depth of their charity . when a man endureth to the end , suffering even death itself , patience hath its perfect work . that 's a resolution indeed which maketh a man faithful to the death , and enableth him to look upon its pale visage with confidence . there cannot be greater charity then to forgive my enemy ; especially when he persecuteth me to the death . so that when righteous men perish violently , their graces flourish gloriously . 

That hereby righteous men May be fully conformable to the righteous one , the Messiah , concerning whom this prophet foretelleth that he should be cut off ( As the tree is by the axe ) from the land of the living . and in respect of which the apostle chargeth those Jews , that by wicked hands they had taken and slain him . 

Finally , that by so perishing , the religion which they profess , May be honoured , and the God whom they serve , glorified . since though both these are in some measure effected by doing well , and living uprightly , yet much more by suffering ill , and dying cheerfully in a righteous cause . 

And now what should the consideration hereof teach us , but 

1.  That certainly there is another world besides this , wherein a difference shall be put between the righteous and the wicked ; between him that feareth God , and him that feareth him not . Here the righteous perish as well as the wicked ; nay , the righteous perish , and the wicked prosper , and the merciful are taken away by the wicked . but shall it be so always ? will not the judge of all the world do right ? will there not be a reward for the righteous ? yes doubtless . and since in this world all things fall alike to all , and for the most part it fareth better with the wicked than the godly , it necessarily followeth that there is a state after death , wherein the righteous judgement of God in punishing the wicked , who now prosper , and recompensing the righteous , who now perish , shall be made manifest . 

2.  That it is a needful prudence , in righteous and merciful men , to improve their time and talents in serving God , and doing good to others whilst they live . they must perish at last by a natural , they May be taken away soon by a violent death ; and when they perish , all ability and opportunity will be taken away of doing good works , either of piety or pity , justice or mercy . oh then , how great industry and celerity is needful in putting forth themselves to the utmost for God , their souls , their brethren whilst they live ! that they May do much in a little time , according to that sage advice of the wise man , whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might , for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave whether thou goest . 

3.  That sowing in righteousness , and reaping in mercy , they would not be discouraged from the apprehension of this perishing and taking away . i am afraid such thoughts as these do sometimes arise in the minds of men : how dieth the wise man even as the fool , the righteous as the wicked ? Let me live never so well , i must perish : nay , my conscientious walking May occasion my ruin . How much better is it to spend my days in pleasure , and indulge to my lusts whilst i live , since i can but die at last ? but far be such reasonings from wise and righteous men , especially when we consider how great a mercy the very perishing of the righteous , and taking away of the merciful is ; which will appear , if we proceed to the 

2.  mitigation of the complaint , as it is expressed in the close of the verse , the righteous are taken away from the evil to come . 

There are ( According to the known distinction of the schools ) two sorts of evil , the one of sin , and the other of punishment ; and it is true in reference to both . 

1.  When righteous men die , they are taken away from the evil of sin , into which they are prone to fall , so long as they live . Nusquam tuta est humana fragilitas , saith St. Herome , human frailty is never safe . in this world we are continually assaulted , and sometimes captivated ; but death puts us out of all danger ; we shall be tempted no longer , and sin no more . 

2.  But no doubt it is the evil of punishment which here the prophet intends , and thus it May admit of a double notion . 

1.  They are taken away from those ordinary personal evils , to which they , with the rest of mankind , are subject in this world . the best men whilst they live here , are exposed to ashes , pains , sicknesses , losses , crosses ; manifold troubles and miseries : but when they die , all tears are wiped away from their eyes : fears removed from their hearts : they rest from their labours , so St. John . they enter into peace ; they rest in their beds , so our prophet in the very next verse . 

2.  But that which is here principally meant , is , that the righteous and merciful are taken away by death , from some extraordinary and publipue evil of judgement , which is to come upon the place where they live . Those words of the prophet , come my persons , enter thou into thy chambers , shut thy doors about thee ; hide thyself as it were for a little moment , while the indignation be overpast ; are by some expounded of the chambers of the grave , in which God is pleased to hide his persons , before he cometh forth of his place to punish the inhabitants of the world . 

Indeed , this is not always the dispensation of divine providence . sometimes the righteous are taken away in the common calamity , together with the wicked . the fruitful and barren trees are blown down at once by the same wind of judgement . perhaps , good men , have by sinful compliances , been involved in the national guilt , and no wonder if they are also involved in the notional punishment . 

sometimes the righteous are delivered from the common misery , and yet not taken away by death . whilst the whole world is overwhelmed with a deluge of waters , Noah is preserved alive in the ark . when Sodom is to be destroyed , Lot is sent to Zoar : and when Jerusalem is to be overthrown , the godly are admonished to go to Pella . that promise in the psalms , hath been sometimes literally and fully verified in a time of pestilential infection , a thousand shall fall on thy right hand , and ten thousand on thy left , but it shall not come night thee . God sets a mark upon the mourners , and the destroying angel passeth by them as he did by the Israelites houses in Egypt . 

And then sometimes the righteous are taken away by death , before the general desolation come . Thus God dealt with Josiah that good King , before the captivity of Israel : St. Austin ( That godly father ) before the destruction of Hippo ; and Luther that eminent dr. before the devastation of Germany . 

before i go any further , it will not be amiss to take notice how this truth unfolds the riddle , and cleareth the seeming injustice of divine proceedings . we oft-times see , and seeing , wonder ; nay , perhaps repine at it , that good men are taken out of , whilst wicked men continue in this world . but surely this can be no just cause of casting any blemish upon divine dispensations , when we consider that 

On the one hand the wicked are preserved , but it is for the evil to come . they escape for a time , that some remarkable judgement May fall upon them . As the voice told that wicked wretch , when sleeping under a rotten wall , it awaked him , and saved him from the ruin . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , i saved thee from the wall , reserving thee for the wheel . 

On the other hand , the righteoas are indeed taken away , but it is from the evil to come . so that whilst the wicked man's preservation is a curse , the good man's perishing is a favour . God spareth the one in anger , and taketh away the other in mercy . 

Indeed , righteous men are taken away from the evil to come , upon a double account . 

1.  ne veniat , that the evil which is to come upon the place May not come upon them : God will not have his righteous ones to be spectators of , nor sufferers in those ruins , which his justice hath decreed to inflict upon the wicked for their sins . this is rendered as the reason why that immature death befell Josiah who was slain in the battle that he Might not see the evil which was coming . 

2.  ut veniat , that the evil May come and be inflicted on the place : for ( beloved ) you must know that whilst righteous men live , they are very prevalent with God by their prayers and tears to keep off judgement : unus homo plus valet orando , quam mille pugnando , one righteous man can do more by prayer , than a thousand by arms . Let me alone saith God to Moses , that my wrath May wax hot against this persons , fatetur se Moysis orationibus teneri , so the gloss : God seemeth to confess that his hands were as it were tied by Moses his prayer , so that he could not punish that idolatrous persons . i can do nothing ( Said the angel to Lot ) whilst thou art here , good men stand in the gap to turn away the wrath of God from the nation where they live : and therefore when God is resolved , and the time prefixed is accomplished , that he will destroy a persons , he suffereth the wicked to fill up the measure of their sins , by killing his servants : or else he appoints some other means by which they are removed out of this world from the evil to come . 

The meditation of this truth affords matter of 

1.  comfort to the righteous , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , said the Greek poet , whom God loveth , he dyeth young . certain it is , that when God cuts off any righteous ones betimes , or permits them to be cut off by their bloody enemies , though these do it in malice , he suffers it in love . for ( Tell me ) is it not a mercy to be put into a safe harbour , before the stormy tempest arise ? To get into the house , before the thunder and lightning rain , and hail fall ? this is God's design in taking away his servants , and therefore they have reason to bid death welcome . indeed , the strongest consolation against death , is the consideration of the terminus ad quem , to what the righteous are taken , even that good , and bliss , and glory to come . they are taken to an innumerable company of angels , to the spirits of the just men made perfect . they are taken to a palace of glory ; a paradise of pleasure ; and a mansion of eternity . finally , they are taken to the beatifical vision of the face of God , and the full fruition of his glorious presence . but withal it is comfortable to reflect on the terminus a quo , from what they are taken , from the evil , misery , and calamity to come , upon the place where , and persons among whom they lived . 

2.  terror to the wicked . nothing more usual with ungodly men , then to rejoice when the righteous are taken away from among them . They had rather have their room then their company ; as being desirous to be rid of them . Hence it is , that they are not only glad of , but many times very active in taking away the righteous . they do not account themselves safe whilst the godly are among them but oh what fools are they , and how grossly deceived ! Rejoice not against me , oh mine enemy , saith the church . so May every son of the church . Little cause have the wicked to rejoice : nay , instead of laughing they have more cause to weep , when the righteous are taken away . for if the righteous be taken away from , it must needs follow that their taking away , is a sign of evil to come . so that the death of the godly , is a sad prognostic of the destruction of the wicked . what a wall is to a town , an hedge to a field , a pillar to an house , that is a righteous man to the place where he liveth . And therefore as men , when they intend to take the town , batter the walls ; to lay waste the field , pluck up the hedge ; to pull down the house , take away the pillar : so almighty God , when he designeth to pluck up , to overthrow , and to pull down a kingdom or a nation , he first removeth his own servants . Wicked men look upon the good , as thorns and pricks to offend them , whilst they have more cause to account them as chariots and horsemen to defend them . They think themselves most secure and happy , but indeed they are then nearest to misery and ruin , when the godly are taken from them . By taking away the righteous , they intend a courtesy to themselves , but it is in truth , as a courtesy to the good ; so an injury to themselves : though yet such is the blindness of their minds , they will not see ; and the hardness of their hearts , that they will not consider it . Which leads me to the 

other part of the text , the complaint which the prophet taketh up against the wicked in these words , no man layeth it to heart , none considering . 

It Might be here taken notice of in general , that the sin which the prophet declaimeth against , is not positive but negative . not the bloody taking away of righteous ones ; not the cruel rejoicing at their fall , but the not laying it to heart . indeed , to be an instrument of , or laugh at the calamity of the godly , making their tears our wine , their ruin our sport , is abominable . but though we be not in the seat of the scorners , yet if we be not in the posture of mourners , it is justly culpable . thus dives is charged by our blessed saviour , not with oppressing Lazarus , by taking any thing from him , but not relieving him ; in giving something to him . there are sins of omission as well as commission . there are breaches of the negative as well as of the afffirmative precepts . We sin as well ( Though not so much ) in not doing the good required , as in doing the evil prohibited . not only the wasteful steward , but the unprofitable servant , shall be cast out . the vine that bringeth forth no grapes , shall be cut down as well as that which bringeth forth wild grapes . those whom Christ will at the last day set at his left hand , are not accused with any evil or unjust acts they did , but only with neglect of those charitable acts they ought to have done . oh , let us make conscience of not doing , as well as doing . 

To let this go , the sin in particular reproved , is , not laying to heart , and considering the death of the righteous : concerning which i shall briefly discover three things ; the nature , the extent , and the guilt of it . 

1.  the nature of the sin , what it is , will the better appear , if we observe the emphasis of the words ; the one whereof considering , is an act of the judgement , weighing things in the balance of reason : the other , laying to heart , refers to the affections , since then any thing is laid to heart , when we are deeply affected with it . These do one infer the other ; since what we affect , we take into consideration , and by considering , we come to be affected . Whilst i was musing , the fire kindled , saith David . the consideration of any object , causeth suitable affections ; if delightful , joy , if hurtful , sorrow , the fault then here characterised , is , that though the righteous were taken away before their eyes , yet they did not lay it to their hearts . and though they could not but take notice , yet they would not consider it ; at leastwise not so seriously and affectionately as they ought 

2.  The extent of this sin , will be the more evident , if we observe the several circumstances by which it is aggravated . 

1.  It was not the death of any , but a righteous man ; not of one , but of many merciful men : and some of those , men of God , and yet it was not laid to heart . 

2.  These righteous and merciful ones , did not die a natural death , but were taken away , when yet they Might have lived ( In course of nature ) many years longer ; and done a great deal of service for God in their generation . and yet this was not laid to heart by them . 

3.  This taking away the righteous by death , did portend no less than ruin and misery to come , and that upon themselves : and yet they were so stupid as not to consider it . 

4.  And which enlargeth the complaint , their fault was general : none considered , none laid to heart . that is very few , as elsewhere ; there is none righteous . by which phrase is intimated , though not a nullity , yet a paucity ; not one of many were sensible of the loss , a spiritual lethargy had seized upon the most , and the disease was become epidemical . 

3.  The gild of this sin , how great it is , will be manifest in a threefold respect . 

1.  In regard of God , it argueth want of piety . Almighty God hath placed us in this world , as upon a theatre , that we Might take notice of the various passages of his providence . so that not to regard his works and consider the operation of his hands , cannot but highly provoke him . Indeed , they are equally bad , not to regard the sounding of his word in our ears , and not to observe the appearances of his works in our eyes . among his many providential works , none more observable than the taking away of the merciful . for certainly , if a sparrow fall not to the ground , much less doth a saint , without divine permission . if the hairs of his head are numbered , surely his head cannot be taken off , without a special providence . indeed , the perishing of a righteous man , is a work at once , both of God's mercy and judgement . Mercy to him , judgement to the wicked . and not to consider such a work , so as to lay it to heart , must needs be a great sin against him . 

2.  In regard of the righteous , it argueth want of pity . To him that is afflicted ( Saith Job ) pity should be showed from a friend ; and especially to him that is persecuted to the death . we May observe among beasts , ( Even swine ) a sympathy ; so that when one is killed , the rest are troubled : and shall there not be among men ? Didicimus cum homines simus alienis calamitatibus moveri , nothing more human , then to be moved with compassion towards them that are under sufferings . so that it is not only impiety , but inhumanity . 

3.  In regard of the persons themselves , it argueth want of wisdom . when the righteous perish , and merciful men are taken away , it is a loss to them who remain . they loose the light of their good example , the benefit of their prayers . and should not this be considered ? nay , it is not only a loss , but ( As hath been already expressed ) it is a doleful presage of ruin : and shall it not be laid to heart ? so that it argueth a senseless stupidity not to consider what is so much our own concernment . by all which it appeareth an impious , an inhuman , and unnatural sin which our prophet bemoaneth , when he saith , the righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart , and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come . 

Oh then , be we all exhorted to the contrary duty . Solomon the wise , seemeth to promise himself , that when the living are in the house of mourning , they will lay it to heart . and if we ought to lay to heart the death of any , much more of righteous men : and especially , when either Josiah the King , or Eliah the prophet , or Zacharias the priest , are taken from us . Though the sun is not much observed by us whilst it shineth , yet if it be in an eclipse , who doth not take notice of it ? Oh , let not the eclipse , and much less the setting of any of God's eminent servants pass by unregarded ! let us then consider and lay to heart the death of the righteous , 

1.  recordando , by keeping a register of the death of the godly in all ages , but chiefly in the age wherein we live ; both as to the quality of the persons , and the manner of their death . 

2.  lamentando , by bewailing their removal from us : not in respect of them , to whom death is a favour , but in regard of our selves , who May in their departure , sadly foretell approaching misery . 

3.  imitando , by following the good example both of their life and death , so far as we are called to it . By which means , their death will not only be their gain , but ours . 

4.  Preparando , by fitting our selves for that evil which their death foretells , that whilst the simple pass on and are punished , we May like prudent men fore see the evil , and hide ourselves : or rather God May hide us , either by preserving us in it , or by taking us away ( As he hath other of his servants ) before the vengeance come . 

And now ( beloved ) least i and you should be guilty of the sin , against which my text declaimeth , give me leave in a few words to put you in mind of the death of that righteous and merciful man of God , who hath been lately taken from us . 

titles , which i hope none will envy him , since if we look no further than his death , we shall find just occasion of applying them to him . As for the cause of his death , it concerneth not me to meddle with it ; i shall leave the censure of it to that day , when all the judgement of men shall be scanned over . But i trust none will be offended , if i take notice of the manner of his death ; the righteous ( Saith Solomon ) is as bold as a lion . and again , the righteous hath hope in his death . and surely , it was the confidence of a well led life , that made him so meekly bold , humbly confident at his death ; the righteousness of his way , which filled him with cheerfulness at his end . of all acts of mercy , none greater than the remitting injuries , and forgiving enemies : and how great a measure he had of this grace , those charitable lines which were read at his funeral , and the sweet words he uttered on the scaffold , abundantly testify . i want both time and tongue , to give you a narrative of his life , which was a constellation of many bright stars , many excellent graces which were obvious to all that knew him throughout the whole course of his conversation . this righteous and merciful man is now perished from the earth , and taken away from us ; but so , as that i have good reason to believe he is removed to that place of bliss , where he enjoyeth the society of saints and angels ; yea , of God himself . 

And now ( beloved ) let it not be said , out of sight out of mind . we can no longer enjoy him , but ( I hope ) we shall not forget him ; especially not you ( My brethren ) among whom he hath spent his pains , and exhausted his strength , to do your souls good . 

Do you ( I beseech you ) consider and remember how often you have beheld him in this holy mount : how many wholesome reproofs , counsels , and comforts you have heard from him , and withal reflect upon your own unthankfulness for , unprofitableness under his and the labours of others of God's faithful servants among you . Finally , do you , and let us all seriously lay to heart what a sad presage the death of this good man is of ruin and destruction , whilst me thinketh he saith to us this day in the words of his saviour , weep not for me ( i am taken away from the evil to come ) but weep for yourselves , upon whom evil is likely to come , unless by your real and speedy repentance you prevent it . and now i am come to the end of my sermon , and that which was my end in preaching it ; to stir up both my self and you to consider the death of this righteous man : not so , as to be imbittered against the instrument by whom it hath been effected , but against our selves for our sins which have procured it ; that this doleful loss May be an occasion of our sorrowful repentance , and that repentance May prevail with God to avert those judgements which hang over us , to continue his faithful labourers among us , and restore his ancient blessings to us ; which God grant for his mercy's sake in Jesus Christ . amen .
