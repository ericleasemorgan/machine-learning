THE MISTRESS , OR SEVERAL COPIES OF LOVE-VERSES . 

Written by Mr. A. Cowley , In his Youth , and now since his Death thought fit to be published . 

— Haeret lateri lethalis arundo . 


LONDON , Printed for Rowland Reynolds at the Sun and Bible in Postern-street near Moregate , 1667.  

To the Reader . 

A Correct Copy of these verses and ( as I am told ) written by the Author himself , falling into my hands , I thought fit to send to the Press ; chiefly because I hear that the same is like to be done from a more imperfect one . It is not my good fortune to be acquainted with the Author any further than his fame ( by which he is well known to all Englishmen ) and to that I am sure I shall do a service by this Publication : Not doubting but that , if these verses please his Mistress but half so well , as they will generally do the rest the world , he will be so well contented , as to forgive at least this my boldness , which proceeds only from my Love of Him , who will gain reputation , and of my Country , which will receive delight from it . I shall use no more preface , nor 〈◊〉 one word ( besides these few lines ) to the Book ; but faithfully and nakedly transmit it to thy view , just as it came to mine , unless perhaps some Typographicall faults get into it , which I will take care shall be as few as may be , and desire a pardon for them if there be any . 

Farewell . 

THE MISTRESS , OR SEVERAL COPIES OF LOVE VERSES . 

The Request . 

1.  

I ' Have often wished to love ; what shall I do ? 
Me still the cruel Boy does spare ; 
And a double task must bear , 
First to woo him , & then a Mistress too , 
Come at last and strike for shame ; 
If thou art any thing besides a name . 
I 'll think Thee else no God to be ; 
But Poets rather Gods , who first created Thee . 
2.  

I ask not one in whom all beauties flow , 
Let me but love , what ere she be , 
She cannot seem deformed to me ; 
And I would have her seem to others so . 
Desire takes wings and straight does fly , 
It stays not dully to inquire the why 
When I 'm that thing a Lover grown . 
I shall not see with others Eyes , scarce with mine own . 
3.  

If she be coy and scorn my noble fire , 
If her i'll heart I cannot move , 
Why I 'll enjoy the very Love , 
And make a Mistress of mine own Desire . 
Flames their most vigorous heat do hold , 
And purest light , if compassed round with cold : 
So when sharp Winter means most harm , 
The spring Plants are by the Snow itself kept warm . 
4.  

But do not touch my heart , and so be gone ; 
Strike deep thy burning arrows in : 
Lukewarmnesse I accounted a sin 
As great in Love , as in Religion . 
Come armed with flames , for I would prove 
All the extremities of mighty Love. 
th' excess of heat is but a fable ; 
We know the torrid Zone is now found habitable . 
5.  

Among the Woods and Forests thou art found , 
There Boars and Lions thou dost tame ; 
Is not my heart a noble game ? 
Let Venus Men , and Beasts Diana wound . 
thou dost the Birds thy Subjects make ; 
Thy nimble feathers do their wings o'ertake : 
At every spring they chant thy praise ; 
Make me but love like them , I 'll sing thee better lays . 
6.  

What service can mute fishes do to Thee ? 
Yet against them by Dart prevails , 
Piercing the armour of their Scales ; 
And still thy seaborn Mother life's i'th'sea : 
Dost thou deny only to me 
The no-great privilege of Captivity ? 
I beg or challenge here thy Bow ; 
Either thy pity to me , or else thine anger show . 
7.  

Come ; or I 'll teach the world to scorn that Bow : 
I 'll teach them thousand wholesome arts 
Both to resist and cure thy darts , 
more than thy skilful Ovid ere did know . 
Music of sighs thou shalt not hear , 
Nor drink no more on wretched Lovers Tear : 
Nay , unless soon thou woundest me , 
My Verses shall not only wound , but murder Thee . 
The Thraldom . 

1.  

I Came , I saw , and was undone ; 
The Lightning through my bones & marrow run ; 
A pointed pain pierced deep my heart ; 
A swift , cold trembling seized on every part ; 
My head turned round , nor could it bear 
The Poison that was entered there . 
2.  

So a destroying Angels breath 
Blows in the Plague , and with it hasty Death . 
Such was the pain , did so begin 
To the poor wretch , when Legion entered in . 
Forgive me , God , I cried ; for I 
Flattered myself I was to die . 
3.  

But quickly to my Cost I found , 
'T was cruel Love not Death had made the wound . 
Death a more generous rage does use ; 
Quarter to all he conquers does refuse . 
Whilst Love with barbarous mercy saves 
The vanquished lives to make them slaves . 
4 : 

I am thy slave then ; let me know , 
Hard Master , the great ask I have to do : 
Who pride and scorn do undergo , 
In tempests and rough Seas thy Galleys row ; 
Thy part , and groan , and sigh , but find 
Thy sighs increase the angry wind . 
5.  

Like an Egyptian Tyrant , some 
thou weariest out , in building but a Tomb . 
Others with sad , and tedious art 
Labour i' the Quarries of a stony Heart ; 
Of all the works thou dost assign 
To all the several slaves of thine , 
Employ me , mighty Love , to dig the Mine . 
The Given Lover . 

1 : 

I 'll on ; for what should hinder me 
From Loving , and Enjoying Thee ? 
thou canst not those exceptions make , 
Which thin-sould , under-mortalls take ; 
That my fate 's too mean and low ; 
'T were pity I should love thee so , 
If that dull cause could hinder me 
In Loving , and Enjoying thee . 
2.  

It does not me a whit displease , 
That the rich all honours seize ; 
That you all Titles make your own , 
Are Valiant , Learned , Wise alone . 
But if you claim o'er Women too 
The power which over men ye do ; 
If you alone must Lovers be ; 
For that , Sirs , you must pardon me . 
3.  

Rather than lose what does so near 
Concern my Life , and Being here , 
I 'll some such crooked ways invent , 
As you , or your Forefathers went : 
I 'll flatter or oppose the King , 
Turn Puritan , or Any thing ; 
I 'll force my Mind to arts so new : 
Grow Rich , and Love as well as You.  
4.  

But rather thus let me remain , 
As Man in Paradise did reign ; 
When perfect Love did so agree 
With Innocence and Poverty . 
Adam did no Jointure give , 
Himself was Jointure to his Eve : 
Untouched with Av'arice yet or Pride , 
The Rib came freely back to ' his side . 
5.  

A curse upon the man who taught 
Women , that Love was to be bought ; 
Rather dote only on your Gold , 
And that with greedy av'arice hold ; 
For if Woman too submit 
To that , and sell herself for it , 
Fond Lover , you a Mistress have 
Of her , that 's but your Fellow slave . 
6.  

What should those Poets mean of old 
That made their God to woo in God ? 
Of all men sure They had no cause 
To bind Love to such costly Laws ; 
And yet I scarcely blame them now ; 
For who , alas , would not allow , 
That Women should such gifts receive , 
could They themselves Be what They give . 
7.  

If thou , my Dear , Thyself shouldst prise , 
Alas , what value would suffice ? 
The Spaniard could not do 't , though he 
Should to both indies jointure thee . 
Thy beauties therefore wrong will take , 
If thou shouldst any bargain make , 
To give All will befit thee well ; 
But not at Under-rates to sell.  
8.  

Bestow thy Beauty then on me , 
Freely , as Nature gave 't to Thee ; 
't is an exploded Popish thought 
To think that Heaven may be bought . 
Prayers , Hymns , & Praises are the way ; 
And those my thankful Muse shall pay ; 
The Body in my verse enshrined , 
Shall grow immortal as thy Mind . 
9  

I 'll fix thy title next in fame 
To Sacharissas' well-sung name . 
So faithfully will I declare 
What all thy wondrous beauties are , 
That when at the last great Assize 
All Women shall together rise , 
Men straight shall cast their eyes on Thee , 
And know at first that thou art She . 
The Spring . 

1.  

Though you be absent here , I needs must say , 
The Trees as beauteous are , and flowers as gay , 
As ever they were wont to be ; 
Nay the Birds rural music too 
Is as Melodious and free , 
As if they sung to pleasure you : 
I saw a Rose But o'pe this morn ; I 'll swear 
The blushing Morning oped not more fair . 
2.  

How could it be so fair , and you away ? 
How could the Trees be beauteous , Flowers so gay ? 
could they remember but last year , 
How you did Them , They you delight , 
The sprouting leaves which saw you here , 
And called their Fellows to the sight , 
Would , looking round for the same sight in vain , 
Creep back into their silent Barks again . 
3.  

Where ere you walked , trees were as reverend made , 
As when of old Gods dwelled in every shade . 
Is 't possible they should not know , 
What loss of honour they sustain , 
That thus they smile and flourish now , 
And still their former pride retain ? 
Dull creatures ! 't is not without cause that she , 
Who fled the God of wit , was made a Tree . 
4.  

In ancient times sure they much wiser were , 
When they rejoiced the Thracian verse to hear ; 
In vain did nature bid them stay 
When Orpheus had his song begun , 
They called their wondering roots away 
And bade them silent to him run . 
How would those learned trees have followed you ? 
You would have drawn Them , and their Poet too . 
5.  

But who can blame them now ? for , since you 're gone , 
They are here the only Fair , and Shine alone . 
You did their Natural Rights invade ; 
Where ever you did walk or sit , 
The thickest Bows could make no shade , 
Although the Sun had granted it : 
The fairest Flowers could please no more , near you , 
then Painted flowers , set next to them , could do . 
6.  

When ever then you come hither , that shall be 
The time , which this to others is , to Me . 
The little joys which here are now 
The name of Punishments do bear ; 
When by their sight they let us Know 
How we deprived of greater are . 
't is you the best of Seasons with you bring ; 
This is for Beasts , and that for Men the Spring . 
Written in juice of Lemon . 

1.  

Whilst what I write I do not see , 
I dare thus eve to you write Poetry . 
Ah foolish muse , which dost so high aspire , 
And knowest her judgement well 
How much it does thy power excel , 
Yet dar'st be ready by , thy just doom , the Fire . 
2.  

Alas , thou thinkest thyself secure , 
Because thy form is Innocent and Pure : 
Like Hypocrites , which seem unspotted here ; 
But when they sadly come to die , 
And the last Fire their Truth must try , 
Scrauld o'er like thee , and blotted they appear . 
3.  

Go then , but reverently go , 
And , since thou needs must sin , confess it too : 
Confess 't , and with humility cloth thy shame ; 
For thou , who else must burned be 
An Heretic , if she pardon thee , 
Maysed like a Martyr then enjoy the Flame . 
4.  

But if her wisdom grow severe , 
And suffer not her goodness to be there ; 
If her large mercies cruelly it restrain ; 
Be not discouraged , but require 
A more gentle Ordeall Fire , 
And bid her by Love's Flames read it again . 
5.  

Strange power of heat , thou yet dost show 
Like winter earth , naked , or clothed with snow , 
But , as the quickening sun approaching near , 
The Planets arise up by degrees , 
A sudden paint adorns the trees 
And all kind Nature's Characters appear . 
6.  

So , nothing yet in Thee is seen , 
But soon as Genial heat warms thee within , 
A newborn Wood of various Lines there grows ; 
Here but an A , and there a B , 
Hear sprouts a V , and there a T , 
And all the flourishing Letters stand in Rows . 
7.  

Still , silly Paper , thou wilt think 
That all this might as well be written with Ink . 
O no ; there 's sense in this , and Mystery ; 
thou now must change thy Author's name , 
And to Hand lay noble claim ; 
For as She Reads , she Makes the words in Thee . 
8.  

Yet if thine own unworthiness 
Will still , that thou art mine , not Hers , confess ; 
Consume thyself with Fire before her Eyes , 
And so her Grace and Pity move ; 
The Gods , though Beasts they do not Love , 
Yet like them when they 're burned in Sacrifice . 
Inconstancy . 

Five years ago ( says story ) I loved you , 
For which you call me most inconstant now ; 
Pardon me , Madam , you mistake the man ; 
For I am not the same that I was than ; 
no Flesh is now the same 't was then in me , 
And that my mind is changed yourself may see . 
The same Thoughts to retain still , and Intents 
Were more inconstant far ; for Accidents 
Must of all things most strangely Inconstant prove , 
If from one Subject they t'another move ; 
My Members then , the Father Members were 
From whence These take their birth , which now are here . 
If then this Body love what th' other did , 
'T were Incest , which by Nature is forbid . 
You might as well this Day inconstant name , 
Because the Wether is not still the same , 
That it was yesterday , or blame the Year , 
'Cause the Spring Flowers , and Autumn fruit does bear . 
The world 's a Scene of Changes , and to be 
Constant , in Nature were Inconstancy : 
For 't were to break the Laws herself has made , 
Our Substances themselves do fleet , and fade ; 
The most fixed Being , still doth move and fly , 
Swift as the Wings of time 't is measured by . 
T' imagine then that Love will never cease 
( Love which is but the Ornament of these ) 
Were quite as senseless , as to wonder why 
Beauty and Colour stays not when we die . 
Not Fair . 

't is very true , I thought you once as fair , 
As women in the Idea are . 
What ever here seems beauteous , seemed to be 
But a faint Metaphor of Thee . 
But then ( me thoughts ) there something shined within , 
Which cast this Lustre o'er thy skin . 
Nor could I choose but count it the Sun's Light , 
Which made this Cloud appear so bright . 
But since I knew thy falsehood and thy pride , 
And all thy thousand faults beside : 
A very Moor ( me thinks ) placed near to Thee , 
White as his Teeth would seem to be . 
So men ( they say ) by hell's delusion led , 
Have ta'en a Succubus to their bed : 
Believe it fair , and themselves happy call , 
Till the cleft Foot discovers all : 
then they start from 't , half Ghosts themselves with fear ; 
And Devil as , 't is , it does appear . 
So since against my will I found Thee foul , 
Deformed and crooked in thy Soul , 
My Reason straight did to my Senses show , 
That they might be mistaken too : 
Nay when the world but knows how false you are , 
there 's not a man will think you fair . 
Thy shape will monstrous in their fancies be , 
they 'll call their Eyes as false as Thee . 
Be what thou wilt ; hate will present thee so , 
As Puritans do the Pope , and Papists Luther do . 
Platonic love . 

1.  

Indeed I must confess , 
When Souls mix 't is an happiness : 
But not complete till Bodies too do join , 
And both our Wholes into one Whole combine : 
But half of Heaven the Souls in glory taste , 
Till by Love in Heaven at last , 
Their Bodies too are placed . 
2.  

In thy immortal part 
Man , as well as I thou art . 
But something 't is that differs Thee and Me : 
And we must one even in that difference be . 
ay Thee , both as a man , and woman prize : 
For a perfect Love implies 
Love in all Capacities . 
3.  

Can that for true love pass , 
When a fair woman court's her glass ? 
Something unlike must in Love's likeness be , 
His wonder is , one and Variety . 
For he , whose soul naught but a Soul can move , 
Does a new Narcissus prove , 
And his own Image love . 
4.  

That souls do beauty know , 
't is to the Bodies help they owe ; 
If when they owed they straight abuse that trust , 
And shut the Body from 't , 't is as unjust , 
As if I brought my dearest friend to see 
My Mistress , and at th' instant He 
Should steal her quite from Me.  
The Change.  

1.  

Love in her sunny Eyes does basking play ; 
Love walks the pleasant Mazes of her Hair , 
Love does on both her Lips for ever stray ; 
And sows and reaps a thousand kisses there . 
In all her outward parts love 's always seen : 
But , o , He never went within . 
2.  

Within Love's foes , his greatest foes abide 
Malice , Inconstancy , and Pride . 
So the Earth's face , Trees , Herbs , and Flowers do dress 
With other beauties numberless : 
But at the Centre , Darkness is , and Hell ; 
There wicked Spirits , and there the Damned dwell . 
3.  

With me alas quite contrary it fares ; 
Darkness and Death lies in my weeping eyes , 
Despair and Paleness in my face appears , 
And Grief and Fear Love's greatest enemies ; 
But , like the Persian Tyrant , Love within 
Keeps his proud Court and never is seeen . 
4.  

O take my Heart , and by what means you 'll prove 
Within too stored enough of Love : 
Give me but Yours , I 'll by that change so thrive , 
That Love in all my parts shall live . 
So powerful is this Change , it tender can 
My outside Woman , and your inside Man  
Clad all in White . 

1.  

Fairest thing that shines below , 
Why in this robe dost thou appear ? 
Wouldst thou a white most perfect show , 
thou must at all no garment wear : 
thou wilt seem much whiter so , 
then Winter when 't is clad with Snow . 
2.  

't is not the Linen shows so fair : 
Her skin shines through , and makes it bright ; 
So Clouds themselves like Suns appear , 
When the Sun pierces them with Light. 
So Lilies in a glass enclose , 
The Glass will seem as white as those . 
3.  

thou now one heap of beauty art , 
Naught outwards , or within is foul ; 
Condensed beams make every part : 
Thy body 's clothed like thy Soul . 
Thy soul which does itself display , 
Like a star placed i' th' the Milky way . 
4.  

Such robes the Saints departed wear , 
Wooven all with Light divine ; 
Such their exalted Bodies are , 
And with such full glory shine . 
But o , they ' tend not mortals pain : 
Men pray , I fear , to both in vain . 
5.  

Yet seeing thee so gently pure , 
My hopes will needs continue still ; 
thou wouldst not take this garment sure , 
When thou hadst an intent to kill . 
Of Peace and yielding who would doubt , 
When the White Flags he sees hung out ? 
Leaving Me , and then loving many . 

SO Men who once have cast the truth away , 
Forsaken by God , do strange wild lusts obey ; 
So the vain Gentiles , when they left t' adore 
One Deity , could not stop at thousands more . 
Their zeal was senseless strait , and boundless grown : 
They worshipped many a Beast , and many a Stone . 
Ah fair Apostate ! couldst thou think to flee 
From Truth and Goodness , yet keep Unity ? 
I reigned alone , and my blessed Self could call 
The Universal Monarch of her All. 
Mine , mine her fair East-indieses were above , 
Where those Suns rise that cheer the world of Love ; 
Where Beauties shine like gems of richest price : 
Where Coral grows , and every breath is spice : 
Mine too her rich West-indieses were below , 
Where mines of gold and treasures grow . 
But as , when the Pellaean Conqueror died , 
Many small Princes did his Crown divide , 
So since my Love has vanquished world forsaken , 
Murdered by poisons from her falsehoods took , 
An hundred petty Kings claim each their part , 
And rend that glorious Empire of her Heart . 
My Heart discovered . 

Her body is so gently bright , 
Clear , and transparent to the sight , 
( Clear as fair Crystal to the view , 
Yet soft as that , ere Stone it grew ; ) 
That through her flesh , me thinks , is seen 
The brightest Soul that dwells within : 
Our eyes through th' radiant covering pass , 
And see that Lily through its Glass . 
I through her Breast , her Heart espy , 
As Souls in hearts do Souls descry . 
I see 't with gentle Motions beaten ; 
I see light in 't but find no heat . 
Within like Angels in the sky , 
A thousand gilded thoughts do fly : 
Thoughts of bright and noblest kind , 
Fair and chaste , as Mother Mind . 
But o , what other heart is there , 
Which sighs and crowds to hers so near ? 
't is all on flame , and does like fire 
To that , as to its Heaven aspire . 
The wounds are many in 't and deep ; 
Still does it bleed , and still does weep , 
Whose ever wretched Heart it be , 
I cannot choose but grieve to see : 
What pity in my Breast does reign ? 
Me thinks I feel all its pain . 
So torn and so defaced it lies , 
That it could neera be known by th' eyes : 
But , O , at last I heard it groan , 
And knew by th'voice that 't was mine own : 
So poor Alcione , when she saw 
A shipwrecked body to'wards her draw 
Beaten by the waves , let fall a Tear , 
Which only then did Pity wear : 
But when the Corpse on shore were cast , 
Which she her husband found at last : 
What should the wretched widow do ? 
Grief changed her straight , away she flew , 
Turned to a Bird : and so at last shall I 
Both from my Murdered Heart , and Murderer fly . 
Answer to the Platonics . 

SO Angels love , so let them for me ; 
When I 'm all Soul , such shall my Love too be : 
Who nothing here but like a Spirit would do , 
In a short time beleeve'twill be one too , 
But'shal our Love do what in Beasts we see ? 
Even Beasts eat too , but not so well as We. 
And you as justly might in thirst refuse , 
The use of Wine , because Beasts Water use , 
They taste those pleasures as they do their food ; 
Undressed tstey take 't , devour it raw and crude : 
But to us men , Love cooks it at his fire , 
And adds the poignant sauce of sharp desire , 
Beasts do the same , 't is true : but ancient fame 
Says , Gods themselves turned Beasts to do the same . 
The Thunderer , , who , without the female bed , 
could Goddesses bring forth from out his head , 
Choose rather Mortals this way to create ; 
So much he ' steemd his pleasure , above his state . 
ye talk of fires which shine , but never burn ; 
In this cold world they 'll hardly serve our turn : 
As useless despairing Lovers grown , 
As Lambent flames , to men i' th' Frigid Zone . 
The Sun does his pure fires on earth bestow 
With Nuptial warmth , to bring forth things below ; 
Such is Love's noblest and divinest heat , 
That warms like his , and does like his beget . 
Lust you call this , a name to yours most just , 
If an inordinate Desire be Lust : 
Pygmalion , loving what none can enjoy , 
more lustful was , than the hot youth of Troy.  
The vain Love. Loving one first because she could love no body , Afterwards loving her with desire . 

What newfound Witchcraft was in thee , 
With thine own Cold to kindle Me ? 
Strange art ! like him that should device 
To make a Burning-glasse of Ice : 
When winter so the Plants would harm , 
Her snow itself does keep them warm : 
Fool that I was ! who having found 
A rich and Sunny Diamond , 
Admired the hardness of the Stone : 
But not the light with which it shone : 
Your brave and haughty scorn of all 
Was stately , and Monarchical . 
All Gentleness with that esteemed 
A dull and slavish virtue seemed : 
Should you have yielded then to me , 
You'had lost what av-s_d I loved in thee : 
For who would serve one , whom he sees 
That he can Conquer if he please ▪ 
It fared with me , as if a slave 
In Triumph lead , that does perceive 
With what a gay Majestic pride 
His Conqueror through the streets does ride ▪ 
Should be contented with his woe , 
Which makes up such a comely show . 
I sought not from thee a return , 
But without Hopes or Fears did burn : 
My covetous Passion did approve 
The Hoarding up , not Use of Love. 
My Love a kind of Dream was grown , 
A Foolish but a Pleasant one : 
From which I 'm wakened now , but o , 
Prisoners to die are wakened so . 
For now my Fires and Wishes are 
Nothing but longings with Despair . 
Despair , whose torments no men sure 
But Lovers and the Damned endure . 
Her scorn I doted once upon , 
Ill object for Affection . 
But since , alas , too much 't is proved 
That yet 't was something that I loved : 
Now my desires are worse and flee 
At an Impossibility : 
Desires , which whilst so high they soar , 
Are proud as that I loved before . 
What lover can like me complain , 
Who first loved vainly , next in vain ? 
The Soul . 

1.  

IF mine Eyes do ere declare 
They'have seen a second thing that 's fair : 
Or Ears that they have Music found , 
Besides thy Voice in any Sound ; 
If my taste do ever meet , 
After thy Kiss with aught that 's sweet ; 
If my abused Touch allow , 
Aught to be smooth , or soft but You : 
If , what seasonable Springs , 
Or the Eastern Summer brings , 
Do my Smell persuade at all 
Aught Perfume ; but thy Breath to call : 
If all my senses Objects be 
Not contracted into Thee , 
And so through Thee more powerful pass , 
As Beams do through a Burning Glass : 
If all things that in Nature are 
Either soft , or sweet , or fair , 
Are not in thee so Epitomised , 
May I as worthless seem to Thee 
As all , but thou , appears to Me . 
2.  

If I ever Anger know 
Till some wrong be done to You ; 
If Gods or Kings my Envy move , 
Without their Crowns crowned by thy Love ; 
If ever I an hope admit , 
Without thy Image stamped on it : 
Or any fear till I begin 
To find that you 're concerned therein ; 
If a Joy ere come to Me , 
That tastes of any thing but Thee : 
If any Sorrow touch my Mind , 
Whilst You are well and not unkind : 
If I a minute's space debate , 
Whether I shall curse and hate : 
The things beneath thy hatred fall , 
Though ●ll the World Myself and all : 
And for Love ; if ever I 
Appear to it again so nigh , 
As to allow a Toleration 
To the least glimmering Inclination ; 
If thou alone do not control 
All those Tyrants of my Soul , 
And to thy Beauties tiest them so , 
That constant they as Habits grow ; 
If any Passion of my Heart , 
By any force , or any art , 
Be brought to move one step from Thee , 
Mayst thou no Passion have for Me . 
3.  

If my busy Imagination 
Do not Thee in all things fashion : 
So that all Fair Species be 
Hyeroglyphick marks of Thee ; 
If when She her sports does keep , 
( The lower Soul being all asleep ) 
She play one Dream with all her art 
Where thou hast not the longest part . 
If ought get place in my Remembrance 
Without some badge of thy resemblance , 
So that thy parts become to me 
A kind of Art of Memory : 
If my Understanding do 
Seek any Knowledge but of You 
If she do near thy Body prise 
Her Bodies of Philosophies , 
If She to the Will do show 
Aught desirable but You , 
Or if That would not rebel , 
Should she another Doctrine tell : 
If my Will do not resign 
All her Liberty to thine ; 
If she would not follow Thee , 
Though Fate and thou shouldst disagree : 
And if ( for I a curse will give , 
Such as shall force thee to believe ) 
My soul be not entirely thine , 
May thy dear Body never be Mine . 
The Passions . 

1.  

From Hate , Fear , Hope , Anger , and Envy free 
And all the Passions else that be , 
In vain I boast of Liberty , 
In vain this State a Freedom call : 
Since I have Love , and Love is all : 
Sot that I am , who think it fit to brag , 
That I have no Disease beside the Plague ▪ 
2.  

So in a zeal the Sons of Israel , 
Sometimes upon their Idols fell : 
And they deposed the powers of Hell , 
Baal , and Astarte down they threw , 
And Accaron , and Molock too ; 
All this imperfect Piety did no good , 
Whilst yet alas the Calf of Bethel stood . 
3.  

Fond I boast that I have dressed my Vine 
With painful Art , and that the wine 
Is of a taste rich and divine , 
Since love by mixing poison there , 
Has made it worse than vinegar . 
Love even the taste of Nectar changes so , 
That Gods choose rather water here below . 
4.  

Fear , Anger , hope , all passions else that be , 
Drive this one Tyrant out of Me. 
And practise all your Tyranny ; 
Thec hang of ils some good will do ; 
th' oppressed wretched Indians so , 
Being floves by the great Spanish Monarch made , 
Call in the States of Holland to their aid . 
Wisdom . 

't is mighty Wise that you would now be thought 
With your grave Rules from musty Morals brought , 
Through which some streaks too of Div'nity ran , 
Partly of Monk , and partly Puritan : 
With tedious Repetitions too   ta'en 
Often the name of Vanity in vain . 
Things which I take it , friend you'd ne'er recite , 
Should she I love , but say ye , Come at night . 
The wisest King refused all pleasures quite , 
Till Wisdom from above did him enlight : 
But when that gifts his ignorance did remove , 
Pleasures he choose and placed them all in Love ; 
And if by event the counsels may be seen , 
This wisdom 't was that brought the Southern Queen . 
She came not like a good old Wife to know 
The wholesome nature of all plants that grow : 
Nor did so far from her own Country room , 
To cure Scaled heads , and broken shins at home : 
She came for that which more befits all Wives , 
The art of Giving , not of Saving lives . 
The Despair . 

1.  

Beneath this gloomy shade , 
By Nature only for my sorrows made , 
I 'll spend this voice in cries , 
In tears I 'll waste these eyes 
By Love so vainly fed ; 
So Lust of old the Deluge punished . 
Ah wretched youth , said I ! 
Ah wretched youth ! twice did I sadly cry ; 
Ah wretched youth ! the fields and floods reply . 
2.  

When thoughts of Love I entertain , 
I meet no words , but Never , and In vain . 
Never ( alas ) that dreadful name , 
Which fewells the infernal flame : 
Never , my time to come must ●●st ; 
In vain , torment's the present and the past . 
In vain , in vain ! said I ▪ 
In vain , in vain ! twice did I sadly cry ; 
In vain , in vain , the fields and floods reply . 
3.  

no more shall fields or floods do so ; 
For I to shades more dark and silent go : 
All this world's noise appears to me 
A dull ill-acted Comedy : 
no comfort to my wounded sight 
In the Sun's busy and impert'nent Light. 
then down I laid my head ; 
Down on cold earth , and for a while was dead : 
And my freed Soul to a strange Somewhere fled . 
4.  

Ah sottish Soul , said I : 
When back t'o his Cage again I saw it fly : 
Fool to resume his broken chain ! 
And row his Calley here again ! 
Fool to that body to return , 
Where it condemned and destined is to burn ! 
Once dead , how can it be , 
Death should a thing so pleasant seem to Thee , 
That thou shouldst come to live it o'er again in Me ? 
The Wish . 

1.  

Well then , I now do plainly see , 
This busy world and I shall ne'er agree : 
The very honey of all earthly joy 
Does of all meats the soon cloy , 
And they me thinks deserve my pity , 
Who for it can endure the stings , 
The Crowd , and Buz , and murmurings 
Of this great Hive , the City . 
2.  

Ah , yet , ere I descend to th' grave 
May I a small House , and large Garden have ! 
And a few Friends , and many Books , both true , 
Both wise , and both delightful too ! 
And since Love near will from me flee , 
A Mistress moderately fair , 
And good as Guardian Angels are , 
Only beloved , and loving me . 
3.  

O , Founts ! O , when in you shall I 
Myself , eased of unpeacefull thoughts , espy ? 
O , Fields ! O , Woods ! when , shall I be made 
The happy Tenant of your shade ? 
here 's the spring head of Pleasure's flood : 
here 's wealth Natures Treasury , 
Where all the riches lie that she 
Has coined and stamped for good . 
4.  

Pride and Ambition here , 
Only in far fetched Metaphors appear : 
Here naught but winds can hurtful Murmurs scatter , 
And naught but echo flatter . 
The Gods when they descended , hither 
From heaven did always choose their way ; 
And therefore we may boldly say , 
That 't is the way too thither . 
5.  

How happy here should I , 
And one dear She , live , and embracing die ? 
She who is all ! the world , and can exclude 
In deserts solitude . 
I should then this only fear , 
lest men , when they my pleasures see , 
Should all come im'itate Me , 
And so make a City here . 
My Diet.  

1.  

Now by my Love , the greatest Oath that is , 
None love's you half so well as I : 
I do not ask your Love for this , 
But for heaven's sake believe me , or I die . 
no Servant ere , but did deserve 
His Master should believe that he does serve ; 
And I 'll ask no more wages , though I starve . 
2.  

't is no luxurious Diet this , and sure 
I shall not by 't to lusty prove ; 
Yet shall it willingly endure , 
if 't can but keep together Life and Love. 
Being your Prisoner and your slave 
I do not Feasts and Banquets look to have , 
A little Bread and water 's all I crave . 
3.  

O'n a sigh of Pity I a year can live , 
One Tear will keep me twenty at least , 
Fifty a gentle look will give ; 
An hundred years on one kind word I 'll feast : 
A thousand more will added be 
If you an Inclination have for Me : 
And all beyond is vast Eternity . 
The Thief . 

1.  

Thou robbest my Days of business and delights , 
Of sleep thou robbest my Nights : 
Ah lovely Thief , what wilt thou do ? 
What ? rob me of Heaven too ? 
Even in my prayers thou hauntest me ; 
And I , with wild Idolatry 
Begin to God , and end them all , to Thee . 
2.  

Is it a Sin to Love , that it should thus 
Like an ill Conscience torture us ? 
What ere I do , where ere I go , 
( None Guiltless ere was haunted so ) 
Still , still , me thinks thy face I view , 
And still thy shape does me pursue , 
As if , not you Me , but I had murdered You.  
3.  

From books I strive some remedy to take , 
But thy Name all the Letters make ; 
What ere 't is written , I find that there , 
Like Points and Commas every where ; 
Me blessed for this let no man hold , 
For I , as Midas did of old , 
Perish by turning every thing to Gold.  
4.  

What do I seek , alas , or what do I 
Attempt in vain from thee to fly ? 
For making thee my Deity 
I gave thee then Ubiquity . 
My pains resemble Hell in this ; 
The divine presence there too is , 
But to torment Men , not to give them bliss . 
All over , Love.  

1.  

't is well , 't is well with them ( say I ) 
Whose short lived Passions with themselves can die : 
For none can be unhappy , who 
' Midst all his ills a time does know 
( Though ne'er so long ) when he shall not be so . 
1.  

What ever parts of Me remain , 
Those parts will still the Love of Thee retain ; 
For 't was not only in my Heart , 
But like a God by powerful Art , 
'T was all in all , and all in every Part.  
3.  

My Affection no more perish can 
then the first Matter that compounds a Man 
Hereafter if one Dust of Me 
Mixed with another's Substance be , 
'T will Leavens that whole Lump with Love of Thee . 
4.  

Let Nature if she please disperse 
My Atoms over all the Universe , 
At the last they easily shall , 
Themselves know , and together call , 
For thy Love , like a Mark , is stamped on all . 
Love and Life . 

1.  

Now sure , within this twelvemonth passed 
I ' have loved at least some twenty years or more : 
The account of Love runs much more fast 
then that with which our Life does score : 
So though my Life be short , yet I may prove 
The great Methusalem of Love.  
2.  

Not that Love's Hours or Minutes are 
Shorter than those our Being's measured by : 
But they 're more close compacted far , 
And so in lesser room do lie . 
Thin airy things extend themselves in space , 
Things solid took up little place . 
3.  

Yet Love , alas , and Life in Me 
Are not two several things , but purely one , 
At once how can there in it be 
A double different Motion ? 
OH yes , there may : for so the self same Sun , 
At once does slow and swiftly run . 
4.  

Swiftly his daily course he goes , 
And walks his Annual with a statelier pace ; 
And does three hundred rounds enclose 
Within one yearly Circles space . 
5.  

When Soul does to myself refer , 
't is then my life , and does but slowly move ; 
But when it does relate to her , 
It swiftly fly's , and then is love . 
Love's my Diurnal course , divided right 
Betwixt Hope and Fear , my Day and Night . 
The Bargain . 

1.  

Take heed , take heed thou lovely Maid , 
Not be by glittering ills betrayed ; 
Thyself for Money ? o , let no man know 
The Price of beauty fallen so low ! 
What dangers oughtest thou not to dread , 
When Love that 's Blind , is by blind Fortune led ? 
2.  

The foolish Indian that sells 
His precious Gold for beads and bells , 
Does a more wise and gainful traffic hold , 
then thou who sell'st high self for gold . 
What gains in such a bargain are ? 
he 'll in thy mines dig better Treasures far . 
3.  

Can Gold , alas , with Thee compare ? 
The Sun that makes it 's not so fair ; 
The Sun which can nor make nor ever see 
A thing so beautiful as Thee 
In all the journeys he does pass , 
Though the Sea served him for a looking glass . 
4.  

Bold was the wretch that cheapened Thee , 
Since Magus none so bold as he , 
thou 'rt so divine a thing , that Thee to buy , 
Is to be counted Simony ; 
Too dear he 'll find his sordid price , 
Has forfeited that , and the Benefice . 
5.  

If it be lawful Thee to buy , 
there 's none can pay that rate but I : 
Nothing on earth a fitting price can be , 
But what on earth's most like to Thee . 
And that my Heart does only bear : 
For there Thyself , Thy very self is there . 
6.  

So much thyself does in me live , 
That when for it thyself I give , 
't is but to change that piece of Gold for this , 
Whose stamp and value equal is . 
Yet lest the weight be counted bad , 
My Soul and Body , two Grains more , I 'll add . 
The long Life . 

1.  

Love from Time's wings hath stolen the feathers sure , 
He has ; and put them to his own : 
For Hours of late as long as Days endure , 
And very Minute's Hours are grown . 
2.  

The various Motions of the turning Year , 
Belong not now at all to Me : 
Each Summers' Night does Lucy's now appear , 
Each Winter Day Saint Barnaby . 
3.  

How long a space since first I loved it is ? 
To look into a glass I fear ; 
And am surprised with wonder when I miss , 
Grey hairs and wrinkles there . 
4.  

th' old Patriarches age and not their happiness too 
Why does hard fate to us restore ? 
Why does Love's Fire thus to Mankind renew , 
What the Flood washed away before ? 
5.  

Sure those are happy people that complain , 
ON the shortness of the days of Man : 
Contract mine , Heaven , and bring them back again 
To th' ordinary Span.  
6.  

If when your gift , long Life , I disapprove , 
I too ingrateful seem to be ; 
Punish me justly , heaven : make Her to love , 
And then 't will be too short for Me . 
Council . 

1.  

Gently , ah gently , Madam touch 
The wound , which you yourself have made ; 
That pain must needs be very much , 
Which makes me of your hand afraid . 
Cordials of pity give me now , 
For I too weak for Purge grow . 
2.  

Do but a while with patience stay ; 
For Counsel yet will do no good , 
Till Time , and Rest , and Heaven allay , 
The vi'olent burnings of my blood , 
For what effect from this can flow , 
To chide men drunk , for being so ? 
3.  

Perhaps the Physic's good you give 
But ne'er to me can useful prove : 
Medicines may Cure , but not Revive ; 
And I 'm not Sick , but Dead in Love. 
In Love's Hell , not his World , am I ; 
At once I Live , am Dead , and Dy.  
4.  

What new found Rhetoric is thine ? 
Even thy Disswassions me persuade , 
And thy great power does clearest shine , 
When thy Commands are disobeyed . 
In vain thou bidst me to forbear ; 
Obedience were Rebellion here . 
5.  

Thy Tongue comes in as if it meant 
Against thine Eyes t' assist my Heart ; 
But different far was his intent : 
For straight the Traitor took their part . 
And by this new foe I 'm bereft 
Of all that Little which was left . 
6.  

The act I must confess was wise , 
As a dishonest act could be : 
Well knew the Tongue ( alas ) your Eyes 
Would be too strong for That , and Me . 
And part o' the Triumph choose to get , 
Rather than be a part of it . 
Resolved to be beloved . 

1.  

't is true , I have loved already three or four , 
And shall three or four hundred more : 
I 'll love each fair one that I see , 
Till I find one at last that shall love Me . 
2.  

That shall my Canaan be , the fatal soil , 
That ends my wander , and my toil . 
I 'll settle there and happy grow ; 
The Country does with Milk and Honey flow . 
3.  

The Needle trembles so , and turns about : 
Till it the Northern point find out : 
But constant then and fixed does prove , 
Fixed , that his dearest Pole as soon may move . 
4.  

then may my Vessel torn and shipwrecked be , 
If it put forth again to Sea : 
It never more abroad shall room , 
though 't could next voyage bring the indies home . 
5.  

But I must sweated in Love , and labour yet , 
Till I a Competency get . 
they 're slothful fools who leave a Trade , 
Till they a moderate Fortune by 't have made . 
6.  

Variety I ask not ; give me One 
To live perpetually upon . 
The person Love does to us fit , 
Like Manna , hath the Taste of all in it . 
The same . 

1.  

For Heaven's sake what do you mean to do ? 
Keep me or let me go , one of the two ; 
Youth and warm hours let me not idly lose , 
The little Time that Love does choose ; 
If always here I must not stay , 
Let me be gone whilst yet 't is day ; 
lest I faint and benighted loose my way . 
2.  

't is dismal , One so long to love 
In vain , till to love more as vain must prove : 
To hunt so long one nimble prey , till we 
Too weary to take others be ; 
Alas 't is folly to remain , 
And waste our Army thus in vain , 
Before a City , which will ne'er be ta'en . 
3.  

At several hopes wisely to fly , 
Aught not to be esteemed Inconstancy : 
't is more Inconstant always to pursue 
A thing that always flies from you ; 
For that at last may meet a bound , 
But no end can to this be found , 
't is naught but a perpetual fruitless Round . 
4.  

When it does Hardness meet and Pride , 
My Love does then rebound t'another side : 
But if it ought that 's soft and yielding hit ; 
It lodges there , and stays in it . 
What ever 't is shall first love me , 
That it my Heaven may truly be ; 
I shall be sure to give 't Eternity . 
The Discovery . 

1.  

BY Heaven I 'll tell her boldly that 't is She ; 
Why should She ashamed or angry be , 
To be beloved by Me ? 
The Gods may give their Altars o'er ; 
they 'll smoak but seldom any more , 
If none but Happy Men must them adore . 
2.  

The Lightning , which tall Oaks oppose in vain , 
To strike sometimes does not disdain , 
The humble Furzes of the Plain . 
She being so high , and I so low , 
Her power by this doth greater show , 
Who at such distance gives so sure a blow . 
3.  

Compared with her all things so worthless prove , 
That naught on earth can towards her move 
till 't be exalted by her Love. 
Equal to her , alas , there 's none ; 
She like a Deity is grown : 
That must create , or else must be alone . 
4.  

If there be man who thinks himself so high , 
As to pretend equality , 
He deserves her less , than I ; 
For he would cheat for his relief ; 
And one would give with lesser grief 
To an undeserving Beggar , than a Thief , 
Against Fruition . 

no ; thou 'rt a fool , I 'll swear , if ere thou grant : 
Much of my Veneration thou must want , 
Whence once thy kindness puts my Ignorance out 
For a learned Age is always least devout . 
Keep still thy distance ; for at once to me 
Goddess and Woman too , thou canst not be ; 
Thoured Queen of all that sees thee ; and as such 
Must neither Tyrannize , nor yield to much ; 
Such freedom give as may admit command , 
But keep the Forts , and Magazines in thine hand . 
thou 'rt yet a whole world to me , and dost fill 
My large ambition ; but 't is dangerous still , 
lest I like the Pellaean Prince should be , 
And weep for other world's hav'ng conquered thee ; 
When Love has taken all thou hast away , 
His strength by too much riches will decay . 
thou in my fancy dost much higher stand , 
then Women can be placed by Nature's hand ; 
And I must needs , I 'm sure , a loser be , 
To change Thee , as thou 'rt there , for very Thee . 
Thy sweetness is so much within me placed , 
That shouldst thou Nectar give 't would spoil the taste , 
Beauty at first moves wonder and delight ; 
't is Nature's Juggling trick to cheat the sight , 
Wee'admire it , whilst unknown , but after more 
Admire ourselves , for liking it before . 
Love , like a greedy Hawk , if we give way , 
Does over-gorge himself , with his own Prey ; 
Of very hopes a surfeit he 'll sustain , 
Unless by fears he cast them up again . 
His spirit and sweetness dangers keep alone ; 
If once he loose his sting he grows a Drone . 
Love undiscovered . 

1.  

I others may with safety tell 
The moderate Flames which in them dwell ; 
And either find some Med'cin there , 
Or cure themselves even by Despair ; 
My love 's so great that it might prove 
Dangerous to tell her that I Love. 
So tender is my wound , it must not bear 
Any salute though of the kindest air . 
2.  

I would not have her know the pain , 
The Torments for her I sustain . 
lest too much goodness make her throw 
Her Love upon a Fate too how . 
forbid it Heaven my Life should be 
Weighed with her least Conveniency ; 
no : let me perish rather with my grief , 
then to her disadvantage find relief . 
3.  

Yet when I die my last breath shall 
Grow bold , and plainly tell her all . 
Like covetous men who ne'er descry 
Their dear hide Treasures till they die . 
Ah fairest Maid , how should it cheer 
My Ghost , to get from Thee a Tear ▪ 
But take heed : for if me thou Pitiest then , 
Twenty to one but I shall live again . 
The given Heart . 

1.  

I Wonder what those Lovers mean , who say 
They have given their Hearts away . 
Some good kind Lover , tell me how ; 
For mine is but a Torment to me now . 
2.  

If so it be , one place both hearts contain , 
For what do they complain ? 
What courtesy can Love do more , 
then join Hearts , that parted were before ? 
3.  

Woe to her stubborn Heart , if once mine come 
Into the self same room ; 
'T will tear and blow up all within , 
Like a Granado shot into a Magazine . 
4.  

then shall Love keep the ashes and torn parts , 
Of both our broken Hearts ; 
Shall out of both one new one make 
From hers , th' allay , from mine the Mettle take . 
5.  

For of her heart , he from the Flames will find 
But little left behind : 
Mine only will remain entire ; 
no dross was there , to perish in the Fire . 
The Prophet . 

1.  

Teach me to Love ? go teach thyself more wit ; 
I chief Professor am of it . 
Teach craft to Scots , and thrift to Jews , 
Teach boldness to the Stews , 
In Tyrant's Courts teach suppling flattery , 
Teach Sophisters and Jesuits to lie . 
Teach fire to burn , and winds to blow , 
Teach restless fountains how to flow , 
Teach the dull earth fixed to abide , 
Teach Women kind , Inconstancy and Pride ▪ 
See if your diligence here will useful prove ; 
But , neither , teach not me to Love.  
2.  

The God of Love , if such a thing there be , 
May learn to love from Me . 
He who does boast that he has been 
In every Heart since Adam's sin , 
I 'll lay my Life , my Mistress on 't , that 's more ; 
I 'll teach him things he never knew before : 
I 'll teach him a Receipt to make 
Tears , which shall understand , and speak : 
I 'll teach him Sighs , like those in Death , 
At which the Soul goes out too with the breath ▪ 
Still the Soul stays , yet still does from me run ▪ 
As light and heat does with the Sun.  
3.  

't is I who Love's Columbus am ; 't is I : 
Who must new Worlds in it descry . 
Rich Worlds that yield of Treasure more , 
Than all that has been known before . 
And yet like his ( I fear ) my Fate must be , 
To find them out for others , not for Me. 
Mee'times to come , I know it , shall 
Loves last and greatest Prophet call . 
But , ah , what 's this , if she refuse , 
To hear the wholesome Doctrines of my Muse ? 
If to my share the Prophet's Fate must come . 
Hereafter Fame , here Martyrdom . 
The Resolution . 

1.  

The Devil take those foolish men , 
Who gave you first such powers ; 
We stood on even grounds till then , 
If any odds , Creation made it ours . 
2.  

For shame let these weak chains be broke ; 
Let's our slight bonds like Samson tear ; 
And nobly cast away that yoke , 
Which we nor our Forefathers ere could bear . 
3.  

French Laws forbid the female Reign , 
Yet Love does them to slavery draw , 
Alas , if we 'll our rights maintain . 
't is all Mankind must make a Salic Law.  
Called Inconstant . 

1.  

ha ! ha ! you think you've killed my fame ; 
By this not understood , yet common Name ; 
A Name , that 's full and proper when assigned 
To Womankind : 
But when you call us so , 
It can at best but for a Metaphor go . 
2.  

Can you the shore Inconstant call , 
Which still as Waves pass by , embraces all ? 
That had as lief the same waves always love , 
Did they not from him move ? 
Or can you faults with Pilots find 
For changing course , yet never blame the wind ? 
3.  

Since drunk with vanity you fell : 
The things turn round to you that steadfast dwell ; 
And you yourself who from us take your flight 
Wonder to find us out of sight . 
So the same error ceazes you 
As men in motion think the Trees move too . 
The Welcome . 

1.  

GO , let the fatted Calf be killed ; 
My Prodigal's come home at last : 
With noble resolutions filled , 
And filled with sorrow for the past . 
no more will burn with Love or Wine : 
But quite has left his Women , and his Swine . 
2.  

Welcome , ah , welcome my poor Heart ; 
Welcome : I little thought , I 'll swear , 
( 't is now so long since we did part ) 
Ever again to see thee here : 
Dear wanderer , since from me you fled , 
How often have I heard that you were dead . 
3.  

Had it thou found each woman's breast 
( The Lands where thou hast traveled ) 
Either by Savages possessed , 
Or wild , and uninhabited ? 
What joy couldst take , or what repose 
In Countries so uncivilised as those ? 
4.  

Lust the scorching Dogstar here 
Rages with immoderate heat ; 
Whilst Pride the rugged Northern Bear , 
In others makes the cold too great . 
And where these are temperate known , 
The Soil's all barren Land , or rocky Stone . 
5.  

When once or twice you chanced to view 
A rich , well-governed Heart , 
Like China , it admitted you 
But to the Frontiere-part . 
From Paradise shut for evermore , 
What good is't that an angel shut the Door ? 
6.  

Welfare the Pride and the Disdain 
And Vanities with Beauty joined , 
I ne'er had seen this Heart again , 
If any Fair one had been kind ; 
My Dove , but once let loose , I doubt 
Would never return had not the Flood been out . 
The Heart fled again . 

1.  

False foolish Heart , didst thou not say 
That thou wouldst never leave me more 
Behold again 't is fled away ; 
Fled as far from me as before . 
I striven to bring it again , 
I cried and hollowed after it in vain . 
2.  

Even so the gentle Tyrian Dame , 
When neither Grief nor Love prevail , 
saw the dear object of her flame 
Th'ingratfull Trojan hoist his sail ▪ 
Aloud she called to him to stay ; 
The wind bore him and her lost words away . 
3.  

The doleful Ariadne so , 
On the wide shore forsaken stood : 
False Theseus , whither dost thou go ? 
A fair false Theseus cut the flood . 
But Bacchus came to her relief ; 
Bacchus himself 's too weak to ease my grief . 
4.  

Ah senseless Heart to take no rest , 
But travail thus eternally ! 
Thus to be frozen in every breast ! 
And to be scorched in every Eye ! 
Wand'ring about like wretched Cain , 
Thrust out , ill used by all , but by none slain ! 
5.  

Well , since thou wilt not here remain , 
I 'll even to live without Thee try ; 
My Head shall take the greater pain , 
And all thy duties shall supply ; 
I can more easily live I know 
Without Thee , then without a Mistress thou . 
Woman's Superstition . 

1.  

OR I 'm a very Dunce , or Womankind 
Is a most unintelligible thing : 
I can no Sense , nor no Contexture find , 
Nor their loose parts to Method bring , 
I know not what the Learned may see , 
But they 're strange Hebrew things to Me.  
2.  

By Customs and Traditions they live , 
And foolish Ceremonies of antic date 
We Lovers , new and better Doctrines give . 
Yet they continue obstinate 
Preach we , Love's Prophets , what we will , 
Like Jews they keep their old Law still . 
3.  

Before their Mother's Gods they fond fall , 
Vain Idol Gods , that have no Sense nor Mind : 
Honours their Ashtaroth , and Pride their Baal , 
The Thundering Baal of Womankind . 
With twenty other Devils more , 
Which They , as we do Them , adore . 
4.  

But then like Men , both Covetous and Devout , 
Their costly Superstition loath t'omit , 
And yet more loath to issue Monies out . 
At their own charge to furnish it . 
To these expensive Deities 
The Hearts of men they sacrifice . 
The Soul . 

1.  

Some dull Philosopher when he hears me say , 
My Soul is from me fled away . 
Nor has of late informed my Body here , 
But in another's breast does lie , 
That neither , is nor will ! be I , 
As a Form Servient , and Assisting there . 
2.  

Will cry , Absurd ! and ask me how I live : 
And Syllogisms against it give ; 
A curse on all your vain Philosophies , 
Which on weak Nature's Law depend , 
And know not how to comprehend 
Love and Religion , those great Mysteries . 
3.  

Her Body is my Soul ; laugh not at this , 
For by my life I swear it is . 
't is that preserves my Being and my Breath , 
From that proceeds all that I do , 
Nay all my thoughts and speeches too , 
And separation from it is my Death . 
Echo . 

1.  

Tired with the rough denials of my prayer , 
From that hard she whom I obey , 
I come in and find a Nymph much gentler here , 
That gives consent to all I say . 
Ah gentle Nymph , who lik'st so well , 
In hollow , solitary Caves to dwell . 
Her Heart being such , into it go , 
And do but once from thence answer me so . 
2.  

Complaisant Nymph , who dost thus kindly share , 
In griefs whose cause thou dost not know ! 
Hadst thou but Eyes , as well as Tongue and Ear , 
How much compassion wouldst thou show ! 
Thy flame , whilst living , or a flower , 
Was of less beauty , and less ravishing power ; 
Alas I might as easily , 
Paint thee to her , as describe Her to Thee . 
3.  

By repercussion Beams engender Fire , 
Shape's by reflection shapes beget , 
The voice itself , when stopped , does back retire 
And a new voice is made by it . 
Thus things by opposition 
The gainers grow ; my barren Love alone , 
Does from her stony breast rebound 
Producing neither Image , Fire , nor Sound . 
The rich Rival . 

1.  

They say you 're angry and rant mightily , 
Because I love the same as you ; 
Alas ! you 're very rich , 't is true ; 
But prithee Fool what 's that to Love , and Me ? 
You have Land and Money , let that serve , 
And know you have more by that than you deserve . 
2.  

When next I see my fair One , we shall know , 
How worthless thou art of her bed ? 
And wretch , I 'll strike thee dumb and dead ; 
With noble verse not understood by you ; 
Whilst thy sole Rhetoric shall be 
Jointure , and Jewels , and Our Friends agree . 
3.  

Pox o' your friends that dote and Domineer : 
Lovers are better friends they they : 
Let 's those in other things obey , 
The Fates , and Stars , and Gods must govern here . 
Vain names of Blood ! in Love let none 
Advice with any Blood , but with their own . 
4.  

't is that which bids me this bright Maid adore ; 
no other thought has had access ! 
Did she now beg I 'd love do less , 
And were she'an Empress I should love no more ; 
Were she as just and true to Me , 
Ah , simple soul , what would become of Thee ! 
Against Hope . 

1.  

Hope whose weak Being ruined is , 
Alike if it succeed , and if it miss ; 
Whom Good , or Ill does equally confound , 
And both the Horns of Fates Dilemma wound ! 
Vain shadow , which dost vanish quite 
Both at full Noon , and perfect Night ! 
The Stars have not a possibility 
Of blessing Thee ; 
If things then from their End we happy call , 
't is Hope is the most hopeless thing of all ; 
2.  

Hope thou bold Taster of Delight , 
Who whilst thou shouldst but taste , devour'st it quite ! 
thou bringst us an Estate , yet leav'st us Poor , 
By clogging it with Legacies before ! 
The Joys which we entire should wed , 
Come deflowered Virgins to our bed ; 
Good fortunes without gain imported be , 
Such mighty Customs paid to Thee . 
For Joy , like Wine , kept close , does better taste , 
If it take air , before his spirits waste . 
3.  

Hope , Fortunes cheating Lottery ! 
Where for one prise an hundred blanks there be ; 
Fond Archer , Hope , who tak'st thy aim so far , 
That still or short or wide thine arrows are ! 
Thin , empty Cloud , which th' eye deceives 
With shapes that our own Fancy gives ! 
A Cloud , which guilt and painted now appears , 
But must drop presently in tears ! 
When thy false beams o'er Reason's light prevail 
By Ignes fatui for North Stars we sail . 
4.  

Brother of Fear , more gaily clad ! 
The mer'rier Fool o'th' two , yet quite as mad : 
Sire of Repentance , Child of fond Desire ! 
That blows the Chemics , and the Lover's fire ! 
Leading them still in sensibly on 
By the strong witchcraft of Anon ! 
By Thee the one does changing Nature through 
Her endless Labyrinths pursue , 
And th' other chaces Woman , whilst She goes 
more ways and turns then hunted Nature knows . 
For Hope . 

1.  

Hope , of all Ills that men endure , 
The only cheap and universal Cure ! 
thou Captiv's Freedom , and thou sick-man's Health ! 
thou Losers Victory , and thou Beggars wealth ! 
thou Manna , which from Heaven we eat , 
To every taste a several Meat ! 
thou strong Retreat ! thou sure entailed Estate , 
Which naught has power to alienate ! 
thou pleasant , honest , Flatterer ! for none 
Flatter unhappy Men , but thou alone ! 
2.  

Hope , thou first Fruits of Happiness ! 
thou gentle Downing of a bright Success ! 
thou good Preparative , without which our Joy 
Does work too strong , and whilst it cures , destroy ; 
Who out of Fortune's reach dost stand 
And art a blessing still in hand ! 
Whilst Thee , her Earnest Money we retain , 
We certain are to gain , 
Whether she her bargain break , or else fulfil 
thou only good , not worse for ending ill ! 
Brother of Faith , betwixt whom and Thee 
The joys of Heaven and Earth divided be ! 
Though Faith be Heir , and have the fixed estate , 
Thy Portion yet in Movables is great . 
Happiness itself 's all one 
In Thee , or in Possession ! 
Only the Future's thine , the Present His ! 
Thine's the more hard and noble bliss , 
Best apprehender of our joys , which hast 
So long a reach , and yet canst hold so fast ! 
4.  

Hope thou sad Lovers only Friend ! 
thou Way that mayst dispute it with the End ! 
For Love I fear 's a fruit that does delight 
The taste itself less than the Smell and sight . 
Fruition more deceitful is 
then thou canst be , when thou dost miss ; 
Men leave thee by obtaining , and straight flee 
Some other way again to Thee ; 
And that 's a pleasant Country , without doubt , 
To which all soon return that travail out . 
Love's Ingratitude . 

1.  

I Little thought , thou fond ingrateful Sin , 
When first I let thee in , 
And gave thee but a part 
In my unwary Heart , 
That thou wouldst ere have grown , 
So false or strong to make it all thine own . 
2.  

At mine own breast with care I fed thee still , 
Letting thee suck thy fill , 
And daintily I nourished Thee 
With Idle thoughts and Poetry ! 
What ill returns dost thou allow ? 
I fed thee then , and thou dost starve me now . 
3.  

There was a time when thou wast cold and i'll , 
Nor hadst the power of doing ill ; 
Into my bosom did I take , 
This frozen and benumbed Snake , 
Not fearing from it any harm ; 
But now it stings that breast that made it warm . 
4.  

What cursed weed's this Love ! but one grain sow 
And the whole field 't will overgrow ; 
Straight will it choke up and devour 
Each wholesome herb and beauteous flower ! 
Nay unless something soon I do , 
'T will kill I fear , my very Laurel too . 
5.  

But now all 's gone , I now , alas , complain , 
Declare , protest , and threat in vain . 
Since by my own unforced consent 
The Traitor has my Government , 
And is so settled in the Throne , 
That 't were Rebellion now to claim mine own . 
The Frailty . 

1.  

I Know 't is sordid , and 't is low ; 
( All this as well as you I know ) 
Which I so hotly now pursue ; 
I know all this as well as you ) 
But whilst this cursed flesh I bear , 
And all the Weakness , and the Baseness there , 
Alas , alas , it will be always so . 
2.  

In vain , exceedingly in vain 
I rage's sometimes , and bite my Chain ; 
For to what purpose do I bite 
With Teeth , which ne'er will break it quite ? 
For if the chiefest Christian Head 
Was by this sturdy Tyrant buffeted , 
What wonder is it , if weak I be slain ? 
3.  

As when the Sun appears , 
The Morning Thickness clears ; 
So , when my thoughts let sadness in , 
And a new Morning does begin , 
If any Beauty's piercing ray 
Strike through my Trembling Eyes a sudden day ; 
All those grave sullen Vapours melt in Tears . 
Coldness . 

1.  

AS water fluid is , till it do grow 
Solid and fixed by Cold ; 
So in warm Seasons Love does loosely flow , 
Frost only can it hold . 
A Woman's rigour and disdain 
Does his swift course restrain . 
2.  

Though constant , and consistent now it be , 
Yet when kind beams appear , 
It melts and glides apace into the Sea , 
And loses itself there . 
So the Sun's amorous play 
Kisses the Ice away . 
3.  

You may in Vulgar Loves find always this ; 
But my Substantial Love 
Of a more firm and perfect Nature is ; 
no weathers can it move : 
Though heat dissolve the Ice again , 
The Crystal solid does remain . 
The Enjoyment . 

1.  

Then like some wealth Island thou shalt lie ; 
And like the Sea about it , I ; 
thou like fair Albion to the Sailors Sight 
Spreading her beauteous Bosom all in White : 
Like the kind Ocean I will be 
With loving Arms for ever clasping Thee . 
2.  

But I 'll embrace Thee gentlier far than so ; 
As their fresh Banks soft Rivers do , 
Nor shall the proudest Planet boast a power 
Of making my full Love to ebb one hour ; 
It never dry nor low can prove , 
Whilst thy unwasted Fountain feeds my Love.  
3.  

Such Heat and Vigour shall our Kisses bear , 
As if like Doves wee'engendred there . 
no bound nor rule my pleasures shall endure , 
In Love there 's none too much an Epicure . 
Naught shall my Hands or Lips control ; 
I 'll kiss Thee trough , I 'll kiss thy very Soul . 
4.  

Yet nothing but the Night our sports shall know ; 
Night that 's both blind and silent too . 
Alpheus found not a more secret trace — 
His loved Sicanian Fountain to embrace , 
Creeping beneath the Aegaean Sea , 
then I will do t' enjoy , and feast on Thee . 
5.  

Men , out of Wisdom , Women , out of Pride , 
The pleasant Thefts of Love do hide . 
That may secure thee , but thou hast yet from Me 
A more infallible Security . 
For there 's no danger I should tell 
The Joys , which are to me unspeakable . 
Sleep . 

1.  

IN vain , thou drowsy God , I thee invoke ; 
For thou who dost from fumes arise , 
thou who Man's Soul dost over-shade 
With a thick Cloud , by Vapours made , 
Canst have no power to shut his eyes , 
Or passage of his Spirits to choke , 
Whose flams so pure that it sends up no smoke . 
2.  

Yet how do Tears but from some Vapours rise ? 
Tears that bewinter all my Year ? 
The fate of Egypt I sustain , 
And never feel the dew of Rain , 
From Clouds within the Head appear , 
But all my too much Moisture owe 
To overflowing of the Heart below . 
3.  

thou who dost Men ( as Nights to Colours do ) 
Bring all to an Equality : 
Come thou just God , and equal me 
A while to my disdainful Shee ; 
In that condition let me lie ; 
Till Love does the same favour show ; 
Love equals all a better way than You.  
4.  

then never more shalt thou be invoked by me ; 
Watchful as Spirits , and Gods I 'll prove : 
Let her but grant , and then will I 
Thee and thy Kinsman Death defy . 
For betwixt Thee and them that love , 
Never will an agreement be ; 
thou scornest the Unhappy , and the Happy Thee . 
Beauty . 

1.  

Beauty thou wild fantastic Ape , 
Who dost in every Country change thy shape ! 
Here black , there brown , here tawny , and there white ; 
thou Flatt'rer which complyest with every sight ! 
thou Babel , which confounds the Eye , 
With unintelligible variety ! 
Who hast no certain when , nor where , 
But vary'st still , and dost thyself declare 
Inconstant , as thy she-possessours are . 
2.  

Beauty Love's Scene and Maskerade , 
So gay by well-placed Lights , and Distance made ! 
False Coin , with which th'imposture cheats us still ; 
The stamp and Colour good , but Mettle ill ! 
Which Light or Base we find when we 
Weigh by enjoyment and examine Thee ! 
For though thy Being be but show , 
't is chiefly Night which men to Thee allow : 
And choose t' enjoy Thee , when thou least art thou . 
3.  

Beauty , thou Active , Passive Ill ! 
Which diest thyself as fast as thou dost kill ! 
thou Tulip , who thy stock in paint dost waste , 
Neither for Physic good , nor Smell , nor Tast. 
Beauty whose Flames but Meteors are , 
Short-lived and low , though thou wouldst seem a Star , 
Who dar'st not thine own Home descry , 
Pretending to dwell richly in the Eye , 
When thou , alas , dost in the Fancy lie . 
4.  

Beauty , whose Conquests still are made 
O'er Hearts by Cowards kept , or else betrayed ! 
Weak Victor ! who thyself destroyed must be 
When sickness storms , or Time besieges Thee ! 
Thou'unwholsome Thaw to frozen Age ? 
thou strong Wine , which youths Fever dost enrage , 
thou Tyrant which leav'st no man free ! 
thou subtle thief , from whom none safe can be ! 
thou Murderer which hast killed , and Devil which wouldst Damn me . 
The Parting . 

1.  

AS Men in Groenland left beheld the Sun 
From their Horizon run ; 
And thought upon the sad half year 
Of Cold and Darkness they must suffer there . 
2.  

So on my parting Mistress did I look , 
With such swollen eyes my farewell took ; 
Ah , my fair Star , said I , 
Ah those blessed Lands to which bright thou dost fly ? 
3.  

In vain the Men of Learning comfort me ; 
And say I 'm in a warm degree ; 
Say what they please ; I say and swear 
't is be yond eighty at least , if you 're not here . 
4.  

It is , it is ; I tremble with the Frost , 
And know that I the Day have lost ; 
And those wild things which Men they call , 
I find to be but bears and Foxes all . 
5.  

Return , return , gay Planet of the East , 
Of all that shines thou much the best ! 
And as thou now descends to Sea ; 
more fair and fresh rise up from thence to Me . 
6.  

thou , who in many a Prop'riety 
So truly art the Sun to Me , 
Add one more likeness , which I 'm sure you can , 
And let Me and my Sun beget a Man  
My Picture . 

1.  

Here , take my likeness with you , whilst 't is so ; 
For when from hence you go , 
The next Suns rising will behold 
Me pale , and lean , and old . 
The Man , who did this Picture draw , 
Will swear next day my face he never saw 
2.  

I really believe , within a while , 
If you upon this shadow smile , 
Your presence will such vigour give , 
( Your presence which makes all things live ) 
And absence so much alter Me , 
This will the substance , I the shadow be . 
3.  

When from your well-wrought Cabinet you take it , 
And your bright looks awake it ; 
Ah be not frighted , if you see 
The new sold Picture gaze on Thee , 
And hear it breathe a sigh or two ; 
For those are the first things that it will do . 
4.  

My Rival Image will be then thought blessed , 
And laugh at me as dispossessed : 
But thou , who ( if I know thee right ) 
i' th' substance doth not much delight , 
Will't rather send again for Me , 
Who then shalt but my Pictures Picture be . 
The Concealment . 

1.  

no ; to what purpose should I speak ? 
no wretched Heart , swell till you break ! 
She cannot love me if She would ; 
And to say truth , 't were pity that she should . 
no , to the Grave thy sorrows bear , 
As silent as they will be there : 
Since that loved hand this Mortal wound does give , 
So handsomely the thing contrive , 
That she may guiltless of it live . 
So perish , that her kill Thee 
May a chance Medley , and no Murder be . 
2.  

't is nobler much for me that I 
By'her Beauty , not her Anger die ; 
This will look justly , and become 
An Execution , that , a Martyrdom . 
The censuring World will never refrain 
From judging men by Thunder slain . 
She must be angry sure , if I should be 
So bold to ask her to make me 
By being hers , happier than she 
I will not ; 't is a milder Fate 
To fall by her not Loving , than her Hate . 
And yet this death of mine , I fear , 
Will ominous to her appear : 
When , sound in every other part , 
Her Sacrifice is found without an Heart . 
For the last Tempest of my death 
Shall sigh out that too with my breath . 
then shall the world my noble ruin see , 
Some pity , and some envy Me , 
then She herself , the mighty She 
Shall grace my fun'ralls with this truth ; 
'T was only Love destroyed the gentle Youth . 
The Monopoly . 

1.  

What mines of Sulphur in my breast do lie , 
That feed th' eternal burnings of my heart ? 
Not Aetna flames more fierce or constantly , 
The sounding shop of Vulcan's smoky art ; 
Vulcan his shop has placed there , 
And Cupid's Forge is set up here . 
2.  

Here all those Arrows mortal Heads are made , 
That fly so thick unseen through yielding air ; 
The Cyclops here , which labour at the trade 
Are Jealousy , Fear , Sadness , and Despair . 
Ah cruel God and why to me 
Gave you this cursed Monopoly ! 
3.  

I have the trouble not the gains of it ; 
Give me but the disposal of one Dart ; 
And then ( I 'll ask no other benefit ) 
Heat as you please your furnace in my Heart . 
So sweet's Revenge to me , that I 
Upon my foe would gladly die . 
4.  

Deep into'her bosom would I strike the dart ; 
Deeper than Woman ere was struck by Thee ; 
thou giv'st them small wounds , & so far from th' heart , 
They flutter still about inconstantly . 
Curse on thy Goodness , whom we find 
Civil to none but Womankind ! 
5.  

Vain God who women dost thyself adore ! 
Their wounded Hearts do still retain the powers 
To travail and to wander as before ; 
Thy broken Arrows betwixt that Sex and ours 
So'unjustly are distributed ; 
They take their Feathers , we the Head.  
The distance . 

1.  

I'have followed thee a year at least , 
And never stopped myself to rest . 
But yet can thee o'ertake no more , 
then this Day can the Day that went before . 
2.  

In this our fortunes equal prove 
To Stars which govern them above ; 
Our Stars that move for ever round 
With the same Distance still betwixt them found . 
3.  

In vain , alas , in vain I strive 
The wheel of Fate faster to drive ; 
Since if round swiftlier it fly , 
She in it mends her pace as much as I  
4.  

Hearts by Love strangely shuffled are , 
That there can never meet a Pare ! 
Tamelier than Worms are Lovers slain ; 
The wounded Heart never turns to wound again . 
The Increase . 

1.  

I Thought I 'll swear I could have loved no more 
Than I had done before ; 
But you as easily might accounted 
Till to the top of numbers you amount , 
As cast up my Love's score . 
Ten thousand million was the sum ; 
Million of endless Million are to come . 
2.  

I 'm sure her Beauties cannot greater grow ; 
Why should my Love do so ? 
A real cause at first did move ; 
But mine own Fancy now drives on my Love , 
With shadows from itself that flow . 
My Love , as we in Numbers see , 
By Ciphers is increased eternally . 
3.  

So the new made , and untride Spheres above 
took their first turn from th' hand of Jove ; 
But are since that beginning found 
By their own Forms to turn for ever round . 
All violent Motions short do prove , 
But by the length 't is plain to see 
That love 's a Motion Natural to Me . 
Love's Visibility . 

1.  

With much of pain , and all the Art I knew 
Have I endeavoured hitherto 
To hide my Love , and yet all will not do . 
2.  

The world perceives it , and , it may be , she ; 
Though so discreet and good she be , 
By hiding it , to teach that skill to Me . 
3.  

Men without Love have so oft cunning grown , 
That something like it they have shown , 
But none that had it ever seemed to have none . 
4.  

Loves of a strangely open , simple kind , 
Can no arts or disguises find , 
But thinks none sees it , cause itself is blind . 
5.  

The very Eye betrays our inward smart ; 
Love of himself left there a part , 
When through it he passed into the Heart . 
6.  

Or if by chance the face betray not it , 
But keep the secret wisely , yet , 
Like Drunkenness , into the Tongue 't will get . 
Looking on , and discoursing with his Mistress . 

1.  

These full two hours now have I gazing been , 
What comfort by it can I gain ? 
To look on Heaven with mighty Gulfs between 
Was the great Miser's greatest pain : 
So near was he to Heaven's delight , 
As with the blessed converse he might , 
Yet could not get one drop of water by 't . 
2.  

Ah wretch : I seem to touch her now , but , o , 
What boundless spaces do us part ? 
Fortune , and Friends , and all earth's empty show , 
My Lowness , and her high Desert : 
But these might conquerable prove : 
Nothing does me so far remove , 
As her hard Souls aversion from my Love.  
3.  

So Travellers that loose their way by Night , 
If from a far they chance t' spy 
th' uncertain glimmerings of a Tapers light , 
Take flatterring hopes and think it nigh ; 
Till wearied with the fruitless pain , 
They sit them down , and weep in vain , 
And there in Darkness and Despair remain . 
Resolved to Love.  

1.  

I Wonder what the Grave and Wise 
Think of all us that Love ; 
Whether our pretty Fooleries 
Their Mirth or Anger move ; 
They understand not Breath , that Words do want ; 
Our Sighs to them are unsignificant . 
2.  

One of them saw me th' other day , 
Touch the dear hand which I admire ; 
My Soul was melting straight away , 
And dropped before the Fire . 
This silly Wiseman , who pretends to know , 
Asked why I looked so pale , and trembled so ? 
3.  

Another from my Mistress ' door ▪ 
Saw me with eyes all watery come ; 
Nor could the hidden cause explore , 
But thought some smoke was in the room ; 
Such Ignorance from unwounded Learning Game ; 
He knew Tears made by Smoak , but not by Flame . 
4.  

If learned in other things you be , 
And have in Love no skill , 
For God's sake keep your arts from me , 
For I 'll be ignorant still . 
Study or Action others may embrace ; 
My love 's my Business , and my Books her Face . 
5.  

These are but trifles I confess , 
Which me , weak Mortal , move ; 
Nor is your busy Seriousness 
Less trifling than my Love. 
The wisest King who from his sacred breast 
Pronounced all Vanity , choose it for the best . 
My Fate . 

1.  

GO bid the Needle his dear North forsake , 
To which with trembling reve'rence it does bend ; 
Go bid the Stones a journey upward make ; 
Go bid th' ambitious Flame no more t' ascend : 
And when these false to their old Motions prove , 
then shall I cease Thee , Thee alone to Love.  
2.  

The fast-linked Chain of everlasting Fate 
Does nothing tie more strong , then Me to You ; 
My fixed Love hangs not on your Love or Hate ; 
But will be still the same , what ere you do . 
You cannot kill my Love with your disdain , 
Wound it you may , and make it live in pain . 
3.  

Me , mine examples let the Stoics use , 
Their sad and cruel doctrine to maintain , 
Let all Predestinators me produce , 
Who struggle with eternal bonds in vain . 
This Fire I 'm born to , but 't is she must tell , 
whether 't be beams of Heaven , or Flames of Hell.  
4.  

You who men's fortunes in their faces read , 
To find out mine , look not , alas , on Me ; 
But mark her Face , and all the Features heed ; 
For only there is written my Destiny . 
Or if Stars show it , gaze not on the skies : 
But study the Astrol'ogy of her Eyes . 
5.  

If thou find there kind and propitious ways , 
What Mars or Saturn threaten I 'll not fear ; 
I well believe the Fate of mortal days 
Is written in Heaven ; but , o , my Heaven is there . 
What can men learn from Stars , they scarce can see ? 
Two great Lights rule the World , and her two , Me.  
The Heart-breaking . 

1.  

IT gave a piteous groan , and so it broke ; 
In vain it something would have spoken : 
The Love within too strong fort was , 
Like Poison put into a Venice Glass . 
2.  

I thought that this some Remedy might prove , 
But , o , the mighty Serpent Love , 
Cut by this chance in pieces small , 
In all still lived , and still it stung in all . 
3.  

And now ( alas ) each little broken part 
Feels the whole pain of all my Heart : 
And every smallest corner still 
Life's with that torment which the Whole did kill . 
4.  

Even so rude Armies when the field they quit , 
And into several Quarters get ; 
Each Troop does spoil and ruin more , 
then all joined in one body did before . 
5.  

How many Love's reign in my bosom now ? 
How many Loves , yet all of you ? 
Thus have I changed with evil fate 
My Monarch Love , into a Tyrant State.  
The Usurpation . 

1.  

Thou'hadst to my Soul no title or pretence ; 
I was mine own and free , 
Till I had given myself to Thee ; 
But thou hast me Slave and Prisoner since . 
Well , since so insolent thou 'rt grown , 
Fond Tyrant , I 'll depose thee from thy Throne ; 
Such outrages must not admitted be 
In an Elective Monarchy . 
2.  

Part of my Heart by Gift did to Thee fall ; 
My Country , Kindred , and my best 
Acquaintance were to share the rest ; 
But thou , their Covetous Neighbour , drav'st out all : 
Nay more , thou mak'st me worship Thee , 
And wouldst the rule of my Religion be : 
Was ever Tyrant claimed such power as you , 
To be both Emperor , and Pope too ? 
3.  

The public Mise'ries , and my private fate 
Deserve some tears : but greedy thou 
Insatiate Maid ! ) wilt not allow 
That I one drop from thee should alienate . 
Nor wilt thou grant my sins a part , 
Though the sole cause of most of them thou art , 
Counting my Tears thy Tribute and thy Due , 
Since first mine Eyes I gave to You 
4.  

thou all my Joys , and all my Hopes dost claim , 
thou ragest like a Fire in me , 
Converting all things into Thee ; 
Naught can resist , or not increase the Flame . 
Nay every Grief , and every Fear 
thou dost devour , unless thy stamp it bear . 
Thy presence like the crowned Basilisks breath , 
All other Serpents puts to death . 
5.  

As men in Hell are from Diseases free , 
So from all other ills an I ; 
Free from their known Formality . 
But all pains eminently lie in Thee . 
Alas , alas , I hope in vain 
My conquered Soul from out thine hands to gain , 
Since all the Natives there thou 'st overthrown , 
And planted Garrisons of thine own . 
Maidenhead . 

1.  

Thou worst Estate even of the sex that 's worst ; 
Therefore by Nature made at first , 
T' attend the weakness of our birth ! 
'Slight , outward Curtain to the Nuptial Bed ! 
thou Case to buildings not yet finished ▪ 
Who like the Centre of the Earth , 
Dost heaviest things attract to thee , 
Though thou a point imaginary be . 
2.  

A thing God thought for Mankind so unfit , 
That his first blessing ruined it . 
Cold frozen Nurse of fiercest fires ! 
Who , like the parched plains of Africks' sand , 
( A sterile , and a wild unlovely Land ) 
Art always scorched with hot desires , 
Yet barren quite didst thou not bring 
Monsters and Serpents forth thyself to sting ! 
3.  

thou that bewitchest men , whilst thou dost dwell 
Like a close Conj'urer in his Cell ! 
And fearest the days discovering Eye ! 
no wonder 't is at all that thou shouldst be 
Such tedious and unpleasant company , 
Who liv'st so Melancholy ! 
thou thing of subtle , slippery kind , 
Which Women loose , and yet no Man can find ! 
4.  

Although I think thou never found wilt be , 
Yet I 'm resolved to search for thee ; 
The search itself rewards the pains , 
So , though the Chemic his great secret miss , 
( For neither it in Art nor Nature is ) 
Yet things well worth his toil he gains : 
And does his Charge and Labour richly pay 
With good unsought exper'iments by the way . 
5.  

Say what thou wilt , Chastity is no more , 
Thee , than a Porter is his Dore. 
In vain to honour they pretend 
Who guard themselves with Ramparts and with Walls , 
Them only Fame the truly valiant calls 
Who can an open breach depend . 
Of thy quick loss can be no doubt , 
Within so Hated , and so Loved without . 
Impossibilities . 

1.  

Impossibilities ? o no , there 's none ; 
could mine bring thy Heart Captive home ; 
As easily other dangers were o'erthrown , 
As Cesar after vanquished Rome , 
His little Asian foes did overcome . 
2.  

True Lovers oft by Fortune are envied , 
oft Earth and Hell against them strive ; 
But Providence engages on their side , 
And a good end at last does give ; 
At last Just Men and Lovers always thrive . 
3.  

As stars ( not powerful else ) when they conjoin , 
Change , as they please , the World's estate ; 
So thy Heart in Conjunction with mine 
Shall our own fortunes regulate ; 
And to the Stars themselves prescribe a Fate . 
4.  

'T would grieve me much to find some bold Romance 
That should too kind examples show , 
Which before us in wonders did advance ; 
Not , that I thought that story true , 
But none should Fancy more , than I would Do . 
5.  

Through spite of our worst Enemies , thy Friends , 
Through Local Banishment from me ; 
Through the loud thoughts of selfe-concerning Ends , 
As easy shall my passage be , 
As was the Am'orous youth 's o'er Helles Sea.  
6.  

In vain the Winds , in vain the Billows roar ; 
In vain the Stars their aid denied : 
He saw the Sestian Tower on th' other shore ; 
Shall th'hellespont our Loves divide ? 
no , not th'atlantic Ocean's bound less Tide . 
7.  

Such Seas betwixt us easily conquered are ; 
But , gentle Maid , do not deny 
To let thy Beams shine on me from afar ; 
And still that Taper let me ' espy : 
For when thy Light goes out , I sink , and die . 
Silence . 

1.  

Curse on this Tongue that has my Heart betrayed , 
And his great Secret open laid ! 
For of all persons chiefly She , 
Should not the ills I suffer know ; 
Since ' does a thing might dangerous grow , 
Only in her to Pity Me : 
Since 't is for Me to lose my Life more fit , 
then 't is for her to save and ransom it . 
2.  

Ah never more shall thy unwilling ear , 
My helpless story hear . 
Discourse and talk away does keep 
The rude unquiet pain , 
That in my Breast does reign ; 
Silence perhaps may make it sleep . 
I 'll bind that Sore up , I did ill reveal ; 
The Wound if once it Close , may chance to Heal.  
3.  

no , 't will ne'er heal ; my Love will never die , 
Though it should Speechless lie . 
A River ere it meet the Sea , 
As well might stay its source , 
As my Love can his course , 
Unless it join and mix with Thee . 
If any end or stop of it be found , 
We know the Flood runs still , though underground . 
The Dissembler . 

1.  

Unhurt , untouched did I complain ; 
And terrified all others with the pain : 
But now I feel the mighty evil ; 
Ah , there 's no fooling with the Devil ! 
So wanton men , whilst others they would fright , 
Themselves have met a real Spirit . 
2.  

I thought , I 'll swear , an handsomely 
Had been no sin at all in Poetry : 
But now I suffer an Arrest 
For words were spoken by me in jest . 
Dull , sottish God of Love , and can it be 
thou understandest not Raillery ? 
3.  

Darts , and Wounds , and Flame , and Heat , 
I named but for the Rhyme , or the Conceit . 
Nor meant my verse should raised be 
To this sad fame of Prophecy ; 
Truth gives a Dull Propriety to my stile , 
And all the Metaphors does spoil . 
4.  

In things , where Fancy much does reign , 
't is dangerous too cunningly to feign . 
The Play at last a Truth does grow , 
And Custom into Nature go . 
By this cursed art of begging I became 
Lame with counterfeiting Lame . 
5.  

My Lines of amorous desire 
I wrote to kindle and blow others fire : 
And 't was a barbarous delight 
My Fancy promiseed from the sight ; 
But now , by Love , the mighty Phalaris , I 
My burning Bull the first do try . 
The Inconstant . 

1.  

I Never yet could see that face 
Which had no dart for me ; 
From fifteen years to fifties space 
They all victorious be . 
Love thou 'rt a Dev'ill ; if I may call thee One , 
For sure in Me thy name is Legion . 
2.  

Colour , or Shape , good Limbs , or Fate , 
Goodness or Wit in all I find . 
In Motion or in Speech a grace , 
If all fail , yet 't is Womankind ; 
And I 'm so weak , the Pistol need not be 
Double or triple charged to murder Me . 
3.  

If Tall , the Name of Proper slays ; 
If fair , she 's pleasant as the Light ; 
If Low , her Prettiness does please ; 
If Black , what Lover love's not Night ? 
If yellow haired , I Love , lest it should be 
th' excuse to others for not loving Me . 
4.  

The Fat , like Plenty , fills my heart ; 
The Lean , with Love makes me too so , 
If Straight , her body 's Cupid's Dart 
To me , if Crooked , 't is his Bow. 
Nay Age itself does me to rage incline , 
And strength to Women gives , as well as Wine . 
5.  

Just half as large as Charity 
My richly-landed love 's become ; 
And judged aright is Constancy , 
Though it take up a larger room : 
Him , who love's always one , why should they call 
more Constant , than the Man love's Always All ? 
6.  

Thus with unwearied wings I flee 
Through all Love's Gardens and his Fields ; 
And , like the wise industrious Bee , 
no Weed , but Honey to me yields ! 
Honey still spent this diligence still supplies , 
Though I return not home with laden Thighs . 
7.  

My Soul at first instead did prove 
Of pretty strength against a Dart , 
Till I this Habit got of Love ; 
But my consumed and wasted Heart 
Once burned to Tinder with a strong Desire , 
Since that by every Spark is set on Fire . 
The Constant.  

1.  

Great , and wise Conqueror , who where ere 
thou comest , dost fortify , and settle there ! 
Who caused defend as well as get ; 
And never hadst one Quarter beaten up yet ; 
Now thou art in , thou ne'er wilt part 
With one inch of my vanquished Heart : 
For since thou tookest it by assault from Me , 
't is garrisoned so strong with thoughts of Thee , 
It fears no beauteous Enemy . 
2.  

Had thy charming strength been less , 
I 'had served ere this an hundred Mistresses . 
I 'm better thus , and would compound 
To leave my Pris'on to be a Vagabound . 
A Pris'on in which I still would be , 
Though every door stood open to Me , 
In spite both of thy Coldness and thy Pride , 
All Love is Marriage on thy Lover's side , 
For only Death can them divide . 
3.  

Close Narrow Chain , yet soft and kind , 
As that which Spir'its above to good does bind ! 
Gentle and sweet Necessity , 
Which does not force , but guide our Liberty ! 
Your Love on Me were spent in vain , 
Since my Love still could but remain 
Just , as it is ; for what alas can be 
Added to that which hath Infinitie 
Both in Extent and Quality . 
Her Name . 

1.  

With more than jewish Reverence as yet 
Do I the Sacred Name conceal ; 
When , ye kind Stars , ah when will it be fit 
His Gentle Myst'ery to reveal ? 
When will our Love be Named , and we possess 
That Christening as a Badge of Happiness ? 
2.  

So bold as yet no verse of mine has been 
To wear that Gem on any Line ; 
Nor , till the happy Nuptial Muse be seen , 
Shall any Stanza with it shine . 
Rest mighty Name , till then ; for thou must be 
Laid down : by her , ever taken up by Me . 
3.  

then all the fields and woods shall with it ring ; 
then Echoes burden it shall be ; 
then all the Birds in several notes shall sing , 
And all the Rivers murmur Thee ; 
then ever'y wind the Sound shall upwards bear , 
And softly whisper 't to some Angels Eare.  
4.  

then shall thy Name through all my Verse be spread , 
Thick as the flowers in Meadowsly , 
And , when in future times they shall be read , 
( As sure , I think , they will not die ) 
If any Critic doubt that they be mine , 
Men by that Stamp shall quickly know the Coin . 
5.  

Mean while I will not dare to make a Name 
To represent thee by , 
Adam ( God's Nomenclator ) could not frame 
One that enough should signify . 
Astraea'or Caelia as unfit would prove 
For Thee , as 't is to call the Di'ety Jove . 
Weeping . 

1.  

See where she sits , and in what comely wise 
Drops Tears more fair than others Eyes : 
Ah , charming Maid , let not ill Fortune see 
th' attire thy sorrow wears , 
Nor know the beauty of thy Tears ; 
For she 'll still come to dress herself in Thee . 
2.  

As stars reflect on waters , so I soye 
In every drop ( me thinks her Eye . 
The Baby , which lies there , and always plays 
In that illustrious sphere , 
Like a Narcissus does appear , 
Whilst in his flood the lovely Boy did gaze . 
3.  

Near yet did I behold so glorious weather , 
As this Sunshine and Rain together . 
Pray Heaven her Forehead , that pure Hill of Snow 
( For some such Fountain we must find 
To waters of so fair a kind ) 
Melt not , to feed that beauteous stream below . 
4.  

Ah , mighty Love , that it were inward Heat 
Which made this precious Lymbeck sweat ! 
But what , alas , ah what does it avail 
That she weeps Tears so wondrous cold 
As scarce the Ass' hoof can hold , 
So cold , that I admire they fall not Hail . 
Discretion . 

1.  

Discreet ? what means this word Discreet ? 
A Curse on all Discretion ! 
This barbarous term you will not meet 
In all Love's Lexicon . 
2.  

Jointure , Portion , Gold , Estate , 
Houses , Householdstuff , or Land , 
( The Low Conveniences of Fate ) 
Are Greek no Lovers understand . 
3.  

Believe me , beauteous one , when Love 
Enters into a breast , 
The two first things it doth remove , 
Are Friends and Interest . 
4.  

passion 's half blind , nor can endure 
The careful , scrup'lous Eyes , 
Or else I could not love , I 'm sure ▪ 
One who in Love were wise . 
5.  

Men , in such tempests tossed about , 
Will without grief or pain , 
Cast all their goods and riches out , 
Themselves their Port to gain . 
6.  

As well might Martyrs , who do choose 
That sacred Death to take , 
more for the clothes , which they must lose , 
When they 're bound naked to the Stake . 
The Wayting-maide . ( Suspected to Love her . ) 

1.  

Thy Maid ? ah , find some nobler theme 
Whereon thy doubts to place ; 
Nor by a low suspect blaspheme 
The glories of thy face . 
2.  

Alas , she makes Thee shine so fair , 
So tightly bright , 
That her dim Lamp must disappear 
Before thy potent Light.  
3.  

Three hours each morn in dressing Thee 
Maliciously are spent ; 
And make that Beauty Tyranny , 
that 's else a Civil Government . 
4.  

The'adorning thee with so much art 
Is but a barb'arous skill ; 
't is like the poisoning of a Dart 
Too apt before to kill . 
5.  

The Min'istring Angels none can see ; 
't is not their beauty ' or face , 
For which by men thy worshipped be ; 
But their high office and their place ▪ 
thou art my Goddess , my Saint , She ; 
I pray to Her , only to pray to Thee . 
Council . 

1.  

AH ! what advice can I receive ? 
no , satisfy me first ; 
For who would Physic potions give 
To one that dies with Thirst ? 
2.  

A little puff of breath we find 
Small fires can quench and kill , 
But when they 're great , the adverse wind , 
Does make them greater still . 
3.  

Now whilst you speak , it moves me much ; 
But straight I 'm just the same ; 
Alas th' effect must needs be such 
Of Cutting through a Flame . 
The Cure.  

1.  

Come , Doctor , use thy roughest art 
thou canst not cruel prove ; 
Cut , burn , and Torture every part , 
To heal me of my Love.  
2.  

There is no danger if the pain 
Should me to a Fever bring ; 
Compared with Heats I now sustain , 
A Favour is so Cool a thing , 
( Like drink which feverish men desire ) 
That I should hope 't would almost quench my Fire . 
The separation . 

1.  

Ask me not what my Love shall do or be 
( Love which is Soul to Body , and Soul of Me ) 
When I am sepa'rated from thee ; 
Alas I might as easily show , 
What after Death the Soul will do ; 
'T will last , I 'm sure , and that is all we know . 
2.  

The thing called soul will never stir nor move , 
But all that while a liveless Carcase prove , 
For 't is the Body of my Love ; 
Not that my Love will fly away , 
But still continue , as , they say , 
Sad troubled Ghosts about their Graves do stray . 
The Tree . 

1.  

I Close the flour'ishingst Tree in all the Park , 
With freshest Boughs and fairest head ; 
I cut my Love into his gentle Bark , 
And in three days , behold , 't is dead ? 
My very written Flames so vi'olent be , 
They'have burned and withereed up the Tree . 
2 : 

How should I live myself , whose Heart is found , 
Deeply graved every where 
With the large History of many a wound , 
Larger than thy Trunk can bear ? 
With art as strange , as Homer in the Nut , 
Love in my Heart has Volumes put . 
3.  

What a few words from thy rich stock did take 
The Leaves and Beauties all ? 
As a strong Poison with one drop does make 
The Nails and Hairs to fall : 
Love ( I see now ) a kind of Witchcraft is , 
For Characters could ne'er do this . 
4.  

Pardon ye Birds and Nymphs who loved this Shade ; 
And pardon me , thou gentle Tree ; 
I thought her name would thee have happy made , 
And blessed Omens hoped from Thee ; 
Notes of my Love , thrive here ( said I ) and grow ; 
And with ye let my Love do so . 
5.  

Alas poor youth , thy love will never thrive ! 
This blasted Tree predestines it ; 
Go tie the dismal Knot ( why shouldst thou live ? 
And by the Lines thou there hast written 
Deform'dly hanging , the sad Picture be 
To that unlucky History . 
Her Unbelief . 

1.  

't is a strange kind of Ignorance this in you ! 
That you your Victories should not spy , 
Victories gotten by your Eye ! 
That your bright beams , as those of Comets do , 
Should kill , but not know How , nor Who.  
2.  

That truly you my Idol might appear , 
Whilst all the People smell and see 
The odorous flames , I offer thee , 
thou sittest , and dost not see , nor smell , nor hear 
Thy constant zealous worshipper . 
3.  

They see 't too well who at my fires repine ; 
Nay th' ' unconcerned themselves do prove 
Quick-eyed enough to spy my Love ; 
Nor does the Cause in thy Face clearelier shine , 
then the Effect appears in mine . 
4.  

Fair Infidel ! by what unjust decree 
Must I , who with such restless care 
Would make this truth to thee appear , 
Must I , who preach it , and pray for it , be 
Damned by thy incredulity ? 
2.  

I by thy Unbelief am guiltless slain ; 
O have but Faith , and then that you 
May know that Faith for to be true , 
It shall itself by'a Miracle maintain , 
And raise me from the Dead again . 
3.  

Mean while my Hopes may seem to be o'erthrown ▪ 
But Lovers Hopes are full of Art , 
And thus dispute , that since my Heart 
Though in thy Breast , yet is not by thee known , 
Perhaps thou may'st not know thine Own . 
Love given over . 

1.  

IT is enough ; enough of time , and pain 
Hast thou consumed in vain ; 
Leave , wretched Cowley , leave 
Thyself with shadows to deceive ; 
Think that already lost which thou must never gain . 
2.  

Three of thy lustiest and freshest years , 
( Post in storms of Hopes and Fears ) 
Like helpless Ships that be 
Set on fire i' th' midst o' the Sea , 
Have all been burned in Love , & all been drowned in Tears . 
1.  

Resolve then on it , and by force or art 
Free thy unlucky Heart ; 
Since Fate does disapprove 
th' ambition of thy Love , 
And not one Star in heaven offers to take thy part . 
4.  

If ere I clear my Heart from this desire , 
If ere it home to'his breast retire , 
It ne'er shall wander more about , 
Though thousand beauties called it out : 
A Lover Burned like me for ever dreads the fire . 
5.  

The Poet , the Plague , and every small disease , 
May come as oft as ill Fate please ; 
But Death and Love are never found 
To give a Second Wound , 
we 're by those Serpent's bit , but wee'redevoured by these . 
6.  

Alas , what comfort is (null) (null) that I am grown ▪ 
Secure of being again o'erthrown ; 
Since such an Enemy needs not fear 
Lest any else should quarter there , 
Who has not only Sacked , but quite burned down the Town . 
TO THE READER . 

IN stead of the Author's Picture in the beginning , I thought sit to fix here this following Copy of Verses , being his own illustration of his Motto , and ( as I conceive ) the more lively representation of him . 

Tentanda vita est qua me quoque possim 
Tollere humo victorque virûm volitare per ora . 
What shall I do to be for ever known , 
And make the Age to come my own ? 
I shall like Beasts or Common people die , 
Unless you write mine Elegy ; 
While others great by being born are grown ; 
Their Mothers Labour not their own . 
In this Scale Gold , in th' other Fame does lie ; 
The weight of that mounts this so high . 
These men are fortunes Jewels , moulded bright ; 
Brought forth with their own fire and light . 
If I , her vulgar stone , for either look ; 
Out of myself it must be struck . 
Yet I must on ; what sound is (null) (null) strikes mine ear ? 
Sure ay Fame's Trumpet hear . 
It sounds like the last Trumpet ; for it can 
Raise up the buried Man 
Unpassed Alps stop me , but I 'll cut through all ; 
And march , the Muses Hannibal . 
Hence all ye flattering Vanities that lay 
Nets of Roses in the way . 
Hence the desire of Honours or Estates ; 
And all , that is not above Fate . 
Hence Love himself , that Tyrant of my days , 
Which intercepts my coming Praise . 
Come my best Friends , my Books , and lead me on ; 
't is time that I were gone . 
Welcome great Stagirite , and teach me now 
All I was born to know . 
Thy Scholar's Vict'ories thou dost far outdo ; 
He conquered th'earrh , the whole World you . 
Welcome learned Cicero , whose blessed Tongue and Wit 
Preserves Rome's Greatness yet . 
thou art the first of Or'atours , only he 
Who best can praise thee , next must be . 
Welcome the Mantuan Swan , Virgil the wise ; 
Whose Verse walks highest , but not flies , 
Who brought green Po'esie to her perfect age ; 
And mad'st that Art , which was a Rage . 
Tell me , ye mighty Three , what shall I do 
To be like one of you ? 
But you have climbed the Mountain's top , there sit 
On the calm flourishing head of it , 
And whilst with wearied steps we upward go , 
See us , and Clouds below .
