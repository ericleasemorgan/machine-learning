The Northamptonshire Lover , or a pleasant Dialogue between a Northamptonshire Gentleman and a Merchant's daughter of London . 

To the tune of Falero lero lo.  


Thou sweetest of complexion , 
whose beauty doth entice : 
My heart lives in subjection , 
My love did it surprise : 
Let only this suffice , 
thy virtues I do know , 
Which maketh me to love thee , 
Fa lero lero lo.  
Wert thou not so regardless , 
of my most kindly offer , 
And Maydenlike rewardlesse , 
wouldst entertain my proffer , 
M● Father's richest coffer , 
on thee I would bestow , 
For still me thinks I love thee : 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Of all my Predecessors , 
I am the only heir , 
That ●ieth in North-hampton-shire , 
that country rich and fair : 
Yet how soe'er I fare , 
my love shall not be stow : 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
My Father being deceased , 
mark but my store of land , 
Which were my love appeased , 
should be at thy command : 
Do not my love withstand , 
and thou my state shalt know : 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Three hundred goodly Acres , 
of fallow Land is mine , 
With threescore five half Acres , 
which next to them do join : 
For rood's and part of fetches , 
I have as many mother , 
Yet thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Unsowne doth lie so much more , 
from weeds and thistles clear : 
Which cause shall be more fruitful , 
is kept until next year : 
Wouldst thou embrace thy Dear , 
all this thou shouldst have too , 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Full fifty head of goodly kine , 
my father free doth keep , 
Three goodly team of Horses , 
and full three thousand sheep : 
Beside his swine and poultry , 
then let not love be slow , 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
His tenements are many , 
built strong of lime and stone , 
In North-hampton standeth six , 
my father calls his own : 
then let thy love be shown , 
to him that woos thee so , 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo , 
What is it then doth cause me , 
of thee to be rejected , 
My body hath by beauteous maids , 
been oftentimes affected : 
Yet I all love rejected , 
till thee I once did know : 
Thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Dear sweet regard my wounded heart , 
struck by the God of love ● 
Which until I obtain thee , 
I know will ne'er remove : 
then grant me love for love , 
on me thy love bestow : 
For thy virtues makes me love thee , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Fond man leave off thy wooing , 
for I thy love do eat , 
Dost think a Merchant's daughter , 
by words so soon is wone : 
Maids have been oft undone , 
by men's most flattering show , 
men's vices makes me hate thee , 
To love I cry no no.  
Men friendly seem to woe us , 
when false they are in heart , 
Intending to undo us , 
and so from us to part : 
Would all had their deserts , 
that prove to maidens so , 
men's vices makes me hate thee , 
To love I cry no , no.  
The Second part , To the same tune . 


For all thy father's riches , 
I do not weigh a straw : 
Young heirs oft spend their coffers , 
in riot , pride , and law . 
Since first thy face I saw , 
my love to thee was slow : 
men's vices makes me hate thee , 
To love I cry no , no.  
My father is as rich at Sea , 
as thine is on the land , 
Three goodly ships with Merchandise 
do float at his command : 
On wealth I do not stand , 
enough doth need no mother , 
men's vices makes me hate thee , 
To love I cry no , no.  
Besides within the City here , 
full plainly may be found : 
His Shop and full stuffed Warehouses 
worth many a hundred pound . 
Which doth to me redound , 
but yet I wish not so , 
men's vices makes me hate thee , 
To love I cry no , no.  
Uariety of Gallants , 
make show of love to me . 
Who of me shall be slighted , 
just as I now slight thee : 
My dowry shall procure a man , 
whom firm in mind I know , 
But yet my love 'gainst all shall stand 
To love I cry no , no.  
You men in minds are fickle , 
ye love but by the hour , 
A maid may find a young man kind , 
who instantly will lower , 
In all things men untrue do prove , 
in promise they are slow : 
Therefore I 'll bid adieu to love , 
And still will cry no , no.  
But if I chance to match wi●h man 
North-hamptonshire I 'll choose : 
Because of mind those men are kind , 
the rest I will refuse . 
North-hamtonshire to London , 
was helper in her woe , 
Which is the cause I love them , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
Which when this lusty gallant heard 
he seemed away to part : 
Pretending thereo● for to try , 
the temper of her heart . 
For whether tongue and mind agreed 
by this he thought to know , 
And yet in heart he loved her . 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
The Damsel this perceiving , 
and noting his behaviour : 
Thought fit to entertain him , 
possessed of all her favour : 
Which he enjoyed with full consent . 
so unto Church they go , 
Where he espoused the maid he loved , 
Fa lero , lero lo.  
The fathers of these couple , 
death took into his hands , 
And they were full possessed , 
of all their goods and lands : 
They lived in prosperity , 
may all young men do so . 
Let men and Maids remember this , 
love creeps whered cannot go . 
FINIS .
