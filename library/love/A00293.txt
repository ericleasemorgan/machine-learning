A most sweet Song of an English Merchant , born at Chichester . 

To an excellent new Tune . 



A Rich Merchant man , 
That was both grave and wise , 
Did kill a man at E●●den Town , 
Through quarrels that did rise . 
Through quarrels that did rise , 
The Germane he was dead , 
And for this fact the Merchant man 
was judged to lose his head . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
A Scaffold builded was , 
Within the Marketplace , 
And all the people far and near , 
Did thither flock apace . 
Did thither flock apace , 
This doleful sight to see , 
Who , all in velvet black as jet , 
unto the place came he , 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
Bareheaded was he brought , 
His hands were bound before , 
A Cambric Ruff about his neck , 
As white as milk he wore : 
His Stockings were of silk , 
As fine as fine might be 
Of person , and of countenance , 
a proper man was he . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
When he was mounted up , 
Upon the Scaffold high , 
All women said great pity 't was , 
So sweet a man should die . 
The Merchants of the Town , 
From death to set him free , 
Did proffer there two thousand pound , 
but yet it would not be . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
The Prisoner hereupon , 
began to speak his mind , 
Quoth he , I have deserved death , 
In conscience I do find : 
Yet sore against my will , 
This man I killed , quoth he , 
As Christ doth know , which of my soul 
must only Saviour be . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
With heart I do repent 
This most unhappy deed ; 
And for his wife and children small , 
My very soul doth bleed : 
This deed is done and passed , 
My hope of life is vain , 
And yet the loss of this my life , 
to them is little gain . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
Unto the widow poor , 
And her two Babes therefore , 
I give a hundred pound a piece , 
Their comfort to restore : 
Desiring at their hands , 
no one request but this , 
They will speak well of English●●● 
though I have done amiss . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
This was no sooner sp●ke● 
But that to stint his grief , 
Ten goodly Maids did proffer him , 
For love to beg his life : 
This is our law , quoth they , 
We may your death remove , 
If you in lieu of our good will , 
will grant to us your love . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
Brave Englishman , quoth one , 
't is I will beg thy life : 
Nay , quoth the second , it is I , 
If I must be thy wife : 
't is I , the third did say ; 
Nay , quoth the fourth , 't is I : 
So each one after other said , 
still waiting his reply . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
The second Part , To the same tune . 

Fair Maidens all , quoth he , 
I must confess and say , 
That each of you full worthy is , 
To be a Lady gay : 
And I unworthy far , 
The worst of you to have , 
Though you have offered willingly 
my loathed life to save . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
then take a thousand thanks 
Of me a dying man : 
But speak no more of love nor life , 
For why , my life is gone . 
To Christ my love I give , 
My body unto death : 
For none of you my heart can love , 
though I do lose my breath . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
Fair Maids lament no more , 
Your Country Law is such , 
It takes but hold upon my life , 
My goods it cannot touch : 
Within one chest I have 
In gold a thousand pound , 
I give it equal to you all , 
for love which I have found . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
And now dear friends farewell , 
Sweet England eke adieu , 
And Chicester where I was born , 
Where first this breath I drew . 
And now thou man of death , 
Unto thy weapon stand : 
Ah nay another Damsel cried , 
sweet Headsman hold thy hand . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
Now hear a Maiden's plaint , 
Brave Englishman , quoth she , 
And grant her love for love again , 
That craves but love of thee : 
I woo and sue for love , 
That have been wooed ere this , 
then grant me love , and therewithal 
she proffers him a kiss . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
And die within mine arms , 
If thou wilt die , quoth she ; 
Yea live or die sweet Englishman , 
I 'll live and die with thee . 
But can it be , he said , 
That thou dost love me so : 
't is not by long acquaintance sir , 
whereby true love doth grow . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
then beg my life , quoth he , 
And I will be thine own ; 
If I should seek the world for love , 
more love cannot be shown . 
The people on that word , 
Did give a joyful cry , 
And said , it had great pity been , 
so sweet a man should die 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
I go my Love , she said , 
I run , I fly for thee ; 
And gentle Headsman spare a while , 
My Lover's life for me : 
Unto the Duke she went , 
Who did her grief remove ; 
And with an hundred Maidens more , 
she went to fetch her Love.  
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
With music sounding sweet , 
The foremost of the train , 
This gallant Maiden like a Bride , 
Did fetch him back again : 
Yea hand in hand they went 
Unto the Church that day , 
And they were married presently 
in sumptuous rich array . 
A sweet thing is love , etc.  
To England came he then , 
With this his lovely Bride , 
A fairer woman never lay 
By any Merchant's side : 
Where I must leave them now , 
In pleasure and delight ; 
But of their name and dwelling place , 
I must not here recite . 
A sweet thing is love , 
It rules both heart and mind ; 
There is no comfort in the world 
to women that are kind . 
FINIS .
