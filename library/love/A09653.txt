Aristoxenus' ( thrice noble Lord ) held that the Soul of man was Music : But that the being thereof was framed of Bumbees , as the Pithagorians affirm : But for that it is the subject and object of all harmonical concents : Intimating hereby the dignity and high renown of that Art , which descended from so noble a stem , seeketh by all means possible to nobilitate the same , and that man to be unfit for the society and commerce of men , that honoureth not so worthy a Jewel for the life of man Which opinion verily is worthy Aristoxenus , that is to say , a noble Philosopher , yet how little squaring with the time , experience a perfect Mistress of truth hath a long time taught . For who regardeth the melodius charms of Orpheus , or enchanting melody of Arion ? surely but a few , Quos aequus amavit jupiter dijs geniti , aut ardeus evexit ad aethera virtus . Of which rank seeing your Lordship hath given undoubted testimonies of your honour to be one : Musicians should commit an undiscreet part of ingratitude not to acknowledge so great a favour . For mine own part ( who an meanest of many which profess this divine skill , though not meanest in good will & humble affection to your Honour ) I must confess myself many ways obliged to your Lordship's family , not only , for that my Father and Brother received many graces of your Honours noble Father , whom they followed , but that myself had the like of your most honourable Brother , even from the first notice he chanced to take of me . And therefore ( most honourable Lord ) I have here presented this oblation , howsoever mean , a token of mine affectionate good will Love , yea only devoted to your Lordship , which if it may gain your gracious acceptation , will fear neither Zoilus nor Momus his reprehension . 

Your Honours in all duty

2 

Change they their choice , to whose delicious sense , 
The strangest objects are of most esteem : 
Inconstant liking may find excellence , 
In things which ( being not good ) yet best do seem . 
Let gallant bloods still crown their sports with joy , 
Whom honour , wealth , and pleasure fills : 
Let sweet contentment never find annoy , 
While Fortune frames things to their wills . 
This stirs not me , I am the same , I was before . 
My choice is made , and I desire to change no more . 
3 

Be my choice blamed , or be I thought unwise , 
To hold my choice , by others not approved , 
I say , that to myself I fall or rise , 
By fear , or force I cannot be removed . 
Let friends in pity doubt of my success , 
Their pity gets no thanks at all : 
Let foes be glad to see my hopes grow less , 
I scorn the worst that wish they shall : 
Still stand I firm , my hart is set , and shall remain , 
My choice is made , and never will I change again .

The time hath been , when I was bet - ter graced : I now the same , and yet that time is past . 

Is it because that thou art only fair , 
O no such graceful looks banish disdain , 
How then , to feed my passions with despair , 
Feed on sweet love , so I be loved again . 
Well may thy public scorn , and outward pride , 
Inward affections , and best like hide . 
Breath but a gentle air , and I shall live , 
Smile in a cloud , so shall my hopes renew , 
One kind regard , and second seeing give , 
One rising Morn , and my black woes subdue . 
If not , yet look upon the friendly Sun , 
That by his beams , my beams to thine may run .

Mounting yet if she do call , 
And desire to know thy arrant : 
Fear not stay , and tell her all , 
Falling she will be thy warrant . 
3 

Rise , o rise , but rising tell , 
When her beauty bravely wins thee , 
T'sore up where that she doth dwell , 
Down again thy baseness brings thee . 
4 

If she ask what makes thee love her , 
Say her virtue , not her face : 
For though beauty doth approve her , 
Mildness gives her greater grace . 
5 

Rise then rise if she bid rise , 
Rising say thou risest for her : 
Fall if she do thee despise , 
Falling still do thou adore her . 
6 

If thy plaint do pity gain , 
Love and live to her honour : 
If thy service she disdain , 
Dying yet complain not on her .

Wherein , whereon touched equal with love's fire , 
We reaped of either other loves desire , 
Whither the twining plants that thee enclose . 
O be thy bowers still filled with serpent's hisses , 
That sought by treason , to betray our kisses . 
Torn be the frame , for thou didst thankless hide , 
A traitorous spy , her brother , and my foe , 
Who sought by death , our joys to under go , 
And by that death , our passions to divide , 
Leaving to our great vows , eternal woe .

I hate my tears which drop , and dry , quench and friâ the same : 
I hate the hart which frozen burns , I hate the hart which chosen turns , 
Too and from me , making of me nothing but a game .

My thoughts are fuel to desire , which my hart doth move , 
My tears are oil to feed the fire , smart whereof I prove : 
She laughs at sighs that come from me , I sigh at laughs in her so free , 
Who doth glory , in the story of my sorry love .

Her lovely looks , and lovelesse mind do not well agree , 
Her quick conceit , and judgement blind , as ill suited be : 
Her forward wit , and froward hart , that like to knit , this glad to part , 
Makes so pretty , and so witty , not to pity me .

The more I seek , the less I find what to trust unto , 
The more I hold , the less I bind , she doth still undo : 
I wove the web of idle love , which endless will , and frutles prove , 
If the pleasure for the measure of my treasure go .

Whilst love in deed and word , most faihfull did appear : 
False semblance came in place , by selocie attended , 
And with a double face , both love and fancy blended , 
Which made the gods forsake , and men from fancy fly , 
And maidens scorn a mate , forsooth and so will 1

When fond imagination , 
Seemed to see , but could not tell ,

And sometime fall aweeping :

As when I feel a sleeping .

First formed words all , & fairly it combined , combined by love .
