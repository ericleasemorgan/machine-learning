SPIRITUAL HYMNS UPON SOLOMON'S SONG : OR , Love in the right Channel . Wherein that Divine Part of Scripture is Paraphrased , and the dark Places expounded ; and may be vocally Sung in the Ordinary Tunes of the Singing Psalms . By JOHN REEVE . 

I will sing to my well-beloved , a song of my beloved , touching his Vineyard , 

Isa 5. 1.  

Teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms , and Hymns , and spiritual Songs , singing with Grace in your hearts unto the Lord , 

Col. 3. 16.  

And they sung the song of Moses , and the song of the Lamb , 

rev. 15. 3.  

LONDON : Printed for the Author , and are to be Sold by John Hancock Senior , at the three Bibles , at the corner of Popes-head Alley , over against the Royal Exchange . 1684.  

To the chaste and pure Virgin-souls , that love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity , Grace and Peace be multiplied . 

I 

These Hymns were most composed in the dark , 
When restless hours interrupted sleep : 
With a design to stop that rambling work , 
Ungoverned fancy useth then to keep . 
Better make Hymns than yield to Melancholy , 
Or take the World to govern by a thoughtful folly . 
II  

Hands off you venomous Creatures ; you that draw 
The rankest Poison from the sweetest flowers : 
Yea , that by Rigour of a lustful Law , 
Would force Divine love to conform to yours . 
I fear , if you should light upon this Book ; 
you 'd force it from itself , and like a lovesong look . 
III  

But if you do , our Loves are still Divine ; 
The stinking Dunghills can't put out the Sun : 
While you sing out your shame , we will incline 
To sing the Praise of God's eternal Son. 
We will in Psalms and Hymns , and Spiritual Song , 
Outsing the Mirth obscene , which unto you belongs . 
iv.  

Come then you Virgin ▪ Spouses of the Lamb , 
Join consort with the Holy ones above : 
Put off the Clog , your Body , if you can , 
And melt yourselves into a Mass of Love. 
Out with the dregss , and draw the Spirits higher , 
Let Love be Love Divine , and not a lustful Fire . 
v.  

I have lived out now , more than threescore years , 
And never yet could find my heart in tune 
For such a Work as this ; it plain appears , 
Love's hard to be refined ! OH , how soon , 
Returns the dregss and smut ! the strength of Grace 
And Age's weakness , both at work , take little place . 
VI  

Nor had this been exposed to public view , 
But that the Child was drawn by Cogent hand : 
'T was hard to trust it , when there are so few 
chaste Eyes , and pure Minds , abroad the land . 
But let it take the Covert of the wings 
Of Him , whose work it is ; of Him , whose praise it sings . 
CANT . I 1.  

The Song of Songs , which was Solomons . 

HYMN 1.  

'T Was Solomon's Song , but now 't is mine : 
't is yours , you blessed Saints on high : 
You Mil'tants come and make your claim ; 
All you that are athirst , draw nigh . 
This Song of Songs , and Hymns of praise ; 
Sweet Jesus at thy feet we lay , 
Together with our Hearts and Souls , 
And for acceptance humbly pray . 
King Solomon shan't Praise thee alone , 
Nor singly sing his part in this : 
we 'll Praise thee too , because that thou 
Our Jesus art , as well as his . 
Strike up you blessed Angels , Tune 
Your Music to the highest Key ; 
You separated Souls in bliss , 
Sing forth his Praise ( as well you may ) . 
How precious is this Song of Songs , 
Where Christ himself concerned is , 
And sings the Praises of his Church , 
As they 're concerned in singing His ! 
Come blessed Spirit of our God , 
Inflame our hearts with heavenly fire ; 
W'el sing our parts : O! raise our hearts 
And Tune them yet a great deal high'r . 
CANT . I 2.  

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his Mouth : 

HYMN 2.  

Let those inam'ring Lips of thine , 
With Love-begetting Love ; 
Seal Kisses on these Lips of mine , 
That I may taste and prove , 
What those immense Treasures of Love , 
Those Seas and Oceans be : 
Let sacred Love flow from above , 
In Nectar streams to me . 
And let me kiss those Kisses , which 
Can raise my Heart on high , 
And love that Love , that can enrich 
And crown my Poverty . 
But will renowned Jesus deign 
To kiss so vile a Sinner , 
And be of undeserved Love , 
The Author and Beginner ! 
Can filthy Lips , and so unclean , 
Expect a Prince his Kiss ! 
Do Kings embrace a Love so mean ! 
Was ever Love like this ! 
He that could kiss the bitter Cross , 
And kiss the burning Wrath , 
And kiss the Breath of direful Death , 
A Kiss for Sinners hath ! 
CANT . I 2.  

— For his Love is better than Wine — 

HYMN 3  

Lord ! I esteem thy precious Love , 
And prise it more than richest Wine , 
There is no Cordial can remove 
My fainting , like that Blood of thine . 
Wine spills the man that drinks too much , 
And greatly doth his Health impair ; 
But those that drink the most of Love , 
The temperatest persons are . 
The Wine is not the poor Man's Drink ; 
But here 's a Cellar always free : 
The Rich may come , and poorest Saint 
May drink his fill , as well as Herald 
There was no Wine at Cana's feast , 
Was once complained by them above ; 
But such a word shall never be said , 
At Sion's Feast there is no Love. 
My Soul ! pierce thou this pipe of Love , 
Fill all thy Flagons to the Brim ; 
Divine excess is soberness , 
And Holy Drunkenness no Sin. 
The Wine that with us best agrees , 
And curious Palates most approve , 
Is not without unpleasing lees : 
But o ! there is no dregss in Love. 
Love's All that can be spoken or thought ; 
't is all Earth hath , or Heaven above . 
Epitomise a Deity , 
The total sum of all is LOVE . 
— For his Love is better than Wine . 

HYMN 4.  

Love me , my dearest Jesus , love me , 
And shed that Love , and let me see 
A Letter written full of Love , 
And superscribed unto me . 
OH love my Soul , and love me more , 
Although I know no reason why : 
Let me experience where that great 
Magnetic power of Love doth lie . 
Thy love 's a flood to quench the Flame● 
Of all my burning base Desires : 
Thy love 's a Flame to drink the floo 
Of Vanity , my heart aspires . 
Thy love 's a Corr'sive to my Sins ; 
Eats the proud Flesh from carnal heart : 
Thy love 's a Cordial to revive 
The fainting of the better part . 
Let Friends oppose , let Enemies rage ; 
Let Tyrants threaten Death appall : 
Let Hell and Devils do their worst , 
I 'll set thy Love against them all . 
Love me , my dearest Jesus , love me , 
And shed that Love , and let me see 
A Letter written full of Love , 
And superscribed unto me . 
CANT . I 3.  

Because of the savour of thy good ointments , thy name is as ointment poured forth : therefore do the virgins love thee . 

HYMN 5.  

How odoriferous are the scents 
Of thy Grace's Divine , 
Beyond all measure poured forth , 
Upon that Heart of thine ! 
no Garden flowers , no Spices , Lord ; 
no sweet perfumes that please , 
Not Aaron's Oil , nor Mary's Box , 
Smell half so sweet as these . 
Those Virgins next about thy Throne , 
Angels and Saints that smell , 
th' anointings of the holy One , 
And ' midst these Odours dwell ; 
Are always in Transports of Love , 
Have nothing else to do : 
Would I were there , that I with them 
Might learn to Love thee too . 
The Virgin-souls , whom thou art tuning , 
As strings to sound thy Praise ; 
Whose hearts with holy Oil perfuming , 
With whom 't is early days ; 
Initial converts new crept out 
The Womb of Grace's laws , 
Commence their Love , and Face about : 
OH how thy Ointments draws ! 
Pour on 't the anointings , Lord , and we 
Will wrap ourselves in sweet , 
And dwell amid the rich perfumes , 
There will we place our feet ; 
Thomas it be costly , spare no cost , 
OH spare , nor work , nor toil ; 
Thomas we have nothing else to give , 
we 'll give thee Love for Oil . 
CANT . I 4.  

Draw me , and we will run after thee — 

HYMN 6.  

With thy great Power draw me , Lord , 
And I to thee will come . 
With greater Power draw me , Lord , 
And I to thee will run . 
Draw me , and others I will draw , 
And we to thee will run ; 
Except thou drawest , our backward hearts 
To thee they 'll never come . 
When Jesus draws , he strongly draws , 
The flesh can't hold me back ; 
Nor all the pleasures of the World ; 
't is thee , 't is thee I lack . 
When Jesus draws , he sweetly draws , 
As Beasts by Fodder led ; 
As Lovers draw by Charms of Love , 
As Unions raise the Dead . 
The Loadstone draws the steely Mass , 
And none can tell us how ; 
So draw my steely Heart , my God , 
And make my Powers bow . 
Yea , drawn I am , I bless thee for 't , 
My Soul shall praise thee ever : 
OH Father , Son and Holy Ghost , 
My God , forsake me never . 
CANT . I 4.  

— The King brought me into his Chambers — 

HYMN 7.  

When fervent Love , with winged haste , 
To blessed Jesus fly's : 
With winged haste he comes as fast , 
With help and choice supplies : 
Let 's not his Church stand at the door , 
He sends no Servant down ; 
But down the stairs he comes himself , 
That King of great renown . 
His Person is the thing She seeks , 
His Person tends upon Her ; 
His Person is the thing She meets , 
His Person is Her honour . 
And up the Stairs he leads his Love ; 
Gives Her a Princely Treat ; 
With sp'ritual Nectar cheers Her heart , 
And Entertainments great . 
He seasts Her with his Chamber Love ; 
The best of all his store : 
She seeds upon his Flesh and Blood ; 
Her heart can wish no more : 
OH Lord ! thou art to me a dart : 
My wounded bleeding heart , 
Shall still impart her Lovesick Art , 
And never from thee start . 
CANT . I 4.  

— We will be glad and rejoice in thee — 

HYMN 8.  

GO , empty Joys , with all you toys : 
I have a better Joy than you : 
The Wine , the Mirth , the Music ▪ dance 
Doth but my precious Soul undo . 
The blessed Jesus hath vouchsafeed 
Upon the Mount my Soul to raise : 
Now I 'll exalt his Name and Fame , 
And to the Heavens raise his Praise . 
Let things go how they will below , 
Let Mountains duel with the Seas ▪ 
Let Hell her hottest Fires blow , 
My heart in Him shall take her ease . 
The merry Mirth which madness yields , 
Which worldly Men so fast devours ; 
Their pleasures and their drinking-hours ▪ 
Cannot afford such Mirth as ours . 
They cannot taste our Joys , OH Lord ; 
Nor can thy Saints more relish theirs : 
Our Joys will greater Joys afford : 
And theirs will end in bitter Tears : 
Therefore will we rejoice în thee : 
Our Joys shall feast upon thy store : 
When we are sad , we will be glad , 
And Praise thy Name for evermore . 
CANT . I 4.  

— We will remember thy Love more than Wine — 

HYMN 9  

Give place , ye Spirits of the Grape , 
That briskly fparkle in the Glass : 
there 's no such Wine as Love Divine ; 
OH , what a flavour Jesus has ! 
Were we possessed of East and West , 
And all the Joys of Heaven above : 
Treasures of both the Worlds : we will , 
Forgetting these , remember Love. 
Forgetfulness the fruit of Wine , 
But never was the fruit of Love ; 
The more I take , the more I make 
Impressions deep , and past remove . 
We cannot meet with Wine so sweet , 
Nor yet so pleasant to the taste , 
As drops of warm and bleeding Love , 
That trickle from his heart so fast : 
The Wine that from the Grape is pressed , 
In time will into sour turn ; 
But Love Divine will ever shine , 
With hottest Flames that always burn . 
The Wine is drawn , the vessel 's out , 
You cannot make it ever run : 
Whom Jesus love's , he love's as fresh , 
As if it were but now begun : 
thou God of our Salvation , 
Draw forth our Loves more unto thee : 
By loving us , teach us to Love , 
And thy beloved Spouse to be . 
CANT . I 4.  

— The upright love thee . 

HYMN 10.  

Thou art beloved , and best approved , 
Of all that are upright , 
Whose hearts are sound , sincerely bound ; 
thou art their chief delight : 
Whose very heart and souly part , 
Dwells with the Truth ; and when ▪ 
men's hearts are truly true to thee , 
As thou art true to them . 
Thomas Sinners scorn , and all forlorn , 
In their ungodly sight : 
Wretches they are , that would not care , 
To Love thee , if they might . 
The Hypocrite will speak thee fair , 
But hath no love within : 
Kiss ▪ and betray , like Judas they ; 
OH Lord , it is their Sin ! 
My Lord ! I love thee truly , though 
I Love not as I should : 
I love thee , yet I love thee not ; 
At least , not as I would : 
I would I could ; but since 't is so , 
Worms can but act as Worms ▪ 
Accept a real wish it were , 
A spark till Fire burns . 
CANT . I 5.  

I am black , but comely ( OH ye Daughts of Jerusalem ) as the tents of Kedar , and curtains of Solomon . 

HYMN 11.  

OH What a sorry thing am I , 
That cannot bear this weight of Love ! 
I 'm sunk , and down , and dead , as if 
Some dart had struck me from above . 
My Face is black because of Sin ; 
But yet am comely by his Grace : 
I 'm black without , but fair within : 
The scorching Sun hath tanned my Face . 
How black soever , Lord , I am ; 
Yet I am comely towards thee : 
OH mayst thou love ! and give me leave , 
Thy ardent Lover yet to be ▪ 
Thomas Sin and Sorrow makes me black , 
Like Kedar's Tents , that always lie 
Exposed to Wind and Air unkind , 
And inward wasting Misery . 
Yet Solomon's bed is not so fair , 
Nor are his Curtains half so bright , 
As I am , through his Grace , within , 
Comely in my Beloved's sight : 
ye Daughters of Jerusalem , 
Do not contemn me at this rate , 
Because of my deformity , 
And this my dark and gloomy state . 
For Love he can , although I am , 
Most undeserving of his Love ; 
And black as Hell , as if I were , 
As fair as is the Heaven above . 
CANT . I 6.  

Look not upon me , because I am black , for the Sun hath looked upon me . — 

HYMN 12.  

A Cloud may quickly overcast 
The brightest Sunny-day ; 
And through the sweetest Joys on Earth , 
Our tears can break their way . 
ye Daughters of Jerusalem , 
The Sun hath tanned my Face . 
Alas ! the Morphew that obtrudes 
Itself in Beauty's place ! 
Look not upon me , turn your Eyes : 
I am a loathsome sight 
To God and Angels , and myself ; 
In me is no delight : 
OH how I loathe myself , my God , 
To see this filthy sight ! 
OH how I long , though thus unclean , 
To love thee , if I might ! 
There is a sacrificed Lamb , 
Whose Blood can make me white . 
There is a Sun can wake the day , 
Out of this dismal Night : 
then shall my black be washed off ; 
then shall my Beauty shine ; 
Fair as the Morn ; though thus forlorn , 
Both in your Eyes and mine . 
CANT . I 6.  

— My mother's children were angry with me — 

HYMN 13.  

MY Mothers ( not my Fathers ) Sons ; 
Half brethren , Lord to me ; 
That claim a Kind'red of thy Church , 
But not akin to Thee : 
Sons of the Church create my woes , 
And cause me all this moan : 
They'd have me see by their blind Eyes , 
And quite put out my own . 
They have a way to fast and pray , 
Thy word doth not allow : 
And to their Modes of Worship false , 
They'd have my Conscience bow . 
The golden Image they set up , 
My Soul shall not adore . 
The fi'ry Furnance of their Wrath ; 
I 'll bear , and help implore . 
Awake , OH Christ , and me assist , 
And keep my heart within , 
True to thy Truth , thy Cause and thee , 
That nothing make me sin : 
I 'd better anger Men and Devils , 
that 's but a Creature wrath : 
Than by submitting to these evils , 
Try what thine Anger hath . 
CANT . I 6.  

— They made me keeper of the Vineyards — 

HYMN 14.  

Arise , OH ▪ Lord , some help afford ; 
To thee my Soul doth moan : 
I cannot hold , I must-unfold 
My grief to thee alone . 
  gotten Vineyards here and there , 
Exotic to thy Laws , 
Which by their force they 'll make me keep , 
From which my Soul withdraws . 
Their Figs are naught , their Grapes are sour , 
Their Vintage is not good : 
Their Winepress is to press the Saints ; 
Their Liquor is their blood . 
Head of the Church ! I pray thee let 
My heart be guided so , 
That I may yet their anger get , 
And make them more my foe ▪ 
  got a Vineyard strange to thee , 
no Scripture-rule must guide it ; 
And they 'd have me their slave to be : 
OH Lord ! I can't abide it . 
Be thou a keeper , Lord , to me , 
And I 'll be none of theirs ; 
And fortify my heart within , 
From all besieging fears : 
So will I Praise , and Trophies raise , 
For my Illustrious King ; 
And throw false Worship out of doors , 
As an accursed thing . 
CANT . I 6.  

— But mine own Vineyard I have not kept — 

HYMN 15.  

Alas ! when I with them comply , 
My Soul doth suffer loss : 
My Vine doth languish , and my Trees 
Are overgrown with Moss . 
My Graces they felt a decay , 
My Plants began to die ; 
My Conscience bled , my Joys were fled ; 
OH , what a Wretch was I ! 
●alse Worship is a canker-worm ; 
It Poisons all the Fruit : 
Unscripture-modes are Locusts all ; 
My Vineyard yet doth rue 't : 
' was never well with me and mine , 
Since thee and thine I slighted ; 
For fear of man , from thee I ran ; 
OH how I am benighted ! 
Let thy Commands and Laws , OH Christ , 
My Vineyard be to me : 
And next to them , OH let my Soul , 
My other Vineyard be : 
And let it be my great employ , 
To keep my Vineyards clean : 
So shall I rest , and be possessed 
Of Joys no Eye hath seen . 
CANT . I 7.  

Tell me ( OH thou whom my soul loveth ) where thou feedest , and where thou causest thy flocks to rest at noon : for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions ? 

HYMN 16.  

OH thou Beloved of my Soul ! 
Thomas hast a People free 
From all these mixtures , cleansed pure : 
OH tell me where they be ! 
thou hast thy Institutions , 
And Ordinances pure ; 
thou hast thy Churches : Tell me when , 
And where I may be sure . 
thou hast Enclosures rich and fat , 
Peculiar to thy Sheep ; 
And dainty nour'shing Pastures where 
thou dost them always keep . 
thou in Communion fold'st them up , 
In Winter keep'st them dry ; 
thou giv'st them shades from heat of Sun : 
OH tell me where they lie ! 
For why should I be led away 
By Creatures , in pretence ; 
And starve my soul , misled by such 
As come I know not whence ? 
OH tell me then , and bring me where , 
In this my greatest need , 
Thy Pastures and thy Pastors are ; 
And I with them will feed . 
CANT . I 8.  

If thou knowest not ( OH thou fairest among women ) go thy ways forth by the footsteps of the flocks , and feed thy kids beside the shepherd's tents . 

HYMN 17.  

OH thou my fairest one ! 
( Thus my beloved spoke ) 
If thou wouldst know what thou must do , 
And with my Saints partake . 
Go up to yonder Mount , 
Thence look , and thou shalt spy , 
Clear as the Sun , what must be done , 
Presented to thine Eye : 
Seest thou them folded Flocks , 
Whose heart the Spirit ties : 
Whom Gospel order calls into 
Distinct Societies ? 
Seest thou the Fields , where they 
Enjoy their heavenly feed ? 
The Shepherds stand at my command , 
To guide them at their need . 
Their Magna Charta is 
My Word ; my Law their Guide : 
OH follow them that follow me , 
Their foot shall never slide : 
There go , and join thyself ; 
Thy Soul there feed and feast ; 
follow their steps to Pastor's Tents , 
And there thy Soul shall rest . 
CANT . I 9  

I have compared thee , OH my love , to a company of horses in Pharoahs' chariots . 

HYMN 18.  

MY Church ! my Love ! I 'll now begin , 
TO express the Joy that I am in , 
And sing thy Praise as thou dost mine , 
And tell the World why I am thine . 
i  made thee fair , there 's no compare ; 
no worldly thing is such to me : 
King Pharoah's Charet-horses were 
A comely sight , but not like thee . 
When I behold their beauty , and 
Coupled in order as they stand ; 
I more admire and Praise those Unions , 
My Churches have in their Communions . 
Were Pharoah's trappingss bossed with Gold , 
As if they would outshine the Sun ? 
Much more the polish of thy Grace 
Shines ; that my heart is overcome . 
Did Pharoah's Horses prance along , 
And gladly draw his Charets on ? 
Such Service from thee I have found , 
As if thou didst not feel the ground . 
As Pharoah's Charets did exceed ; 
The best in all the world they be : 
Such is my Love , such is my Dove , 
The best in all the world to me . 
CANT . I 10.  

Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , thy neck with chains of gold . 

HYMN 19  

When Princes Daughters , in whose Veins 
The Royal blood doth run : 
Stand richly dressed in all their best , 
By art that can be done : 
My Church ! thy beauty far exceeds , 
Thy Glory far excels : 
My Love ! thou 'rt fairer than them all ; 
In thee all beauty dwells . 
When rows of Jewels beautify 
Their Face , and Cheeks adorn , 
To make thee fair in Prince's Eye , 
And welcome as the Morn . 
The Graces of my Church shine forth 
more lustr'ous , though but small : 
Methinks I see my Glory shine 
Upon their Faces all . 
When chains of Gold , the Necks enrich , 
Of mortal Beauties here : 
It draws their Eyes , who are not wise , 
And leads them to a snare : 
But happy they that can be caught 
With Zions Beauty so : 
And fall in Love , as I have done 
With Saints , and what they do . 
CANT . I 11.  

We will make thee borders of gold , with studs of silver . 

HYMN 20.  

WE , Father , Son and Holy Ghost , 
Will all in one conspire ; 
To stud the Glory of thy Face , 
And make thee All Desire . 
I 'll to my Father for supplies , 
And largely he 'll dispense : 
I 'll to the Holy Ghost also , 
And fetch thee riches thence . 
thou shalt partake of all my stores , 
My Heart , my Blood , and Me ; 
If what 's in Heaven , or Earth can do 't , 
we 'll give it all to thee . 
we 'll with most glorious Ornaments , 
Polish that heart of thine : 
Borders of Gold , and Silver studs , 
Shall make thy Glory shine : 
When all is done , 't is all too small 
A Present for my Love : 
I 'll give myself away also , 
And thou shalt live above 
All things but me ; for I 'll be Gold , 
Jewels , and every thing , 
And thou shalt live upon my stores , 
And loud my Praises sing . 
And then will we rejoice in thee , 
When we have made thee thus : 
then sin no more , ( as did before ) 
Shall break betwixt thee and us : 
My Soul admire this fervent Fire : 
Such Love no Tongue can tell : 
Who could have thought that Christ that bought 
Should Love his Church so well ! 
CANT . I 12.  

While the king sitteth at his table , my spikenard sends forth the smell thereof . 

HYMN 21.  

HOW rich and dainty is the fare , 
My blessed Love , and Lover dear , 
Provides for his beyond compare , 
And feasts them with his heavenly cheer ? 
The Cloth is laid , the Table spread , 
The Dainties are his Flesh and Blood : 
The welcome Guests are richly fed , 
And He himself becomes their Food . 
His Presence graces all the Feast ; 
His smile make welcome every Guest : 
He sits at Table with them , where 
His Saints are glad to meet Him there . 
His presence draws their Graces forth , 
Faith , Love , Joy , Patience , and the rest ; 
The smell whereof is better worth , 
Than Spikenard Ointments at the best . 
Thus Gardens yield their sweetest smells , 
When Rain and Sun extract them forth . 
Thus in his presence man excels , 
who 's in his absence little worth . 
My Soul ! thy King at Table sits ; 
Now let thy Spikenard-graces lend 
The sweet perfumes ; and pleasant scents 
Into his Nostrils largely send . 
CANT . I 13.  

A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved to me ; he shall lie all night between my breasts . 

HYMN 22.  

Tell me no more , you Sons of Art , 
You Students in the Case , 
What 't is will ease a Sick man's heart , 
And all his Grief displace : 
Jesus , when he doth please to be 
Refreshing from above ; 
How he transports me ! OH I feel , 
Myself all Fire and Love. 
The holy Oil was made of Myrrh : 
OH Christ anoint me so : 
Thy Body was embalmed with Myrrh ! 
OH Christ embalm me too ! 
And make me sweet , that I may greet 
A never dying Rest , 
And smell of thee , as if possessed , 
With Myrrh upon my breast ! 
There is a Night of darkness , when 
This Myrrh is Cordial : 
A Night of great Affliction , than 
This Myrrh is all in all ▪ 
OH let him lie between my breasts , 
And with his Love perfume me , 
And yield his heart-reviving Art ! 
This Night will else consume me . 
CANT . I 14.  

My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi . 

HYMN 23.  

OO me ! to me ! what comfort were 't , 
Or what refreshment could I see , 
If he were sweet to all the World , 
And were not also sweet to me ? 
I 'll sing my well ▪ beloved's Praise , 
And speak what he hath been to me : 
Engedi's Aromatic Vines , 
Have never been so sweet as Herald 
Clusters of Balsam Camphire were , 
In those same Vineyards past compare : 
Yet none so sweet , yet none so rare , 
As my Beloved's Odours are . 
How sweet was Christ upon the Cross , 
Making Atonement for my Sin ? 
Or else my Life had been my loss ▪ 
What a sad case had I been in ! 
How sweet was he within the Grave ? 
Himself , not spices made him so : 
How sweet a Bed shall I then have , 
When sleep with Jesus I shall go ! 
Blessed be the day that ever I smelled , 
What sweet in my Beloved was : 
Bless be the day that ere I felt , 
That sweetness my Beloved has : 
How sweet art thou in Heaven , where 
Angels and Saints perfumed are ? 
Amid that plenty grant there be , 
One cluster , Lord , laid up for me . 
CANT . I 15.  

thou art fair , my Love : behold , thou art fair , thou hast doves eyes . 

HYMN 24.  

Thou 'rt fair , my Love ! Lord , how can I be fair , thus foul with Sin ! 
thou 'rt fair , my Love : Lord , tell me why ▪ 
What transport art thou in ! 
I never an fair , but when there are , 
Reflections from thy Grace 
Darted upon me , from thy fair 
And most resplendent Face . 
thou art my Love : Lord , can it be , 
When I deserve thy fury , 
And highly merit , that thou me 
Shouldst in Oblivion bury ! 
Yet cause thy Love is like thyself , 
Too deep for human Eye : 
thou lov'st , because thou lov'st me , Lord , 
I know no reason why : 
thou hast Doves eyes so pure and chaste : 
Those Eye-beams draw my heart : 
In tears of godly sorrow washed : 
They shine like Stars in dark : 
Lord ! Is 't because they shall be so , 
When Glory makes them bright ? 
Or , is 't because they shine below , 
With my Redeemers light ? 
CANT . I 16.  

Behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant . 

HYMN 25.  

Nay , thou art fair , my Love , not I : 
Beauty keeps house in thee alone . 
There is no Sun , nor Moon , nor Stars , 
But thou art All and every One. 
Away fond Pleasures , fleeting Joys : 
Would I had never loved you so : 
You smiling , but beguiling Toys : 
i  got a wound , and you my foe . 
Come dearest Lord ! OH let me taste 
Of Pleasures that are more Divine : 
For those are gone , but these will last ; 
With these refresh this heart of mine . 
How pleasant are thy smiles , when I 
Under the guilt of Sin do lie ! 
When I damnation every hour 
Expect , how pleasant is thy power ! 
How pleasant are thy ways to me ! 
thine Ordinances all are so : 
To Eat and Drink , and Feast with thee , 
there 's no such pleasure I do know . 
But O! when I shall come to die , 
And see thy Face in endless bliss , 
And shall embrace the Man himself : 
There is no Pleasure like to this .

— Our bed is green . 

HYMN 26.  

Thou hast prepared a Bed of love ; 
't is richly furnished with the best : 
Where thou and I eternally , 
Shall in each others Bosom rest : 
Our Bed is always green ; it knows 
no Winter blasts , nor no such thing : 
it 's always budding , fruitful grows : 
An ever , everlasting Spring . 
When vain delights transport the Rich , 
And seem to court the Men of pleasure : 
they 're withered soon , and quickly gone , 
And fall full short in weight and measure . 
Give me those spiritual Joys , OH Christ ! 
Whose colour green , will ever last : 
And think on me , while here I be , 
And send me now and then a taste . 
My Soul revive ! comfort thy heart , 
' Midst all the trouble's thou had seen : 
Revive ! for though the Stairs be dark , 
The chamber 's light , our Bed is Green. 
All Glory give to God above , 
And to our Jesus , God and Man : 
And to the Holy Ghost also , 
With all the Strength and Praise we can .

Come let us sing the Praise 
Of our eternal House : 
Whose firm foundation is in Grace , 
Free Grace hath framed it thus : 
In Glory finished , 
Topstone in Glory laid , 
Rasters and Beams : eternal streams 
Of Love and Light displayed : 
Come let us enter , Grace , 
And here together dwell ; 
Till I provide a better place , 
Let 's rest us here a while . 
But , o , that house above , 
When thither we shall come ; 
it 's built so sure , it shall endure 
An everlasting home . 
wilt thou accept , OH Christ ! 
Of such a one as I ? 
Poor I ! to take a Lease of thee , 
For all Eternity ? 
wilt thou accept , said he , 
Of such a one as I , 
That must thy sinful will control ? 
Come then , we both comply .

I am the rose of Sharon , and the lily of the valleys . 

HYMN 28.  

Sharon , the Garden of the World , 
The Pride of Palestine ; 
Whose natural soil more glory bore , 
then Sol'mon could resign . 
could never produce so sweet a Rose , 
As I w ll be to thee : 
So sair a Lily never grew : 
Sharon must stoop to me . 
My Church , I praise myself ; not Pride , 
But hope of Custom makes me : 
who 'll have a Rose ? a Lily , who ? 
Where is the Soul that takes me ? 
Upon the Cross I was distilled : 
Come taste in distillation 
The sweetness of the absent Rose , 
By Faith and Acceptation . 
thou art my Rose , my Souls repose ; 
OH let me never be , 
My dearest Lord , a Thorn to thee , 
That art a Rose to me .

A matchless Purity . 
Let me be gathered by thy Hand , 
And in thy Bosom lie .

As the lily among the thorns , so is my love a-among the daughters .

MY Church ! my Love ! thou art to me , 
A pleasant Lily , pure and white : 
The Daughters all , compared to thee , 
Are Thorns and Briars in my sight . 
't is thee I prise , and singly place 
My heart upon thyself alone : 
False Creatures , though I have their face , 
Are pricking Briars every one . 
Take it not ill , my Love , from me , 
That I have placed thy dwelling so , 
Encompassed round where Enemies be : 
As midst the thorns the Lilies grow . 
I 'll make these thorns preserve thee safe , 
And keep thee from a worse foe : 
OH , they shall save thee from the bite , 
Of that devouring Beast below . 
They shall fence out both Sin and Hell , 
Let out Corruption , slay thy Pride : 
So near thee they should never dwell , 
But for advantage on thy side . 
Now blessed Jesus , grant me this , 
That I may such a Lily be , 
And let these Thorns and Briars be 
A Preservation unto me .

As the appletree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons — 

HYMN 30.  

Thou art to me an Appletree , 
My God , for fruit and shade : 
An Appletree thou art to me : 
Thy fruit will never fade . 
Trees of the Wood , are not so good , 
Their Fruits are none , or sour : 
An harbour they for Birds of prey , 
That will the Fruit devour . 
Better than all the Sons thou art , 
Hast been , and ever shall : 
The Angels are the Sons of God , 
But thou excell'st them all . 
The Saints are Sons of great delight , 
Adoption makes them so : 
But Son of God , and Son of Light ! 
there 's no such Son below . 
The firstborn Son , is Mother's dear , 
Her Life wrapped up in his : 
But not a Son can come so near 
My heart , as Jesus is . 
O! let this Apple ▪ tree , my Lord , 
Within my Orchard be : 
Propriety makes all things sweet , 
Or else no sweet to me . 
CANT . II 3.  

— I sat under his shadow with great delight — 

HYMN 31.  

Like as the shadow from the heat , 
Protects and cools the panting Neet : 
So doth my Soul to covert fly ; 
Under thy wings , OH Christ , to lie . 
Shouldst thou let fall thy brightest Rays , 
It would consume my Life and Days : 
I cannot see thy Glory yet ; 
Thy shadow will me better fit . 
How glorious are thy Saints above , 
That see thy Face in purest love ! 
When such delights thy shadow can , 
Contribute to me , sinful man ? 
My Soul ! when he is shadowed forth , 
In Sacramental shades to thee ; 
't is but the Picture of his worth ; 
But what he is , thou dost not see . 
OH , then sit under these sweet shades , 
And often guide thy footsteps thither : 
Till we ascend to brighter glades ; 
In shadows let's sit down together . 
Be quiet , thoughts , thou irksome Flesh ; 
Would thou wert crucified to me ! 
To see no sights ▪ taste no delights , 
Nor know no earthly thing but thee . 
CANT . II 3.  

— And his fruit was sweet unto my taste ▪ 

HYMN 32.  

THE bitter tree , the Cross , 
bore him that bore the fruit ; 
The choicest Fruit that ever was , 
His Father called him to 't . 
There Pardon ▪ grew , and Peace 
With God , with Man , within : 
A Fruit that did transcend by far 
The cursed fruit of Sin. 
Sweet pleasure is but pain ; 
Swear 't profits are deceit : 
The best of all the World , at best , 
Is but a subtle cheat ▪ 
He , he 's the fruitful tree , 
His fruits all pleasant be . 
no Joys or Toys that ere I found , 
Are half so sweet as he . 
Here I may fill my heart : 
OH , let me have a taste : 
My Christ , my Fruit , thou only art , 
As long as Life shall last . 
As thou bearest fruit for me , 
Let me bear Fruit to thee ▪ 
Do thou incline this heart of mine , 
That All-divine it be .

Wonder of Mercy ! now I see , 
And have great cause to think upon , 
What Grace is , when it will be free , 
And puts its Royal clothing on . 
I that deserved to stand at Door , 
And take my Answer on my Knee ; 
Into the House of all his Store , 
Himself vouchsafes to carry me . 
OH , the rich welcome that he gave ; 
My thirsty Soul at first approach ! 
He brought me Sweetmeats out himself ▪ 
And set his choicest Wine abroach : 
Into his house of Wine he brings me , 
Leading me kindly , hand in hand , 
And , smiling , bids me pass the doors , 
Where all his richest treasures stand . 
Himself the House and Banquet is : 
His Presence with me , is a Feast : 
His Smiles are Sweetmeats , all of his , 
Is all in all , to every Guest .

Strive to ascend the blessed Mount : 
no Treats but these , will ever please , 
Or turn to any good account .

HYMN 34.  

What Victories I ever got , 
What Lusts   overcome :

My Banner was his love to me , 
All my success was his : 
His Standard called me forth , and he 
My strength and safety is . 
Do but , OH Christ , OH do but say , 
thou lov'st me ; that 's enough : 
Love is all Weapons of array ; 
Love Armour is of proof : 
Love me , my God , I need no more ; 
My God , I ask no more : 
I perish if thou lov'st me not , 
The Battle is so sore . 
here 's Sin , the World , the Devil and Death ; 
Combined to bring me low : 
I 'm almost beaten out of Breath , 
( Some help ! ) they vex me so : 
OH , do but love me , and I shall 
Banners of love display , 
Will break their hearts , and rout them all , 
And Victor get the day .

Stay me with flagons : comfort me with apples : for I am sick of love . 

HYMN 35.  

OH What redundant love is this ! 
What flowing streams break down the banks ! 
more than enough , OH Lord , it is ; 
Love me but lesle , I 'll give thee thanks . 
here 's love beyond all bounds and measure , 
So free , so full , so large , so quick : 
't is strange to see so vast a treasure . 
Love made me well , and makes me sick . 
But sick for more , and sick to see , 
The Fountain whence these streams do flow ; 
Yet sick for more ▪ and sick to be 
In place where this vast love doth grow . 
Stay me with Flagons of that Wine , 
Was pressed out of thyself , the Vine : 
Thy Blood , OH Christ , will stay the Fire , 
That burns in me , sick with desire . 
OH , let the Apples of my love , 
Cool Fires in my Love ▪ sick heart : 
Till I below , and thou above , 
Shall meet at last , and never part . 
Till I am sick , I am not well : 
OH that I had this sickness Lord , 
Such Joy doth in love sickness dwell , 
Such as my health could never afford .

MY aching head and heart , 
thou hast a hand to stay ; 
Another hand that shall impart , 
Embraces all the day . 
In both thy hands , OH Christ , 
My safety is secured : 
Within the foldings of thy arms , 
My Soul is safe immured . 
Castles and Towers are 
no safeguard in my case ; 
Nor all the Ocean's Oaken walls , 
With me have any place : 
Only his circling Arms , 
As with a Wall of Fire ; 
Defends me from the dreadful harms , 
Which Sin and Hell conspire : 
Besides the help that 's in 't ; 
The Love that streams this way , 
Conveys more Spirits to my heart , 
Than fear can take away . 
It is , OH let it be , 
The great support I find ; 
That when I faint for want of thee , 
thou have me in thy mind . 
CANT . II 7.  

I charge you , OH ye daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes and hinds of the field , that ye sti● not up , nor awake my Love , until 〈◊〉 please . 

HYMN 37.  

OH Let him take his rest , that hath 
Travelled so long , so far , 
To rescue Souls from burning wrath ; 
OH , make it all your care , 
You Daughters of Jerusalem ; 
You that pretend to love him . 
OH , give him no disturbance then , 
Nor to disquiet move him . 
I charge you by the Hinds and Roes ; 
Those loving Creatures shall 
Witness against you as your foes , 
And on you Vengeance call . 
If you more brutish than the Beast , 
That want molest his Master , 
Shall by your Sin disturb his rest , 
And bring him to disaster . 
OH Christ , my Love ! Give thou the charge , 
The house and all is thine : 
OH , take the Keys and the walk at large , 
Command whatever is mine . 
I cannot bind them to the Peace , 
A weak and private man : 
Authority can make them cease , 
Let Sin do what it can . 
CANT . II 8.  

The voice of my beloved ! behold he comes leaping upon the mountains , and skipping upon the hills . 

HYMN 38.  

't is my beloved's Voice , I 'm sure , 
't is not a stranger 's fallacy : 
That breatheth in the Word so pure , 
In which I learn that he is nigh : 
Behold , I see him coming , though 
The Hills and Mountains of the Earth : 
The great Zanzumming Tyrants do 
Oppose his Actions in their birth . 
Behold he comes , you Princes all , 
That have opposed his Royal Will ; 
You must expect a dreadful fall , 
That Vengeance should your Besoms fill . 
Leaping and Skipping on the Hills , 
Trampling upon your greatest Powers , 
Dancing with pleasurable skills ; 
he 'll pull down all your lofty Tow'rs : 
Behold he comes , you shall not hinder , 
no difficulty stands before him , 
But he 'll be sure to tread it under , 
And shortly make your Crowns adore him . 
Make haste , my God , make no delay ; 
Thy waiting Spouse hath long sat up ; 
OH , make thee Wings , and come away ; 
Give Antichrist her bitter Cup.  
CANT . II 9  

My beloved is like a Roe , or young Hart — 

HYMN 39  

OH My beloved Lord ! 
To me thy grace afford : 
The flames of thy sweet love to me , 
Kindle my love to thee . 
Give me but leave to love thee , 
That art so much above me : 
Let me be bold to let thee know , 
To thee myself I owe. 
My God , my heart is thine ; 
't is thine , it is not mine : 
Let me but love , and call thee so ; 
it 's all the bliss I know . 
thou art a pleasant Roe , 
Hunted to Death below ; 
Whose Flesh and Blood for Sinners need , 
Is Meat and Drink indeed . 
thou art a loving Hart , 
Killed with a murdering dart : 
A murdering dart that drew a flood , 
Of dear and precious blood : 
OH , let that Blood me purge , 
From Sins , Filth , Gild , and Scourge , 
And let that broken Flesh me Feast , 
Till I with thee shall rest . 
CANT . II 9  

— He standeth behind our wall , he looks forth out at the windows , he shows himself through the lattices . 

HYMN 40.  

HE shows himself in cloudy gleams , 
Obscure and Window-visions : 
Glimpses of Love , and twilight beams , 
And dark Illuminations . 
Why doth my Love immure his Face , 
And shroud himself behind our Wall ? 
The Lattices Eclipse his Grace , 
And Windows interrupt his call : 
Is it because the visive Powers 
Of Mortals can't endure his sight ; 
Or to distinguish these dark hours , 
From those that shine in perfect light ? 
What ere it be , 't is just that he 
Should now and then withdraw his Face : 
And 't is rich Grace to let me see , 
The least glance in the darkest place . 
Behind our Wall , is not so far , 
That I should think him wholly gone : 
These Lattices and Windows are 
Helps to discern he 'll come anon . 
A clearer sight , OH , that I could 
Obtain ! a sight that doth excel : 
There is no fear that ever I should 
Admire too much , or Love too well . 
CANT . II 10.  

My beloved spoke , and said unto me , Rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away . 

HYMN 41.  

Whose is this rousing Voice , I hear , 
That breathes so sweet an Air , 
Through Walls and Lattices ? so dear , 
So ravishing , so rare ! 
't is my Beloved's voice , I know , 
That Court's my drowsy mind : 
That bids me rise from things below , 
And leave myself behind . 
Arise , my Love , and come away , 
Rouse from thy Morning sleep : 
Rise up , my fair One , no delay ; 
Thomas locked in Slumbers deep . 
My God , I come , I find no rest , 
no Bed of Ease , but thee : 
The present World is at the best , 
A Bed of Thorns to me . 
My God , I come ; but o , how loath ▪ 
I've drunk a sleeping Cup : 
And OH , the dulness ! OH the sloth ! 
Dear Jesus help me up : 
then will I come away , and leave 
My Sins and Fears behind me : 
Farewell vain Pleasures , let me go , 
And let my Jesus find me .

HYMN 42.  

Rejoice ye people of the Lords , 
There is a glorious day ; 
There is a day will break your Cords , 
And fright your Fears away : 
The Winter blast is almost past ; 
Farewell the Rain and Flood : 
Now Antichrist no more shall taste 
The sweet of Martyr's blood . 
There comes a Church-reviving Spring ; 
The Flowers adorn the Earth : 
The Turtles with the Birds do sing ; 
All hearts are full of Mirth . 
A time when every Tree shall yield , 
A pleasant Fruit to God : 
And all the Creatures of the Field , 
Shall feel no more his Rod. 
Rise then , my Love , and come away , 
Stand ready for the time : 
Prepare thee , for this longed for day , 
And let it find thee mine . 
Awake ! behold , I 'm at the door , 
Let me not find thee sleeping : 
My Spirit is up , I 'll quickly put 
An end to all thy weeping . 
CANT . II 14.  

OH my Dove ! that art in the clefts of the rocks , in the secret places of the stairs : let me hear thy voice , for sweet is thy voice , and thy countenance is comely . 

HYMN 43.  

MY mournful , chaste and harmless Dove , 
My Spouse thou art , and thee I love : 
I've hide thee in the craggy Rock , 
As if secured by Key and Lock . 
The clefts and rending of my Side , 
Oped a passage to my Heart , 
And there my Dove shall safe abide , 
And thou and I will never part : 
The Hawks , and other Fowl's of prey ; 
The Winter Storms of Persecution , 
Shall but entice my Dove away , 
And cleave my Heart for her Admission ▪ 
The secret places of the Stairs , 
Where she retreats to breathe her Prayers , 
Are open to my view ; my Dove , 
I 'll meet thee there , and show my Love ▪ 
OH , let me hear thy Voice , my Dear , 
Thomas broke and inarticulate : 
Thy Nonsense I 'll be glad to hear , 
And prise the Prayer which thou dost hate ▪ 
OH , let me see thee now and then , 
That sees thee always from my place . 
Present thyself once and again ; 
it 's joy to me to see thy Face . 
CANT . II 15.  

●ake us the Foxes , the little Foxes that spoil the vines , for our vines have tender grapes . 

HYMN 44.  

Take us the subtle Foxes , Lord , 
They are too wise for us to take : 
They spoil thy holy places , and 
Entrenching there their Burrows make . 
They bark and peil the fruitful Vines : 
OH tender thou the tender Grapes : 
Surround them by thy wakeful power , 
Till it be said , not one escapes . 
Let them be taken in their craft , 
thou in the Trenches dig their Graves : 
Pluck off their Fox's skin , and drown 
Their Carcases in wrathful Waves . 
Let all the World see what they are , 
Let them not cheat thy Churches more : 
Entrap them in the traps they lay , 
And lay their Sin at their own door . 
Blessed Redeemer keep my Soul ; 
A weak and tender Grape am I , 
A tender Grape that can't escape 
A little Fox's subtlety . 
Preserve thy Church , and her descend , 
From Lion's teeth , and Foxes wiles : 
So will we sing to our great King , 
When thou shalt bless our Cheeks with ( smiles .

My Jesus , I am thine ! 
My Christ is mine by deed of gift , 
And that 's a title good : 
And I am his by purchase right , 
He bought me with his Blood. 
I 'll have no other Love but he , 
I like my choice so well : 
he 'll have no other Spouse but me ; 
Together let us dwell : 
He feeds among the Lilies white ; 
There he doth most frequent : 
amongst his Saints , all his delight 
Is placed to his content ▪ 
Their Graces are his sweet repast , 
Their Prayers and Praises are 
A Banquet to him , and their Faith 
His most delicious Fare : 
OH let but me , and this Church be 
A Field of Lilies , where 
My Christ may feast , what likes him best , 
Upon his sent-in cheer . 
CANT . II 17.  

Until the day break , and the shadows flee away : turn my beloved , and be like the Roe ▪ or the young . Hart upon the mountains of Bether . 

HYMN 46.  

Why stays the lingering Day ? 
What ails the Morning light , 
To lie a Bed so long , while I 
am longing for its sight ? 
There is a Nuptial day 
Shall perfect all ere long : 
When all the shades shall flee away , 
And all the Saints shall throng 
Into the Bridal room , 
And coalesce in one : 
One Heart , one Spouse , to Christ alone , 
Made so by Union . 
A bright and glorious day , 
no clouds shall hide the Sun : 
And universal Joy shall raise 
The heart of every one . 
The glorious Angels shall 
These Nuptials celebrate , 
And gladly sound their Trumpets round , 
At a Triumphant rate . 
Till then , protect me Lord , 
And turn thy steps to me : 
OH hasten , hasten , all thou canst ; 
Delays Distractions b● ▪ 
OH , be thou like the Roe , 
With winged speed make haste , 
Or as a Hart that runs apart , 
On Bethers Mountains fast .

By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not . 

HYMN 47.  

MY God I love thee with my Soul , 
And yet I lie in Bed ; 
Thomas thou art mine , and I am thime , 
My heart is almost dead . 
Such drowsy damps o'recast my Joys ; 
I seek thee half asleep : 
And now I cannot hear thy Voice , 
I only sigh and weep . 
I seek thee , but I find thee not : 
My Lord , where art thou gone ? 
Into what Covert art thou got , 
And leav'st me here alone ? 
A slothful Suitor I have been ; 
It prompts me to conclude : 
My Christ won't humour drowsiness ▪ 
Nor mind dull Solitude . 
Wake me , my God , with Voice and Rodriguez : 
OH rouse my drowsy Senses : 
Let me not lie , and sleeping dye , 
Or idly make pretences . 
My Soul awake , and rise , and shake 
This dulness off : for why ? 
If thou will vainly live to sleep , 
then must thou sleeping dye .

I will arise now , and go about the city , in the streets , and in the broad ways : I will seek him whom my soul love's : I sought him , but I found him not . 

HYMN 48.  

IN vain do I divert myself , 
And think the World shall ease me : 
And roll myself in earthly Pelf , 
And in its Pleasures please me . 
In the broad ways and City ▪ streets ; 
A Christ is rarely found : 
A Soul distressed , he seldom greets 
Upon such dirty ground . 
thou thou hast left this wicked World long since : 
OH , Christ thou art not there : 
OH , let me get me out from hence , 
And seek some other where . 
Be gone , vain Pleasures , empty Toys , 
You please , yet vex me sore : 
You interrupt my sp'ritual Joys : 
I 'll never love you more . 
I seek in vain , my Christ to gain , 
He dwells in other places : 
you 're all my hindrance , and my sin , 
I 'll never see your Faces . 
I thought I might enjoy his Light , 
In midst of worldly Pleasure : 
But I have found the World abound 
With no such blessed Treasure .

The watchmen that go about the City , found me : to whom I said , saw ye not him whom my soul loveth ? 

HYMN 49.  

You spiritual Watchmen at the Gate : 
OH you whose Office 't is 
To pity my distressed State , 
And tell me where he is : 
He whom my Soul love's ; you know who , 
I shall not need to name : 
The Earth , the Seas , the Heavens' and you , 
Are filled with his Fame . 
Tell me , OH tell me , where he is , 
If it be known to you : 
He is my only Joy , and Bliss , 
My Life and Heaven too ? 
If I can't find him , I must die , 
What is this Life to me ? 
If he absent , my Soul is spent : 
OH , tell me where is he ▪ 
He that my Sin hath grieved away , 
Whose absence now I moan , 
That shed his Blood for my Souls good : 
OH , whither is he gone ? 
What! can't you answer ? are you such 
Watchmen that cannot see ? 
Or want you power in this dark hour , 
To bring my Lord to me ?

It was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my soul loveth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother's house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me . 

HYMN 50.  

MY Soul , if thou a Christ wouldst find , 
In a distressed gloomy day ; 
Unto the Shepherds bend thy mind , 
And they 'll instruct thee in the way . 
no sooner parted from them , when 
I found my Joy , my Soul's delight : 
My heart did dance within me then , 
And I was ravished with his sight . 
I found my Jesus ; let me come , 
And him embrace with both these arms : 
That like the rising of the Sun , 
Did rid my Soul of Midnight harms . 
My Soul ! now hold him fast , and don't 
Disturb his quiet any more , 
Thy life and happ'ness lies upon 't : 
A fresh departure will be sore : 
I 'll bring him to my Mother's House , 
there 's Souls to save , as well as mine : 
I 'll Feast him there , with all that 's rare , 
And give him most delicious Wine . 
The Wine that makes his heart full glad , 
Is when he tastes the Loves of those 
That once were Rebels , or as bad , 
That are his Friends , and were his Foes . 
CANT . III 5.  

I charge you , OH ye Daughters of Jerusalem , by the Roes , and by the hinds , that ye stir not up , nor awake my beloved , till he please . 

HYMN 51.  

What pity 't is that such a Guest , 
Whose Essence is all Love : 
Should be disturbed in his rest , 
And forced to make remove . 
You Members of his Churches all , 
Would I could charm you so ; 
By Roes and Hinds , to still the Winds , 
And make no noise below . 
He gave me rest the other day , 
When I was almost dead 
With frights and fears , and drowned in tears , 
He lifted up my head . 
I never met with Joy till then , 
Nor never knew a day , 
Nor saw a Sun till he was come , 
To fright my Fears away . 
Contentments ! there are no such things , 
There is no Sunshine-weather : 
no happiness , but that which brings 
Christ and my Soul together . 
't is just that you and I requite 
This blessed Peace he gave us , 
And freely give him rest for rest , 
As our dear Lord would have us . 
CANT . III 6.  

Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all powders of the merchant ? 

HYMN 52.  

I Herd him speak his Love to Saints , 
That were out of desertion creeping : 
Arabian deserts spicy fumes , 
Never smelled so sweet , as smoak of weeping . 
who 's this ! what glorious person 's this , 
That takes this solitary path ; 
That fears no way , nor Beasts of prey ; 
Of Desert-frights , no terror hath ? 
But through all these dangers dares 
To come to a despised Jesus , 
And warily escapes the Desert-snares , 
And cries , there 's nothing else will please us ▪ 
It is my Church ; to me she seems , 
Like to some smoky Pillar ▪ which 
Fired by the Holy Spirit means 
To soar alost an heavenly pitch . 
she 's in my Nostrils sweet perfume ; 
The Merchant-powders worthless be : 
The Myrrh , the Frankincense may soon 
Their Odours lose , but never she : 
Her Gifts and Graces , Prayers and Tears , 
Her Faith and Patience , Joy and Fears , 
Her Up's and Down's , her Sigh and Groans , 
Like bruised Myrrh , perfume the Air. 
Come forward then with winged pace , 
And leave this Wilderness behind : 
The nearer me , the sweeter place ; 
Be thou but loyal , I 'll be kind . 
CANT . III 7.  

Behold his bed , which is Solomons : threescore valiant men are about it , of the Valiants of Israel : 

HYMN 53.  

King Solomon's Bed , that guarded was 
With threescore Men of Might , 
Whose Weapons breathed Fire to those , 
That waked him in the Night ; 
Types out the Royal Guards , that tend 
His Throne and Diadem : 
Numberless Angels guarding him , 
That Guards himself and them : 
My Jesus ! he is now at rest , 
At God's right hand of Power , 
And of eternal Joy possessed , 
Secured as in a Tower . 
no might nor spite shall ere affright ; 
The bloody sweat is past : 
no more the Tears shall trickle down , 
That trickled down so fast . 
The flaming Cherubims of old , 
That kept the Tree of Life : 
Still keep the Chambers of the Lamb , 
And his beloved Wife . 
OH thou that lov'st my Soul , command , 
send me but one of those : 
But one of these sweet Angels , and 
I 'll never fear my foes . 
CANT . III 8.  

They all hold swords , being expert in war , every man hath his sword upon his thigh , because of the fear of the night . 

HYMN 54.  

ANGELS expert in War , 
Heavens' great Artillery : 
Gods Hosts unseen , Defenders are 
Of my dear Love and Me. 
't is not ' cause I deserve 
To have a Life guard by me ; 
But ' cause he in a Bed of love 
Will please to settle nigh me . 
If Hosts against me rise , 
And men of War shall scare me : 
The Lord of Hosts will send his Hosts , 
They in their arms shall bear me . 
The Lord will Muster up , 
And send them to the Courts 
Of Tyrant ▪ Rulers , who shall down 
With them , and all their Forts . 
Believe it , there are Thrones , 
And Nobles sit upon them : 
Above the earthly greatest ones , 
And Judgements issue from them . 
These , these shall do us right , 
When we can nothing do ; 
With Herod's of the World shall fight , 
And overcome them too . 
CANT . III 9  

King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon . 

Ver. 10 He made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem . 



HYMN 55.  

King Solomon's Chariot for his Bride , 
Of Wood of Lebanon was made : 
This Chariot bottom was of Gold , 
This Chariot Silver pillars had . 
Covered with Purple , paved with Love : 
But OH , how far surpassed by him , 
Who is All love from head to foot , 
To draw all Love to him again . 
Jesus , King Jesus , for his Spouse , 
For the Lamb's Wife , his Bride , hath built 
A far more glorious Chariot , which 
With Love and Power is double gilt : 
Braced with the everlasting Arms , 
Whose covering is eternial Glory , 
Whose substance is a Love that warms , 
Whose Wheels run to the Joy before ye . 
Now blessed be that boundless Love , 
And blessed be that endlefs Power , 
And blessed be that God above , 
That made his Chariot like a Tower. 
This Honour all his people have , 
They go on foot , and yet they ride : 
Thus rides the Princes , when advanced 
In stately Pomp , by Prince his side . 
CANT . III 11.  

Go forth , OH ye daughters of Zion , and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals , and in the day of the gladness of his heart .

OH That , that blessed day were come , 
When we might meet our Solomon , 
Crowned King of Saints , and Nations , and 
Having the World at his command ! 
His Father hath already Crowned him , 
Given him a Title to this thing : 
When shall his Mother's arms surround him , 
And Crown him her eternal King ? 
'T will be the gladness of his heart , 
When he shall once espouse that Spouse : 
When Kingdoms shall their Loves impart , 
And all his Foes caught in a Noose : 
Arise ! descend thou Royal Prince , 
Thy Coronation-day is come : 
In Seat of thy Magnficence , 
Thy Church would fain affix thy Crown . 
Thy Mother , Sister , Brother , wait , 
And long to see that blessed day , 
When Sin and sorrow 's out of date , 
And crowned Jesus bears the sway . 
OH , when shall Jews and Gentles both , 
Fasten thy Crown upon thy head ! 
Gentiles have done it , Jews hold off ; 
By both must this be managed .

HYMN 57  

I That have made and formed , 
By curious Art and Skill : 
The Beauties of the upper World , 
According to my Will ▪ 
I that behold and see 
Those beauties all the day : 
( Should Mortal eyes but steal a glance , 
'T would take their Lives away : ) 
Yet I say , thou art fair , 
Thy Grace's beauties are : 
My Father's face and mine doth shine 
Upon that Face of thine . 
The trifling Beauties which 
Fond Lovers idolise , 
Are not so fair , nor half so rich 
As thou art in my Eyes : 
OH how I love that Soul , 
that 's true to God and me ! 
My heart 's inclined , my Love is blind , 
Their faults I cannot see . 
I 'll shortly bow the Heavens' : 
OH how I long to come ! 
I will arise , and rend the Skies , 
And fetch my fair One home .

— thou hast doves eyes within thy locks — 

HYMN 58.  

Now I 'll consider in its place , 
And view my Blood-redeemed prize ▪ 
The sparkling Diamonds of thy Face , 
The Dovelike Beauty of thine Eyes . 
thou hadst an Eye of Flesh was wont 
To send forth Beams of lustful Fire , 
That after Vanity did hunt , 
And fill thy heart with base desires . 
A wand'ring tempting rolling Eye , 
A Casement opeed to let in Sin : 
But now 't is chaste , with eyesalve washed , 
And takes diviner Objects in : 
But OH , that intellectual Eye , 
Whereby thou seest things unseen ; 
Whose objects quite are out of sight , 
That eyes me through the darkest Screen ! 
That shines like Diamonds in the dark , 
Or Stars that brighten blackest Night : 
Knowledge and Faith such Power hath , 
To see by Dark as well as Light. 
My Soul admire , and raise thee higher , 
With both these Eyes behold that spark , 
Whose Beams have given thee light and sight , 
That once were blind and in the dark . 
CANT . iv. 2.  

— Thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount Gilead . 

HYMN 59  

The hair , the Beauty of the Face , 
That taking Ornament ; 
That blusheth nothing at disgrace ; 
it 's cut , it 's shaved , it 's rend ; 
It open lies to all assaults , 
And yet it feels it not : 
The Razors shave , the Sizars cut 
All wrongs are soon forgot . 
My Church , I love thy Patience , 
This I admire in thee , 
Under all injuries content ; 
Those that affronted thee , win thee . 
Like Goats on Gileads Mountains shorn , 
Stripped of their hairy Fleece : 
Yet not a groan , all wrongs are born , 
Their shearing breaks no Peace . 
This warms thy heart , as hair thy head : 
How ornamental ' 't is ! 
When Patience can impow'r a man 
To conquer all he sees : 
With this sweet frame , in love I am : 
it 's rare in my account : 
To be forgot , and feel it not , 
Is Patience paramount .

Made red , not with thy Blood , but mine ; 
it 's from my passion fed ; 
no natural Colour in this World , 
Can yield so deep a red : 
OH , how I love these ruby Lips , 
I love to hear them speak ; 
Thy Prayers and Praises , Nectar sips , 
To me , though faint and weak . 
Thy Doctrines , Counsels , Cordials are , 
To me and those that hear them : 
Thy sharp reproofs are kill darts , 
Yet health to those that bear them . 
My Soul admire , and much desire , 
Thy soul 's admiring Lover : 
Be it thy Grace , thy words to place , 
And tell thy Speeches over , 
As men tell Gold , OH , weigh thy Words , 
Thy Speech exactly measure : 
So shall thy King delight to sing , 
And praise this vocal Treasure .

— Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks . 

HYMN 61.  

I Love thee , for thy Cheeks , my Spouse , 
A Virgin blush adorns them : 
The modesty that crowns thy Brows , 
A holy shame informs them : 
Have you not been where you have seen 
The blushing Pomegranate , 
All overspread with rosy red , 
As Nature did create ? 
Thy Temples shaded in thy Locks , 
With rosy blushes spread , 
Doth much express thy bashfulness : 
True Virtue vails her head . 
Thy guilt and shame , for what 's to blame , 
thou canst not face it out : 
Thy flushing , blush , fears and tears , 
Are beauties out of doubt . 
My Soul ! this consternation due , 
Becomes the Virgin-bride 
Of that same bleeding Lover , who 
For thy Salvation died ▪ 
OH let me never , never trace , 
The steps of Sinners bold : 
Nor hide my Sin , but hide my Face , 
As with a blush controlled .

ye elder Sons of living day , 
Peers of the Upper-house ; 
And all you Commoners below , 
Come and behold my Spouse . 
Thy stately Neck , like David's Tower , 
Built for an Armoury : 
Unites thy Body to thy Head , 
Never to part ; and why , 
A thousand Shields the promise yields , 
As many Swords thy Faith , 
Thomas Hell and Devils do their worst , 
Thy Soul Protection hath . 
thou shalt not truckle , no nor buckle 
To inimical spite : 
Strong in the Lord thou art , and in 
The Power of his Might . 
Thy Fire-breathing Cannons fly 
In face of all thy Foes : 
For thee a David's Tower am I , 
' 'Gainst all that thee oppose : 
If sin or men infest thee , than 
Thy Neck a Tower is ; 
Thy Soul , though tossed , shall never be lost 
In such a Tower as this . 
CANT . iv. 5.  

Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins , which feed among the lilies . 

HYMN 63.  

Thy Breasts , the seat of Love , 
And Nature's Ornament , 
With full-pent milky treasures give 
Thy offspring nourishment . 
Such milky streams do flow , 
To nourish all thy Seed , 
As fruitful Roes that fat their twins , 
And midst the Lilies feed . 
Thy Sons and Daughters are 
Begat from Heaven above : 
A num'rous Offa ▪ spring will appear 
In that great day of Love : 
thou hast two Testaments , 
Replete with Milk Divine , 
With these thou sucklest all my Saints , 
And mak'st their Faces shine . 
I must admire the man 
That spring's from such a Father , 
That strongly draws by Grace's laws , 
The breasts of such a Mother . 
then drink and thirst again , 
As Babes the Breasts adore : 
Till thou shalt come to thy blessed home , 
And drink and thirst no more . 
CANT . iv. 6.  

Until the day breaks , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountains of myrrh , and to the hill of frankincense . 

HYMN 64.  

There is a blessed day will break 
A glorious Light will shortly come , 
Whose rays will make the shades betake , 
As frighted , to their lasting home . 
A day will drink up all the Rain , 
And scatter all the Fogs away : 
And fully rout the dreadful train 
Of Clouds , that now Eclipse the day . 
no more shall Sin or Fears bespatter 
The glorious beauty of thy Face : 
no more shall bloody Tyrants scatter 
Their roaring Bulls in every place . 
There is a day and door of hope ; 
( I mean , to hasten all I can ) 
That will surprise both Turk and Pope , 
And the bloodthirsty wicked man 
Till then , the mount of Myrrh above , 
And Heaven's hill of Frankincense , 
Must for a while obscure my Love , 
And Person , from the eye of sense . 
But do not fear ! from that Ascent , 
As from a Mountain , I can see 
( And did before ) how all things went : 
Till then , do thou confided in me .

In precious blood and tears : 
Thy parts are all inspired , 
All Graces in thee shine : 
Each faculty my Love hath fired , 
And charmed that heart of thine . 
Degrees are wanting still ; 
't is yet thy Infant-state : 
But yet we can spell out a man , 
In Limbs that are not great . 
I 'll polish thee , my Dove ! 
I 'll off with every spot ; 
I 'll drive the trade till it be said , 
What Graces hast thou not ! 
Thy Sin and Guiltiness , 
My Royal Robe shall cover , 
And my imputed Righteousness , 
Shall make thy God thy Lover : 
My Soul ! 't is done for ever : 
For ever praise his name ; 
His Blood was shed , thy Sins are dead , 
Never to rise again . 
CANT . iv. 8.  

Come with me from Lebanon ( my Spouse ) with me from Lebanon : look from the top of Amana , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , from the lions dens , from the mountains of the leopards . 

HYMN 66.  

And now my well-beloved Spouse , 
Since I have set thee free , 
And cleared thy stains , that none remains , 
Now love thyself and me . 
Come , Royal Princess , come with me , 
thou shalt not come alone : 
My presence shall thy Conduct be , 
Only consent and come ▪ 
From Lebanon , that Mount of Pleasures , 
And from Amana too : 
These barren Mountains yield no treasure , 
Arise and let us go 
From Lion's jaws , and Leopards paws , 
And all the wicked rout : 
From Traitor's gins , and Spoilers dens ; 
Come , I will lead thee out . 
there 's nothing can degrade a man , 
Like bruit-society , 
Or make him from his Essence come , 
Like wicked company : 
Resolved then , I 'll leave these men , 
Whom I did once adore ▪ 
At Jesus call , I 'll leave them all , 
And never come at them more . 
CANT . iv. 9  

thou hast ravished my heart , my Sister , my Spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of thy neck . 

HYMN 67.  

MY Sister , by the Father's side ; 
And Spouse , by all consent : 
Sister adopt , and Spouse elect , 
I 'm full , and I must vent . 
My ravished heart hath felt a dart , 
And I am all desire : 
I , who created Fire and Love , 
With Love am set on Fire . 
Something hath smote me from thine eye : 
That eye of Faith , it is , 
That single wounding eye of Faith , 
That makes me love thee thus . 
That dares upon a naked word 
Of Promise trust me so : 
That will secure itself of Love , 
Even whether I will or no. 
The chain is Love , that draws my Love ; 
Do thou but say , thou lov'st me : 
It is a chain , I captive am , 
And nothing ever removes me . 
My Soul ! fix this same Eye of Faith 
Upon him steadfastly : 
Fasten the link with soldering Love , 
he 's thine eternally . 
CANT . iv. 10.  

How fair is my Love , my Sister , my Spouse ! how much better is thy love than wine ! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices ! 

HYMN 68  

Thou 'rt fair , my Love , thy Love is fair : 
How fair I can't express : 
Better than Wine ; but how much better , 
I leave to thee to guests ! 
Love is heart-chearing wine ; bestow 
A glass of Love upon me , 
And I 'll forget my Sorrows great , 
The wrongs that have been done me . 
I have no thirst but for thy Love ; 
Love me , and stay my thirst : 
OH do but try to love me ; why ? 
Because I loved thee first . 
Let no perfume henceforth presume , 
To gratify my wants ; 
no Spices sweet , my Nostrils greet ; 
There are no sweet but Saints . 
I love them with a pard'ning love , 
Their follies I forgive . 
I Love them with a lasting love , 
That shall for ever live . 
Amazement stops my verse and me ! 
OH Lord , that lov'st me thus ; 
OH let me never , never be 
Unkind , ungracious ! 
CANT . iv. 11.  

Thy lips , OH my spouse , drop as the honey ▪ comb : honey and milk are under thy tongue — 

HYMN 69.  

The gracious words thy lips adorn , 
Like drops of Honey from the Comb : 
't is Canaan's Language newly born , 
From a Divine inspired Tongue . 
Honey and Milk are not so sweet , 
As savoury Speeches dropping down , 
That nourish whomsoever they meet , 
And from a spir'tual Fountain come . 
When Lips drop sighs , and Eyes drops tears 
In penitential sight of Sin : 
When Speech drops Praises , and strong Prayers , 
It shows a Honey ▪ comb within . 
When nour'shing , and soul ▪ fatting words , 
Lie breeding underneath the Tongue : 
And when due season birth affords , 
This , this my Love inspires my Song . 
My Soul , learn this ! Are gracious words 
So sweet to Christ thy dearest friend : 
then don't impose upon his nose , 
The Carr'on stink that base words send . 
Season my Lips with Salt , my God , 
And sift my Language from its dross : 
For why should I so foolishly , 
With Speeches vain contract my loss ? 
CANT . iv. 11.  

— And the smell of thy garment is like the smell of Lebanon . 

HYMN 70.  

Naked , and in thy blood ▪ before , 
Unpollisht , rude and rough : 
I spread my Skirt , and threw quite o'er , 
A Garment large enough : 
And now like blessed Jacob , in 
The Priestly Robe , his Mother 
Vested him with , he passeth fair , 
And go'th for elder Brother . 
Even thus imputed purple smells , 
When on the Sinner thrown ; 
Like to a Field which God hath blessed : 
Thomas borrowed , 't is thy own . 
The fragrant smells of Lebanon , 
The Mount of Canaan's glory : 
There never was such sweetness as 
These Garments shed before ye . 
When once thou get'st my Garment on , 
Art with my Merits clothed : 
My Father takes thee for his Son , 
And for his best beloved . 
My God perfume my Soul , and rest it , 
And in thy Bosom lay it : 
Upon thy tender Bowels rest it ; 
't is done , if thou but say it . 
CANT . iv. 12.  

A garden enclosed is my Sister , my Spouse : a Spring shut up , a fountain sealed . 

HYMN 71.  

MY Spouse ! I have enclosed , 
And strongly fenced thee in , 
With rocky Walls , and scorching Fire ; 
thou hast my Garden been . 
If men dare scale the Flames , 
To their own loss they venture : 
I 'll keep thee so on every side ; 
they 'll knock , but shall not enter . 
I 'll plant thee with sweet Flowers , 
And every fruitful Tree ▪ 
And all about I 'll make me Bowers , 
And take my walks in thee . 
I 'll shut and seal thee up , 
no dirty foot shall see 
Thy heavenly Springs and Water , 
thou shalt my Fountain be . 
OH thou , the Spring of Springs , 
Whose Fountains always run : 
Fountain of Fountains , and all things , 
From thee my Waters come . 
OH thou , the King of kings , 
Plant thou thy Garden round : 
Let every walk thy Praises talk , 
In thee my fruit is found . 
CANT . iv. 13.  

Thy plants are an Orchard of Pomegranates with pleasant fruits , Camphire with Spikenard . Ver. 14 Spikenard and Saffron , Calamus and Cinnamon , with all trees of frankincense , Myrrh and Aloes , with all the chief spices . 

HYMN 72.  

Come , now , my Sister , let us go , 
And how see the young of Sets do ▪ 
The Standarts must not stand , I have 
A better use to put them to . 
These I 'll transplant to Paradise , 
With Glory I will fill their faces : 
They must be gone , their work is done , 
The young ones must supply their places . 
The Lambs , the Babes , my Churches breed , 
Are a more rav'shing sight to me : 
Than the Pomegranate full of seed , 
Or all the Arabian spices be . 
The Spikenard , Camphire , and the rest 
Of choicest Aromatic fumes , 
Are worthless , when they do their best , 
Let them be buried in their Tombs . 
But OH , the Joy I take to see 
My pregnant Church her Children bear : 
The young ones that convert to me ! 
My choicest Heaven on Earth is there . 
Young ones awake , since I do take 
Such pleasure in your budding Graces : 
Repent , Convert , or 't will be Death 
For you to let me see your faces . 
CANT . iv. 15.  

A fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , and streams from Lebanon . 

HYMN 73.  

IF I a Garden am , thou art , 
OH Christ , the living Spring ; 
If I have any sprouting Plants , 
The Water thou dost bring . 
no Water , than no Fruit , no growth , 
no Spire can pierce the Clods : 
The Fruit I bear , if it be rare , 
It is not mine , but Gods. 
My heart was dead the other day , 
And then sweet Mercy came , 
And washed it in a Spring of Blood ; 
It came to Life again . 
My heart was hard , as I may say , 
As hard as any Stones : 
I drench it in the living Spring , 
And it to softness comes . 
My heart was cold , as cold as Ice ; 
Some heat it did require : 
I found the living Waters had 
In them a living Fire . 
Now let thy dying , living blood , 
Stream as from Lebanon : 
Water my wants , and wash my Plants , 
Or we are all undone . 
CANT . iv. 16.  

Awake , OH Northwind , and come thou South , blow upon my garden , that the spices thereof may flow out — 

HYMN 74.  

I Must have Air and Wind , 
As well as Water , Lord : 
Or else my Garden , that is I , 
no fruit can ere afford : 
Arise Northwind and South , 
Rough and serene , both best , 
And do thou time their gates and thine : 
In both Is all be blessed . 
there 's not one Plant will thrive , 
Or Flower hold its scent , 
Unless thy Spirit , Lord , contrive 
To breathe their Nutriment . 
How will the Spices flow ? 
How will my Grace's flourish , 
If thy sweet Spirit please to blow , 
And drooping Flowers cherish ! 
For loves-sake let me beg ; 
OH Holy Ghost , thy Grace , 
Thy Breathe , Gifting , Fillings , Seals ; 
Let each work take its place . 
If my Beloved come , 
As he a coming is : 
Not finding me and Fruit at home , 
he 'll say my heart 's not his . 
CANT . iv. 16.  

— Let my mies beloved come into his Garden , and eat his pleasant fruit . 

HYMN 75.  

MY Garden is thy Garden , Lord , 
Therefore do thou the Winds awake : 
Let sharp and cold North-winds accord , 
With gentle South , and their turns take . 
Sometimes I need a nipping Frost : 
( Lord , not too sharp , lest all be lost : ) 
To cross my sin , let me be crossed ; 
But Winds serene advantage most . 
Let North awake and stop ; but let 
The South awake , and come and blow : 
Too much the North will nip the fruits ; 
But OH , the South will make them grow . 
OH Spirit of Love , and harmless Dove , 
Do thou take wings and fly to me : 
Or else give wings to climbing Love , 
And quickly I will up to thee . 
My Lord , here 's little fruit for thee , 
Thomas my Soul's Garden do its best : 
But if thou comest , there 's Fruit for me ▪ 
Thomas I have none , I shall be blessed . 
Thus poor Folks entertain the King , 
And Landlords sit at Tenant's table ; 
They have no more , but what they bring , 
thou should have more , if I were able .

Laus Jehovae . 

CANT . v. 1.  

I am come into my garden , my Sister , my Spouse : I have gathered my myrrh with my spice : I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey : I have drunk my wine with my milk — 

HYMN 76.  

Well ! I am come , my Spouse , 
Thy Prayers have given me wings : 
I have accepted all thy vows , 
And tasted all thy things . 
In thee I find my myrrh , 
My honey-combs I eat : 
Thy Milk and Wine is all Divine , 
Thy Spices all are sweet . 
Thy Plants that I have set , 
Are in a thriving plight : 
Thy heart a flour'shing Orchard is , 
A Garden of delight : 
OH , how I joy to see 
My cost not lost upon thee : 
There grows sweet Fruit on every Tree : 
The younger Plants have wone me . 
Thy Fruits of holiness , 
Are Aromatic Spices : 
Thy Garden , and thyself no lesle , 
To me a Paradise is . 
My God , how is it thus ! 
Can man relieve his Maker ! 
no ; but the grafted Cion is 
Of the Stocks life partaker . 
CANT . v. 1.  

— Eat , OH friends , drink , yea , drink abundantly , OH beloved ! 

HYMN 77.  

Come now , all you that are my Friends , 
My Church hath made a feast : 
Come fill your Souls with Nectar bowls , 
I call you with the rest . 
I 'd have you all partake of these 
Her inexhausted pleasures : 
Come eat and drink her Prayers , and sink 
Yourselves into her treasures . 
Her Lips shall feed you , and her Graces 
Their bounty shall express : 
If Angels come , they shall have some , 
And Joy to every Guest . 
Come then , you drooping Spirits , come ; 
Here is a worthy prize : 
And if you please to drink up Seas ; 
I 'll give her fresh supplies . 
Lord of all store , I thee implore ; 
Since what is thine , is mine ; 
And what is mine , is thine ; This boon 
To grant do thou incline , 
That thou wouldst fill me with thyself , 
And stretch my Soul to hold thee : 
And I shall feast me and the rest , 
With what thy Love hath told me . 
CANT . v. 2.  

I sleep , but my heart waketh — 

HYMN 78.  

I am a contradiction , Lord , 
I wake , yet am asleep : 
I am asleep , and yet I wake ; 
I both , and neither keep . 
Thus after greatest beams of Love , 
My heart grows cold again : 
As after greatest gleams of Light , 
The Heavens grow big with rain . 
When first I tasted rav'shing sweet 
From thy divinest Love , 
I thought I never more should meet 
With darkness from above . 
But now I am all Ice and Cold , 
My Zeal I cannot keep , 
As if I 'd over-drunk myself ; 
I 'm fallen fast a sleep . 
But yet my hearts awake ; I would 
Do better if I could 
The Spirit is willing , Flesh is weak ; 
OH , make me what I should . 
I would not rock myself asleep : 
If slumber overtake me , 
Rouse up my drowsy Senses , Lord , 
And by thy Power wake me . 
CANT . v. 2.  

— It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh , saying , Open unto me , my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled : for my head is filled with dew , and my locks with the drops of the night . 

HYMN 79.  

Love will not suffer drowsiness , 
But kindly wakes his sleepy Spouse : 
Thus Parents wake their children whose 
Dull inclinations cannot rouse . 
Awakening Love a Voyage took , 
In all the Rain , and in the Deep ; 
To view the World , and found that part , 
that 's called Awak'ned , fast asleep . 
Awak'ning Love the danger saw , 
How sleepy Saints unuseful were ; 
How prone the Devil was to Rob 
And spoil them of their precious ware . 
How little love to Christ there was ; 
As men asleep they mind him not : 
How soon their Temples by a Nail 
Might pierced be with deadly stroke . 
Awak'ning Love that saw things thus , 
Rouseth them first , with midnight cries ▪ 
Cries Fire , Fire , O! the Fire of Hell 
Flames out ! awake , why don't you rise ? 
That not prevailing , turns his voice 
Into a Lovers earnest cry , 
That knocks and bounceth at the door ▪ 
Cold , wet ; Awake my Love , 't is I  
CANT . v. 2.  

It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh , saying , Open to me , my Sister , my Love , my Dove , my undefiled One , etc.  

HYMN 80.  

Open thy heart , my Love , 
And let thy Jesus in : 
And why not open thy heart to me , 
As well as unto Sin ! 
Why not for me as well 
As for forbidden pleasure ! 
Shall I stand waiting at the door , 
That am thy God and Treasure ! 
Shall I , thy Lover , take 
This pains to make thee mine ; 
And shall a base and sordid Lust , 
Ensnare that heart of thine ? 
It breaks my heart to see 
My Love in Bed with Sin ; 
Whilst I the Husband am shut out , 
And may not enter in . 
My Jealous Heart and Eye 
Would prompt my Hand to take 
A Javelin up , and strike thee dead ; 
But that my Bowels ache , 
And yearn with Love and Pity : 
Rise then and let me in , 
And I 'll forgive thee all that 's past , 
And love thee well again . 
CANT . v. 2.  

It is the voice of my beloved that knocheth — 

HYMN 81.  

Hark ! drowsy Soul ! whose Voice is that ? 
Whose hand that knocks at door , 
That pleads his entrance with such charms , 
I never heard before ? 
't is my beloved's : OH that Love ! 
Now in my lapsed state , 
To call me Sister , Love , and Dove , 
And undefiled Mate ! 
That pleads his Journey , and his Locks 
Wet with the drops of Night : 
His head bedewed with rain , he fain 
Would enter if he might . 
Lord , break the door , the Spirit saith , 
The Flesh won't let me rise : 
Burst all the Locks and Bolts , and come , 
The Flesh cries otherwise . 
Come Jesus , sweet , and let us meet , 
The better part saith , Come ; 
But Flesh and Pleasure cries , no , no , 
no , no! there is no room . 
My God , shall Flesh prevail ? 't will be 
If thou standest neuter here , 
As Candle by a snuff kept down , 
That fain would upward soar . 
CANT . v. 3.  

I have put off my coat , how shall I put it on ? 
I have washed my feet , how shall I defile them ? 


HYMN 82.  

Canst thou not rise , my Love ? I ran 
To help when thou wert cast . 
My dearest Lord , I cannot Can , 
Flesh chains me down so fast . 
wilt thou not rise , my Dove ? I rose 
When dead , to make thee rise : 
My Lord , I cannot will ; This Flesh 
So hard upon me lies . 
't is night ! 't is dark ! my coat is off , 
How can I put it on ? 
My feet are washed , and should I rise , 
And make them foul anon ? 
Thus Eve her Figleaves stitched together ; 
The Bidden made excuses : 
The mild and gentle Jesus stands , 
And puts up all abuses . 
I might have said , Can it be Night , 
When day is at the door ? 
Or dark , when he that is the Light , 
Can darkness overpow'r ? 
I have put off my Coat ; and can't 
I put it on as soon ? 
Affronted thus , my Jesus , cried , 
Farewell my Love , I 'm gone ! 
CANT . v. 4.  

My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door , and my bowels were moved for him . 

HYMN 83.  

AS men are wont , when taking leave , 
To wave the hand to parting friend : 
I saw him do 't , my heart did heave , 
And all my bowels did extend . 
My Jesus ! I shall never forget 
That dreadful black and sad surprise : 
I would have rose with all my heart , 
But at the present could not rise . 
My bowels sounded , when I saw 
His beck'ning hand a farewell give : 
I thought I should have died to see 
Him wave his hand , and take his leave . 
As frighted men in dreams would speak , 
But have not power to speak a word : 
My heart assayed , to pray him stay ; 
My moving bowels all concurred . 
I haled for breath , and would have cried , 
Stay Lord , I come ! but could not utter : 
I plainly saw my loss would be , 
Like riches running down a Gutter . 
My Soul , these damps and dreadful cramps , 
Contract the Sinews of the best : 
My God appear , to me draw near , 
When such Temptations me infest . 
CANT . v. 5.  

I rose up to open to my beloved , and my hands dropped with myrrh ▪ and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh , upon the handles of the lock . 

HYMN 84.  

I Rose , I went , I opened the door ; 
But I delayed too long 
My dearest Lord was gone before , 
Distated at this wrong . 
Yet left a sweet presume behind ; 
The sign he had been there : 
no sooner had I touched the Lock , 
My hands dropped down with myrrh . 
He left me not , till I him left : 
And never left me so : 
But left a virtue still behind , 
To sweeten all my wo. 
Thus Lovers will absent , but then 
Tokens shall blow the Flames , 
And keep the Fire of Love alive , 
And quicken the remains . 
My God my heart 's a rusty Lock , 
Oil it with Grace Divine : 
My heart is more , a chained door ; 
Burst up this Heart of mine . 
Lay thy perfuming hand upon it , 
And drop thy sweetness in : 
'T will fire my longings to thyself ; 
'T will out with Sloth and Sin.  
CANT . v. 6.  

I opened to my beloved , but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he spoke — 

HYMN 85.  

Jesus withdraws ! Thus when the Sun 
Doth bid the World good-night ; 
It leaves it in a Dark and most 
Uncomfortable plight . 
That word , I 'm gone ! that kill word , 
My heart did rend and tear : 
I little thought his words were Swords ; 
Delays denials were . 
I rose , but he was gone from thence , 
And left me all alone : 
I never thought , I 'll rise anon , 
Did Tantamount , Be gone : 
If tears would fetch him back , I 'd weep 
A Sea to waft him over ; 
If prayers , I 'd rend the Skies with cries , 
But I 'd regain my Lover : 
Woe , and alas ! my woeful case ; 
Now am I left alone . 
In Fears and Cares , and thousand Tears , 
My Sorrows to bemoan . 
All you that have a Soul to save , 
Take warning by my fall : 
Make no delays , give him no Nay's ; 
Rise when you hear him call . 
CANT . v. 6.  

— I sought him , but I could not find him : I called him , but he gave me no answer . 

HYMN 86.  

ALL you whose tender bowels yearn , 
At full grown misery : 
Lament my case , my blubbered face , 
And pity , pity me . 
I pray to him that heareth prayers ; 
But mine he will not hear . 
He hath a bottle for all Tears , 
But mine must not come there . 
I sought him that is found of All 
That seek him heartily : 
But , OH my pain ! I seek in vain ; 
My coming makes him fly . 
He that once loved my Soul , is gone ▪ 
Whose love was sweet as Wine . 
I call him Love , he calls me Dog ; 
Was ever grief like mine ! 
My Soul , it was thy Sin , thy Sloth , 
That driven thy Christ away : 
He called , but failed ; and 't is but just , 
Such slight to repay . 
There never was ( except 't were his ) 
A grief that bodes so ill : 
My Soul ! when he writes , Seek no more 
Do thou read , Seek me still . 
CANT . v. 7.  

The watchmen that went about the City , found me ; they smote me , they wounded me ; the keepers of the Walls took away my vail from me . 

HYMN 87.  

Thus when the anchor 's lost , 
The ship 's exposed to Waves , 
With surly Winds and Billows tossed , 
Like greedy open Graves . 
As when the wounded Deer , 
Bleeds with the Arrow shot : 
The rest forsake and come not near , 
And blood ▪ hounds take their lot . 
I got me up , and went 
Jerusalem's Streets about ; 
With a most full and true intent , 
To find my Jesus out . 
The Watchmen were unkind , 
They smite me , wound and hale : 
The Keepers of the City-walls , 
They took away my Veil . 
And this by Watchmen too ! 
Church ▪ Officers they were , 
That should have led me unto Christ , 
Wound me for coming there . 
And Keepers of the Walls , 
The Kingdom's Magistrates : 
Treat me as bad , as if I had 
Done Whoredom in their Gates . 
OH what a darksome Night , 
When those that pray and fear , 
Shall be pursued by Law and Spite , 
As Thiefs and Robbers are ! 
CANT . v. 8.  

I charge you , OH daughters of Jerusalem , if ye find my beloved , that ye tell him , that I am sick of love . 

HYMN 88  

ye common People of the City , 
From great ones I Address to you : 
The Priests and Rulers have no pity ; 
They serve my Lord unkindly too . 
If you , or any of you be 
Engaged in this design with me , 
To seek a Jesus , ( you may find him ; ) 
Not I that did so little mind him . 
then tell him , tell him , I am sick 
With Love , and longing for his Presence . 
Tell him , my Zeal is burning quick ; 
Tell him he is my All , my Essence . 
If all the World were Gold , and mine , 
I 'd give it all for one sweet smile : 
could Sufferings fetch him back , I 'd bear 
The very Pains of Hell a while . 
My life 's a Death , unless my Lord , 
Will show himself again to me . 
My Death were Life , would he accord 
To lead me where I might him see . 
Since thou canst hide thyself from me , 
Where I may seek and never find thee ; 
But I can't hide myself from thee : 
Sweet Jesus seek me , till thou find me . 
CANT . v. 9  

What is thy beloved more than another beloved , OH thou fairest among Women ? what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou dost so charge us ? 

HYMN 89.  

Fairest of Women , tell us , who 
This thy Beloved is , 
For whom thou makest this ado , 
By such a charge as this . 
What is his Name ? what is his Fame ? 
Pray let us understand ? 
we 'll seek him too , if all be true , 
And seek him out of hand . 
There is beloved Health and Wealth , 
There are beloved Pleasures , 
There are beloved Friends and Ends , 
There are beloved Treasures . 
There a beloved Temple stands , 
A lovely Structure 't is : 
There are beloved means of Grace ; 
Tell which of these it is : 
OH what is thy Beloved , that 
Nothing but him can please thee ! 
And what are these complaints , ye Saints ▪ 
That none but he can ease ye ? 
Are you of men the only wise ? 
Must Wisdom die with you ? 
Discover thy Beloved Prize , 
And tell us what , and who . 
CANT . v. 10.  

My beloved is white and ruddy , the chiefest among ten thousand . 

HYMN 90.  

Thou bottomless Abyss of Love ! 
OH help me now to set thee forth . 
Give Inspirations from above , 
And let me stammer out thy worth . 
Look how well tempered white and red , 
Sets out the beauty of the Face ! 
In him all beauty sits enthroned , 
And all Perfections take their place . 
White as the Light ; and God is Light ; 
This Tincture speaks him perfect God : 
red , as was Adam's Earth ; it speaks 
Manhood , in which that God abode . 
But White and Ruddy , both in one , 
Speaks him a Person , God and Man : 
The white , the badge of Innocence , 
Never was black , nor never can . 
But red as blood , and red with blood , 
Drawn by the sins that we lay in . 
The white breaths Joy & Peace to Saints , 
The red breaths blood to sinful men . 
This is the Man whose absence kills me ; 
Chiefest of thousands he 's to me : 
This is the man whose presence fills me : 
O! could I meet him ! where is he ? 
CANT . v. 11.  

His head is as the most fine Gold — 

HYMN 91.  

HIS Head the seat of Wisdom is , 
Most lovely to behold : 
His Understanding infinite , 
Shines like the purest Gold. 
This head of his is lifted up 
Above the starry Skies , 
When all his Enemies' heads lie low , 
Shall sink , and never rise . 
He is the head of all his Saints 
By way of Eminence , 
more worth than all their body is , 
As Gold to single-pences . 
He is the Church's head , from whence , 
By way of Influence , 
As from a Spring of Life they have 
Their motion , strength , and sense . 
The head of Powers , which he rules 
By Sceptre and his Rod : 
OH what a glorious head hath he ! 
The head of Christ is God 
Wonder not at me then , if I 
Complain as almost dead ; 
For I have lost my God , my King ; 
OH , I have lost my Head ! 
CANT . v. 11.  

— His locks are bushy , and black as a Raven . 

HYMN 92.  

HIS locks ( not worn for Pride , 
Nor yet to set out sin ; 
Nor yet to vaunt a swelling Tide 
Of naughtiness within ) 
Speak him a Nazarite ; 
no Razor shaves his Head , 
Serving the Lord with all his might : 
A Separate indeed . 
His vow of separation 
Lays strongest bonds upon him ; 
He shall be called a Nazarite , 
His locks shall well become him : 
His locks are curled and black , 
The vigour of his strength 
Will make his Enemies go to wrack , 
And quell his Foes at length . 
You glory in your Hair , 
The curl of your Tresses ; 
Come lay aside your filthy Pride , 
And to him make Addresses . 
This is the man I want ; 
This Person I must have : 
OH , I must quickly find him out , 
Or I must find my Grave . 
CANT . v. 12.  

His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters , washed with milk , and fitly set . 

HYMN 93.  

I 'll tell you farther , That if such 
A Person you shall see , 
Whose eyes like Doves are washed with milk 
And water ; This is Herald 
He hath a kill eye , will pierce 
Through Adamantine Ears , 
And wound a Rock but with a look , 
And melt it into Tears . 
Eyes that are clear , and fitly set , 
That can see all things past , 
And all things present , and to come , 
As long as time shall last : 
Whose eyes are purely chaste : That never 
Opened to let in sin ; 
That never did the least endeavour 
To take foul objects in . 
If such a one you meet , whose eyes 
Like flames and lamps of fire 
Strike dead , and yet give Life ; that do 
confound , yet stir desire . 
This is the man I seek ; a man 
Allseeing , and All-eye ; 
Tell him , if such a one you meet , 
't is for his Love I die . 
CANT . v. 13.  

His cheeks are as a bed of spices , as sweet flowers : his lips like lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh . 

HYMN 94.  

HIS cheeks two fragrant beauties are , 
Whose Odoriferous smell 
Like beds of spices fresh and rare , 
So sweet no tongue can tell . 
Or like the richest flowers in May , 
Whose scent perfumes the Air ; 
Whose colours beautify the day , 
And all men's wonder are . 
His lips are lily-white , and fair , 
The products of them sweet ; 
His Counsels , Kisses , Comforts , Calls , 
All Cordials in them meet . 
The man that spoke as no man spoke , 
Each word an Oracle ; 
The man that spoke , and never hath ▪ 
Transgressed a syllable . 
Your Popes and Councils all have erred , 
Those glittering trifles all ; 
But my Beloved's lips never moved 
Amiss , nor never shall . 
This is the man my Soul seeks ; o ! 
That I could see that Face ! 
Them Ruby Cheeks and Lips again , 
In some due time and place ! 
CANT . v. 14.  

His hands are as gold-rings set with the beryl : his belly is as bright Ivory overlaid with saphires . 

HYMN 95.  

Hands that have made the Heavens' all , 
And all the Hosts therein : 
That made the Sun , the Moon , the Stars , 
And you and me , and men . 
And when the work was spoilt quite , 
And overturned by sin : 
These hands of his went fresh to work , 
And made all up again : 
His Belly , where his Bowels dwell , 
Are working out our aid ; 
Like Treasures in an Ivory box , 
With Saphires overlaid . 
Yearns to distressed Souls , that be ; 
His heart within him rolls : 
He mindeth not his own concerns , 
But sinner's case condoles . 
'T was Bowels nailed him to the Cross , 
'T was Bowels made him die ; 
'T was Bowels set his Blood abroach 
For such a one as I 
He pity's all the World , and all 
His suffering Saints : But he 
Had no Compassion for himself : 
OH , hath he none for me ! 
CANT . v. 15.  

His legs are as pillars of marble , set upon sockets of fine gold — 

HYMN 96.  

His Legs like marble pillars , set 
On Sockets of the finest Gold : 
The man I seek , and can't forget , 
bears up himself , and all the World , 
Upon the basis of his strength , 
Supported are all things that be : 
Their heights & depths , their breadth and length ; 
Who Heaven and Earth sustains , that 's he . 
His People and their Graces stand , 
Not on their own Legs , but on his : 
Moore firm than ever Adam did , 
That walked the rounds of Paradise . 
Those little Pillars soon let fall , 
What was entrusted to their power : 
But on this Marble pillar shall 
His Saints be kept till their last hour . 
Jehovah Shaddai , is his name ; 
The strong and mighty God is he ; 
There is no Tongue can speak his fame , 
The best but lisp his dignity . 
This is my well beloved one ; 
In all the World there 's not the like : 
This is the man for whom alone , 
I am in this distressed plight . 
CANT . v. 16.  

— His countenance is as Lebanon , excellent as the Cedars . 

HYMN 97.  

His Countenance , who looks upon it , 
Takes prospect of fair Lebanon . 
The objects were presented from it , 
Dazzled the Eyes of lookers on . 
The various lofty Cedars there , 
And several sorts of other Trees . 
The Aromatic Fruits , there , were 
Graceful and grateful to the Eyes : 
Yet nothing like the prospect which 
His shining Countenance sends forth : 
So fair , so beautiful , so rich : 
OH , how shall I advance his worth ? 
OH that I could but see that face , 
That once so strongly drew my heart ! 
OH that I could enjoy that place , 
That once I had beyond desert ! 
But I have lost him , he is gone , 
Which makes my Eyes run down with tears : 
I cannot find him ; left alone , 
I 'm almost drowned in doubts and fears . 
Yet this I 'll say , I feel his hand , 
Although I cannot see his face , 
And in his Presence still I stand , 
And he supports me with his Grace . 
CANT . v. 16.  

His mouth is most sweet : yea , he is altogether lovely . This is my beloved , and this is my friend , OH ye daughters of Jerusalem . 

HYMN 98.  

THE gracious words that drop 
From his sweet Mouth , so free ; 
Are sweeter than the sweets , that top , 
Sweetness itself to me ▪ 
In short , this is the man , 
he 's altogether love , 
And altogether lovely ; can 
You find me such a Dove ? 
You Daughters , this is he : 
This my Beloved is : 
no tongue can teach , no Language can 
Express that love of his . 
The drops that fills the Seas , 
Go count them one by one , 
then join the number , if you please , 
Of Stars , till there be none . 
To these the Sands , the Hairs , 
All th' objects of the sight ; 
Hyperbolise Immensity , 
And run to Infinite . 
This my beloved is : 
He is the Total Sum 
Of all perfection ; and the Bliss 
Of all that to him come .

whither is thy beloved gone , OH thou fairest among women ? whither is thy beloved turned aside ? that we may seek him with thee ? 

HYMN 99  

Strange character , as ever we heard ! 
But is he so indeed ? 
we 'll seek him too , if this be true , 
we 'll seek him with all speed . 
This is the Man that only can 
Put all things out of doubt : 
That will be Joy , and Heaven to us , 
If we can find him out : 
Come then and let 's together seek him , 
As ▪ hungry men their food . 
And if it be our Bliss to meet him , 
he 'll be our chiefest good . 
OH how our hearts are set on fire ! 
Pray help us seek him too : 
OH how we burn with hot desire ! 
we 'll seek as well as you : 
My soul ! desires get desires , 
As Bellowss blow the Flame ; 
As I have seen , where wood is green 
And Coals to Billets came . 
't is all the glory Mortals can , 
Bring to the blessed Jesus , 
To others to commend his Name , 
Whose matchless worth will please us . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 50.  

IS this the Christ — The lover of thy soul ? 
Is this the Blessed — Whose loss thou dost condole ? 
These praises high — Have set our hearts on fire : 
Let us come nigh — We burn with hot desire . 
we 'll seek him too — We know not where to mend us , 
we 'll go with you — If you 'll so far befriend us . 
OH happy day — That ere we met with you , 
To lead the way — If what you speak be true : 
This is the man — If we can find him out , 
That only can — Put all things out of doubt : 
OH , this is he — Whom if we find , we find 
All things that be — And can enrich the mind . 
My Soul ! 't is good — Desires get desires ; 
't is others food — As fire kindles fires : 
Thus have I seen — The Bellowss raise a flame , 
When wood was green — And Coals to Billets came . 
't is all the glory — Poor Worms can bring to Jesus , 
To lay before ye — The matchless worth may please us ▪

My beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the garden , and to gather lilies . 

HYMN 100  

Come then , and let us go 
Into his Gardens , where 
The Spices smell , and Lilies grow ▪ 
And we shall find him there . 
Where fruitful People meet , 
As Lily-roots abound : 
In Beds all placed , and Spices sweet , 
There he is to be found . 
Where he may feast himself 
With most Divine delight , 
And have the sweetest tastes of love ; 
Where Saints meet in his sight . 
Where holiness abounds , 
And where his Spirit breathes , 
And where his Father's Praises sounds ; 
With these his Life he leads . 
Come then , and let us go , 
And leave these barren Fields ! 
For here 's no Flower , no Fruit , and so 
Nothing true Pleasure yields . 
The world 's a barren Heath ; 
The Church his Garden is , 
And all his Saints are all his Plants ; 
His Presence is their bliss . 
CANT . VI 3.  

I am my beloved's , and my beloved is mine : he feedeth among the lilies .

OH What a mercy'tis , that I 
Deserted thus , should feel a glance 
Of love dart from his pleasing eye , 
Thus wounded by desertions lance ! 
i  lost him ; yet I find a ray , 
That drives my fright and fears away : 
Howe ▪ re , I pine in bitterness ; 
I 'm sure he 's mine , and I am his . 
Thus have I seen a sudden ray , 
Dispel the Clouds and gilled the day . 
Under Vine-leaves a cluster hid , 
And faith that can all fears outbid . 
How bright is Faith in Bridal-robe , 
Whose language is , My Lord , my God 
My Christ , whom I Monopolise , 
And can him call my only prize ! 
There is in that same pronoun My , 
A choice and sweet Divinity . 
What is a glorious God to me , 
If I can't lay my claim to thee ? 
I say , he 's mine , and I am his , 
And humbly seal it with a kiss : 
Angels , is Heaven for none but you ? 
O! this to me is Heaven too . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 50.  

Bless me my God — What beam of Heaven is this ? 
Displayed abroad — The day desertion is : 
i  lost my Love — And yet I find a ray , 
Dart from above — That drives my frights away . 
I 'm sure he 's mine — I am sure I am his : 
Howe'er I pine — And mourn in Bitterness . 
Thus have I seen — The Sun by sudden ray ; 
The clouds contemn — And shine and gilled the day . 
There is a cluster — Under the Vine-leaves hid , 
When faith shall muster — And false fears outbid . 
How bright is Faith — When in the Bridal-robe , 
A full blown Faith — Whose Language is , My God. 
My Christ is all — Whom I Monopolise , 
And can him call — My Love , my only Prize , 
And say , I know — he 's mine , and I am his : 
And in it grow — Sealed with a holy kiss . 
Angels admire — Is Heaven for none but you ? 
Let me aspire — OH , this is Heaven too !

thou art beautiful , my love , as Tirzah : as comely as Jerusalem : terrible as an army with banners . 

HYMN 102.  

I 'll now unveil myself , 
I 'll cloud my love no longer , 
I 'll now appear to quench your thirst , 
And satisfy your hunger . 
I love those holy Fires , 
That kept themselves alive ; 
When almost drowned with Seas of Tears , 
Thy Graces yet did thrive . 
thou art all fair , my Love ; 
thou art so very comely : 
thou art to me so beautiful , 
That I admire thee only . 
Like Tirzah's famous City , 
Where Kings did keep their Courts , 
Or like that fair Jerusalem , 
Whose strong impregnant forts ; 
Whose terror struck their foes , 
Made them to fly the place : 
Such is thy Valour , OH my Love , 
Such Thunder in thy Face . 
Rome , Hell , the World and Flesh , 
The Devil , Death and Sin : 
Under thy Hand do trembling stand , 
Such terrors are they in . 
It was my strength , not thine , 
That bore so dark a test : 
The strength is mine , by which thou shalt 
Soon vanquish all the rest . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 104.  

Thou art fair , my Love , 
thou art very comely , 
thou art beautiful ; 
I admire thee only . 
Tirzah's famous City , 
Where Kings kept their Courts , 
Makes me think on thee , 
Whose impregnant forts 
Terror-strike thy Foes , 
Conquer all that come ; 
With thy Swords and Shields , 
Battering Hell and Rome . 
World , Flesh , Devil , and 
Sin , Death , trembling stand : 
Nothing stands before 
Thy Victorious hand . 
Thy Arms Armies are , 
Thy Faith a sharp Spear . 
All thy Graces are 
Swords to make them fear : 
Such art thou , my Love , 
With thee is my strength : 
Armed by me , thou shalt 
Conquer all at length . 
CANT . VI 5.  

Turn away thine eyes from me , for they have overcome him — 

HYMN 103.  

Saint , turn away thine eyes from me , 
For they do overcome me . 
Thy piercing Eye-beams wound my heart ; 
Turn them , OH turn them from me . 
't is not thy fleshly Eyes , my Dear , 
For they are my disgust : 
no better they then filthy Sties , 
And Caterers for Lust . 
But 't is those inward Eyes that pierce me ; 
Those souly beams of Light , 
That searching eye of strong Desire , 
That found me in the Night . 
That shot its rays about the dark , 
And sparkled all with Fire : 
And that same Eye of Faith it was 
The life of that desire , 
That was so restless , till it found 
It's truly longed-for Jesus ; 
And was well-nigh in sorrow drowned , 
Till I had said , I 'll ease you . 
Eyes that were turned unto me , 
When I was turned from thee , 
Have made me fear the letting out 
Of too much Love upon thee . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 104.  

Turn away thine eyes , 
They do overcome me : 
Beauty in them lies , 
Matchless ; turn them from me . 
Eyes are tempting things , 
Mortals find them so ▪ 
Eyes have conquered Kings , 
Brought their Sceptres low . 
't is not fleshly Eyes , 
They are my disgust : 
They are sinful Sties , 
They are darts of Lust . 
That Eye of Desire , 
That did find me out : 
And sparkling with fire , 
Shot its rays about . 
Restless , till it found 
It's beloved Jesus , 
And in Sorrow drowned , 
Till I said , I 'll ease you . 
That same Eye of Faith , 
Whose bright darts could kill 
All that Sorrow , saith , 
Hopeless trusting still . 
Eyes that turned to me , 
When I turned away : 
OH , these eyes undo me , 
Conquering get the day . 
I fear , OH my Saints , 
I should Love too much : 
My heart strongly pants ; 
Love to you is such . 
CANT . VI 5.  

— Thy hair is a flock of goats that appear from mount Gilead . 

HYMN 104.  

Now I will praise her for her hair , 
The modest covering of her head ; 
The emblem of that Loyalty , 
That in subjection's hand is lead . 
Her hairs like Counters ; cast the sum , 
Numberless numbers of her sins , 
And having washed my feet with tears , 
With hairs to wipe them she begins . 
The Goats on Gileads mountains bear 
A long and soft , and useful hair : 
But no such Hair as hers , whose tresses 
Adorns her face with pleasing dresses . 
Wo to the Crown of Pride , whose hair , 
Whose long and bushy Locks declare , 
A brutish Custom every where , 
And only used for a Snare . 
The long haired Gallants of these times , 
Wear Horses mains on human Faces : 
Turn men to Monsters , and the work 
Of God and Nature much disgraces . 
God in a bush did once appear , 
But in their bush hath never been ▪ 
they 'll never leave till Satan come , 
And thrust a burning Candle in . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 111.  

The covering of her head , 
With which she is bestead . 
Her hair ▪ the emblem is 
Of lovely Loyalty ; 
Subjection under me : 
OH what an honour ' 't is ! 
With these she casts the sums , 
As well it ▪ her becomes , 
The number of her sins ; 
And having washed my feet , 
With hair , a Towel meet , 
To wipe them she begins . 
Wo to the Crown of Pride , 
Who to her Sins beside , 
Hath added every where , 
Such loathsome heads of hair , 
Used only for a Snare , 
To those that foolish are . 
That marry Horfes mains , 
To human Heads ▪ whose gains 
They must receive in Hell : 
God in a Bush was seen , 
But never hath he been , 
Where this proud Bush doth dwell . 
CANT . VI 6.  

Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep , which goeth up from the washing , whereof every one beareth twins , and there is not one barren among them . 

HYMN 105.  

MY Spouse , I 'll add , to praise thee more , 
And will repeat again : 
Think not , that I 'll abate my Love , 
Distasted at thy sin . 
Those teeth are washed and double set , 
They eat my Flesh and Blood : 
I am thy spiritual food of Life , 
I am thy chiefest good . 
Thy grinders are thy Faith in me , 
Thy Faith a stomach hath . 
OH , how I love to see thee seed ! 
How lovely is thy Faith ? 
I 'll wash thy teeth in Milk , and be 
A Breast , a Feast , a Table , 
A Saviour to thy Faith and Thee : 
Fear not , for I am able . 
I 'll make thy Faith bring forth her fruits , 
As twinning Sheep their young : 
I 'll water both the stem and roots , 
And then I 'll freely come : 
I 'll come with joy and great delight , 
To see my Flocks a feeding , 
As Shepherds use ; I 'll bless my sight , 
To see my Sheep a breeding . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 111.  

I 'll praise my Church yet more , 
To what I said before ; 
I will repeat again , 
She shall not think that I , 
'Cause she was faulty , fly , 
Or in Affection wane . 
Her teeth wherewith she chews 
Her food , that Life renews , 
Are washed and double set ; 
I am her spiritual food , 
I am her chiefest good : 
I 'll never her forget . 
Her grinders are her Faith , 
Her Faith a stomach hath , 
To feed upon my Flesh ; 
The washing is my blood : 
I 'll cleanse her in that flood , 
And so her soul refresh . 
Her Faith is fruitful too , 
more than false faith can do , 
Or barren doubts and fears : 
She eats my Flesh , and drinks 
My Blood , and no man thinks 
What lovely Fruit she bears . 
CANT . VI 7.  

As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks . 

HYMN 106.  

Have you not been , where you have seen 
The red and blushing Pomgranate , 
All overspread with Rosy-red , 
As nature's bounty did create ? 
Her Face a Virgin's blush adorns , 
Spread with all ruby bashfulness : 
A Face of Brass she highly scorns , 
But comeliness commends her dress . 
no crisp profanes her modest hair ; 
Content with Nature's Ornament . 
She scorns to go profanely bare ; 
Or give to Pride a foolish vent . 
't is Nature , not base Art adorns her : 
no Hypocrite in Face or Heart ; 
A painted piece , Religion scorns her ; 
The Hypocrite and God must part . 
She blusheth , ' cause she cannot blush ; 
And fears , because she fears no more . 
Sense of her Sin doth always flush 
Her modest Face , and grieve her sore . 
My Soul ! this Consternation due , 
Becomes the holy Virgin-bride ; 
Of that same bleeding Lover who 
For thy Salvation gladly died 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 112.  

Have you not been where you have seen , 
The red and blushing Pomegranate , 
All overspread with Rosy-red , 
As Nature's bounty did create ? 
Thy Cheeks and Temples , OH my Spouse , 
Modesty crowns , and so thy Brows : 
Thy Face a Virgin-blush adorns 
Spread with a ruby bashfulness ; 
A face of Brass thou highly scorns , 
But comeliness commends thy dress . 
Thy Gild and Sin in which to blame , 
As with a Pencil paints thy shame . 
no Crisp profanes thy modest hair ; 
Content with Nature's Ornament ▪ 
thou scornest to go profanely bare ▪ 
Or give to pride a foolish vent : 
't is Nature , not base Art adorns thee : 
A painted piece , Religion scorns thee . 
My Soul this consternation due 
Becomes the holy Virgin-bride , 
Of that same bleeding Lover who , 
For thy Salvation gladly died . 
Bold steps in Sin , let me not trace ; 
But guilty , hide my blushing Face . 
CANT . VI 8.  

There are threescore queens , and fourscore concubines , and virgins without number . 

Verse . 9 My dove , my undefiled is but one : she is the only one of her mother , she is the choice one of her that bore her . 



HYMN 107.  

I am no Bigamist , 
I have no Concubines , 
it 's only one Church I admit ; 
One Child ; I have no Twins : 
My Church is more to me , 
And so she ever shall , 
Than all things in the world that be , 
could I prevail at all . 
could I but gain her Love , 
My heart would Captive be , 
And all my Pains , would be my gains , 
My Cross , my Melody . 
Let there be Threescore Queens , 
And Fourscore Concubines , 
And Virgins numberless , that catch 
Fools in their snaring gins . 
My Loved is but one , 
That one is more than they : 
There is more worth in her alone : 
The Sun 't is makes it day , 
Away false Beauties all , 
My loved one , is One ; 
I love but one , and she shall call 
Herself , my Spouse alone . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 113.  

MY Church is more to me than all 
The things that are , or ever shall : 
My heart 's a Captive to her Love , 
I 'm held in these desired chains , 
As recompensed for all my pains ; 
could I but her Affections move . 
Let there be Threescore Queens in Thrones , 
And Fourscore Concubines at once , 
And Virgins numberless also , 
This one of mine outshines the Day , 
She is but one , yet more than they ; 
And more to me , as Angels know . 
Thus several Members in one Man , 
Epitomised into a span , 
Concentre still to make him one : 
Thus Seas have many Rivers , yet 
All these in the same Ocean met , 
Make up but one Reception : 
So is my undefiled Love , 
Kingdoms her greater Members prove , 
And lesser Churches are her parts ; 
And every Saint a Member is : 
And they are many , yet all this 
Is but one Center-nest of hearts . 
CANT . VI 9  

The Daughters saw her , and blessed her ; yea , the queens and the concubines , and they praised her . 

HYMN 108.  

How lovely are my precious Saints 
In others Eyes , as well as mine ! 
Let Baalam speak : or else let those 
That never found her yet Divine ! 
't is easy to commend the way : 
no man can speak against the Truth ; 
The natural Conscience hath a ray : 
But happy he , the Chase pursu'th : 
't is hard to yield the heart : but why 
Should not the heart be yielded ? when 
The way of Saints , the best of ways , 
And they are sure the best of Men. 
And why not yield the heart ? when as 
The God of Saints , the best of Gods , 
And his Love is the best of Loves , 
And their Loves are the best , by odds ? 
Come all ye Angels of the Heavens , 
Come all the World , I 'll join with you : 
Come help me Love , my loved Prize : 
I love her ; do you Love her too . 
Let Queens admire their own desires : 
And Concubines their lustful fires : 
I 'll love my own , and only Love , 
And nothing shall my Heart remove . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 113.  

The people saw her sparkling Rays , 
And did upon her Beauty gaze , 
And called my Church a blessed one : 
And Queeus and Concubines , whose hearts 
Had never felt what love imparts , 
Yet spoke her commendation . 
Thus Baalam cried , How comely are 
Thy Tents , OH Israel ? how fair ? 
Yet had no heart to yield the fort . 
't is easy to commend the way ; 
The natural conscience hath a ray : 
But O! 't is hard to yield the heart . 
And why not yield the heart now ? When 
My Saints are sure the best of men ; 
And this their way the best of ways . 
Their God the best of gods , and when 
Their Work the best of works , and then 
The best of Joys for endless days ? 
Let Queens admire their own desires , 
And Concubines their lustful fires , 
And Virgins dote on whom they please . 
I 'll love my own and only Love , 
And nothing shall my heart remove ; 
't is thine my Dove , here take the Keys . 
CANT . VI 10.  

Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , terrible as an army with banners ? 

HYMN 109.  

Welcome the time , that brings the news , 
Of the Returning of the Jews : 
Whose Kings are all in Armour dressed , 
And Zions foes are dispossessed . 
A new created people , which 
Unlookt-for , shall the World enrich , 
And give my Foes a final fall , 
And make the Nations tremble all . 
This is the lovely Morning-light , 
That breaks out of a darksome Night ; 
And gradually advanceth forth , 
Like to the sun 's resplendent worth . 
Heirs of the Promise , though kept out ; 
Whose are the Covenants , no doubt , 
Thomas long sequestered for their sin , 
And sad the case that they were in . 
Lo , now the Morning twilight dawns , 
And they come marching o'er the lawns . 
Equiped for blood , like men of War ; 
Their sleeping Souls awak'ned are . 
OH , what a glorious sight is this ! 
OH what a heart-rejoicing ' 't is ! 
That those that at a distance stood ; 
Return the purchase of my blood ! 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 113.  

News from the Confines of the East , 
There Kings in Armour all are dressed , 
To make the Nations tremble all . 
A new created People , which 
Unlook for , shall the World enrich , 
And give my Foes a final fall . 
This is a lovely Morning light , 
That breaks out of a darksome Night , 
And gradually advanceth forth : 
First , as the Moon in dusky fair , 
then as the Sun with light most clear : 
who 's this ? and what her splendent worth ? 
Heirs of the Promise , though kept out ; 
Whose are the Covenants , no doubt , 
Thomas long sequestered for their sin . 
Lo , now the Morning twilight dawns , 
And they come marching o'er the lawns , 
From out the Dungeons they were in . 
O! what a glorious sight is this ? 
O! what a heart-rejoicing 't is , 
That now the purchase of my Blood , 
In all my Saints completed is , 
And Jews and Gentiles coalesce , 
That heretofore at distance stood ! 
CANT . VI 11.  

I went down into the Garden of Nuts , to see the fruits of the Valley , and to see whether the Vine flourished , and the Pomegranates budded . 

HYMN 110.  

Rouse thee , OH Israel , 
Child of the Valley , where , 
Put from the presence of the mate ; 
Sad thy rejectings were . 
OH thou hast been to me , 
Garden of Nuts : so hard , 
So dry , such husky Shells ; from thee 
All comforts were debarred . 
There was a Kernal , but 
There was no coming at it ; 
By unbelief thou wert , as if 
For thy destruction fatted . 
At last I heard in thee , 
A rattling of the bones , 
As if they would together come ; 
And real sighs and groans . 
I will go down and see 
Whether the Vines are good , 
And Grapes abound , and give us hopes , 
And the Pomegranates bud . 
If so , the work is done ; 
Thy Foes are put to flight : 
To Rocks and Mountains they shall run , 
For shelter , if they might . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 124 ▪ 

O Israel , 
Child of the Valley , where 
no Tongue can tell , 
what 's thy afflicted state , 
Sequestered from 
The presence of thy Mate : 
Whose doom was just , 
For casting off my fear , 
And me so soon , 
Hence thy rejectings were . 
thou 'st been to me , 
Garden of Nuts so hard , 
So dry , such Husks , 
Couldst not be opened : 
Kernel there was , 
But none upon it fed : 
Thy unbelief 
Did thy return retard ; 
And slighting me , 
Thy Prayer was not heard . 
At last , I hear 
A rattling of the Bones , 
As if they 'd come 
Together suddenly : 
Thy God will come , 
And see how all things lie ▪ 
Is it a thing 
that 's real ? Are there groans , 
And tears , and fruits , 
And supplications ? 
OH , doth the Vine 
Flourish ! the Grapes abound , 
And give us hopes ! 
Do the Pomegrantes' bud ? 
Hath God inspired 
Their hearts with real good ? 
Thy God will come , 
If these be in thee found , 
And lead thee forth ; 
With safety thee surround . 
CANT . VI 12.  

Or ever I was aware , my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib . 

HYMN 111.  

ZION awake ! the day is come ; 
Rouse as a Lion from thy den : 
th' alarm sounds , that never did yet : 
My Spirit is up . Awaken then : 
You Angels get your Chariots ready , 
Prepare you for this longed-for day : 
Hast , hast , come , I am dressed already ; 
My soul 's a wing , I cannot stay . 
Amminadibs' Chariots driven fast ; 
But never driven so fast as mine : 
Amminadib was not in such haste , 
Nor flew so fast on wings of time . 
A willing God , a willing People , 
Both hot upon the same design ; 
they 're both agreed ; there 's not a scruple , 
To interpose to while off time . 
Our Hearts are swifter than our Charets ; 
we 'll both conspire from our places : 
thou here , and I from lofty Garrets , 
we 'll lift this World from of its basis . 
My Soul admire ! what hast he speeds , 
To fetch his Captives out of thrall ? 
With winged flames to help their needs , 
That pickled lay in Salt and Gall.  
Another to the Tune of Psal . 124.  

Rouse ! there is life , 
The longed-for day is come : 
th' Alarm sounds , 
Where it never sounded yet : 
Their hearts have ears , 
they 're pierced to the quick . 
I 'll now go down , 
And do what 's to be done ; 
My heart 's on fire ▪ 
I 'll be their Light and Sun. 
You blessed Angels , get you Chariots ready : 
My Royal Spirit 
Is up , I must away : 
My Soul is all 
A-wing , I cannot stay : 
Amminadib , 
That driven so fast and steady , 
Had not my haste : 
Come , I am dressed already . 
A willing God , 
And willing People met , 
With resolutions stronger than the Charets ▪ 
They from below , 
I from my lofty Garrets ▪ 
OH , what a great 
day 's this , When in a net , 
This wicked World , 
My Foes , are all beset ! 
My Soul admire ! 
With what a hast he speeds , 
To fetch his Poor , 
His Captives out of thrall , 
This many years , 
Pickled in Salt and Gall ! 
He comes amain , 
And drives his fiery Steeds , 
Like winged flames , 
To help them at their needs . 
CANT . VI 13.  

Return , return , OH Shulamite ; return , return , that we may look upon thee : what will ye see in the Shulamite ? as it were the company of two armies . 

HYMN 112.  

Return , return , OH Shulamite ; 
Return , return to me : 
Thy God would bring thee back again ; 
Messiah waits for thee . 
'T will be the Nations wonder , when 
The Power of this Command 
Shall knit thy Sinews , giving Life 
And Vigour to thy hand . 
This voice , Return , shall rouse thee up 
From dead sleep thou art under , 
And Spirit thy benumbed Limbs : 
't is like the voice of thunder . 
Wake , Judah , gird thy Harness on : 
Wake to the Battle now : 
Wake Israel , join thy forces with 
Thy sister Judah's bow . 
Two Armies , like two floods shall twist 
Their streams of fire together , 
And drink the sinful Nations up , 
And make their Glory wither . 
Proud Babel now shall tumble down , 
And all her Kings shall fall : 
Now Antichrist hath run her race : 
Shall be no more at all . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 124.  

Return , return , 
OH Shulamite , return , 
Return thou Daughter of fair Zion hill : 
OH , how I long ! 
My Soul is fainting till 
Thy God shall bring 
Thee back , and make thee burn 
With love to thy 
Messiah dear , and mourn . 
Return , return , 
And make the Nations wonder : 
Now shalt thou feel 
The Power of this command : 
I 'll give it force , 
thou shalt it not withstand : 
I 'll spirit that word 
With life , and make it thunder , 
And wake thee from 
That dead sleep thou art under . 
Wake Judah , wake , 
And gird thy Harness on : 
Wake Isra'l , wake , 
Wake to the Battle now : 
I 'll give the World 
To thee , thy armies too , 
Shall drink the sinful Nations up , and come 
And build their Trophies 
Zions mount upon . 
Now is the time , 
Ten shall a thousand chase : 
Proud Babel now 
Shall tumble down before ye ▪ 
I 'll make her stoop , 
And all her Kings adore ye . 
Now Antichrist , 
thou 'st run thy cursed race : 
Now Israel , 
Strike home , and take their place . 
CANT . VII . 1.  

How beautiful are thy feet with shoes , OH princes daughter ! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a cunning workman . 

HYMN 113.  

Come Princes Daughter , come , 
Born of the Royal Blood : 
My Father is thy Father , whom 
To serve 's thy chiefest good . 
I see thy feet are shod 
With preparation for 
A sweet returning to thy God , 
Whom once thou didst abhor . 
How welcome are thy goings ? 
How beautiful thy feet ? 
These buds that blossom from thy doings , 
To me are dearly sweet . 
there 's , not a step thou takest , 
Towards thy Messiah dear ; 
But drops a Jewel to enrich 
The World both far and near . 
Jewels are not so rich , 
As steps that Retrograde : 
't is enough to raise a pitch 
Of Love I never had . 
Pride not thyself for this ; 
Let me have all the praise , 
Who to thy steps did strength confer , 
And did this Building raise . 
Another to the Tune of Psal . 125.  

Come Daughter , born of Royal blood , 
The King of Heaven thy Father is ; 
He now awakes thee with a kiss : 
The day is come , so long withstood . 
thou art to him so dear , 
thou never needest fear . 
I see thy welcome feet are shod , 
With preparation from above : 
thou that didst hate , beginnest to Love , 
A sweet returning to thy God. 
How welcome are thy goings ? 
How welcome are thy doings ? 
The buds that blossom from thy feet ; 
The very Bones that turn and move ; 
In th' hollow of thy Thighs I love : 
All these to me are rarely sweet . 
Jewels are not so rare , 
Nor can with them compare . 
Pride not thyself , give God the Praise , 
That is the great Artificer , 
Did to thy steps this strength confer , 
And did this hopeful Building raise . 
To him thou owest thy birth , 
And more than thou art worth . 
CANT . VII . 2.  

Thy navel is like a round Goblet , which wanteth not liquor : thy belly is like an heap of wheat , set about with lilies . 

HYMN 114.  

Now I will tell the World the wonder : 
A barren Church grows fruitful ; she 
From whom in many hundred years , 
I had no Children born to me . 
Her Navel like a fountain filled , 
Held Goblets of infused Grace : 
Her pregnant Belly breeds a stock ; 
Like heaps of Wheat her number was . 
Nations are born at once ; they flock 
To her as Doves to Windows get . 
This is a Harvest to the Lord , 
Exceeding what he ere had yet . 
When thousands could Conversion date , 
From some one Sermons powerful word : 
This done in Zions infant-state , 
What will her manhood then afford ? 
Go Gentiles , go , your case condole , 
A thousand Sermons , scarce one Soul. 
Thy Teacher's fish , and nothing catch ; 
They knock , but who lists up the latch ?

Now I will tell the World a wonder , 
The barren Church grows fruitful : she 
From whom for many hundred years , 
I had no Children born to me : 
But now she fertile grows ; 
Her numbers no man knows . 
Nations are born at once : they flock 
To her , as Doves to windows get : 
Her Pregnant Belly bears a stock , 
For numbers like the grains of Wheat : 
And these like Lilies white , 
Are pure in my sight . 
This is a Harvest to the Lord ; 
Beyond itself in Infant-state , 
When thousands could conversion date ▪ 
From some one Sermons powerful word . 
Thomas since none such hath been ; 
I 'll make it so again : 
You Gentiles go , your case condole : 
A thousand Sermons , scarce a Soul ▪ 
Thy Teacher's fish , and nothing catch : 
They knock , but none lists up the Latch : 
I 'll fertile mercy's broach 
And take away Reproach . 
I will unite you unto those , 
Shall ' crease your numbers as their own : 
They shall like drops , where water flows , 
Or grains in heaps of Wheat become ; 
A Joyful day to Zion : 
A Pillow soft to lie on .

thine Eyes like Hesbons' Fish-pools stand 
Within Beth-rabbins gate ,

HYMN 126.  

THE Marriage being agreed upon , 
Between the Bridegroom and the Bride ▪ 
When will this blessed Jesus come , 
To tie the knot that must be tied ? 
wilt thou a public Wedding make ? 
Inviting all the World unto it ? 
no , no! retirement we 'll take ; 
But Angels , none shall see us do it . 
There are such persons , and such places , 
From the World's eye obscurely hid , 
And there will we exchange Embraces , 
There , there will we be Married .

Known to none else but thee and me :

For more than thousand pounds a year : 
I would not lose my stolen tears ,

am all alone in Meditation : 
Be sure my Christ is standing by , 
And most at large in Revelation .

As Children draw the Husband's love , 
Thus mine is drawn from me . 
Come see , and be the Bride 
Of this most glorious Groom , 
And lay your matters all aside , 
And to the Wedding come . 
You new converted are 
As much concerned as I : 
Flourish and dress yourselves , prepare ,

Take us , for we are thine , 
And are our own no longer :

As well as save , pray I

Begin to bless the World , and yield 
Their scents in every place . 
The Converts , both the new and old ,

To Seas from whence they spring :

When all his Saints shall woe him , 
And bring their Treasures , and shall pay

HYMN 129.  

Wert thou my brother , Lord , 
I could believe thy love : 
Or hadst thou sucked my Mother's Breasts , 
I could my fears remove : 
And think , 't were not below 
Thyself to make me thine : 
Alas ! thou art too far above 
This low estate of mine . 
thou art a glorious Prince , 
The Angels thee adore : 
And I the vilest worm that life's : 
This makes the wonder more . 
Will't thou be mean like me , 
And be with Flesh possessed , 
And fellow-man , and brother be , 
And suck thy Mother's Breast ? 
Well then ! I 'll kiss thee now ; 
no more thy distance dread ; 
Thus veiled in Flesh , I 'll dare approach ,

Wouldst thou but visit where I dwell ! 
I and my Mother would embrace thee , 
And Joy to see thee at our Cell . 
My Mother would instruct me where 
Her best and choicest Junkets lie : 
And I would entertain thee there , 
As blessed in thy sweet company . 
I 'd bring thee out my spiced Wine , 
Made of the Juice of Pomegranate , 
And thou shalt have this heart of mine , 
Inflamed with Love at highest rate . 
I will thee feast with all my best , 
And strive attendance due to give : 
thou shall have me , and all the rest , 
Thy own , so long as we shall live . 
I will end eavour , such a life 
Shall pleasing be to thy define , 
And speak thy Praise , till it shall raise 
Within my heart an holy fire . 
Only he pleased to come , and lend , 
Assisting Grace to this endeavour : 
If I by Ague-fits grow cold , 
Turn them into a burning Fever . 
CANT . VIII . 3.  

His left hand should be under my head , and his right hand should embrace me . 

HYMN 131.  

MY work is great : OH stay my head ; 
Infuse that Wisdom from above : 
And let thy strength my weakness wed , 
And with infirm'ty fall in Love. 
My head is sick , my heart is faint ; 
As overpow'rd with my task : 
I thee with all my Grief acquaint , 
And thy Assistance humbly ask . 
The left and right hand of thy Power ; 
Outward and inward help must give : 
Thy arms about me in this hour , 
Embrace me must , and make me live . 
OH , my Redeemer , with thy Arms 
Refresh the heart of fainting me . 
Let me experience thy Love-charms , 
Till I am more in love with thee . 
then shall my Charets run a pace ; 
no rubs shall hinder their swift motion : 
The Wheels anointed with thy Grace , 
As Ships ride fast upon the Ocean . 
Thus the warm hand on aching head , 
And circling Arms about the loins , 
Revives a man that lies half dead , 
And under difficulties pines .

I charge you , OH daughters of Jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love until he please . 

HYMN 132.  

MY King is gone to rest , 
And rests in his Love : 
Hath placed himself where he thought best , 
And never will remove . 
What pity than it is , 
For us to break his ease ; 
Or give the least disturbances , 
Or wake him till he please . 
He only knows his time ; 
He knows his time to rise : 
then he 'll awake and progress make 
To do his enterprise . 
Delays are dangerous 
To us , but not to him : 
He never stays , but his delays 
Have his Advances been . 
He cannot come too soon ; 
He never stayed too long : 
To his bedside your prayers may come , 
With other Saints along . 
With these you may awake him , 
When seeming fast asleep : 
But if you shall by Sin forsake him , 
OH , this will wound him deep . 
CANT . VIII . 5.  

Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved — 

HYMN 133.  

Upon the Wings of fame it fly's , 
To all the Nations round : 
That God hath oped Judah's eyes , 
And made his Grace abound . 
who 's this ! and what a thing is this , 
That Jew's of rude Behaviour ; 
Should at the last Messiah taste , 
And own him for their Saviour ? 
This news awakens all the Earth , 
Sounds like the Voice of Thunder : 
Never was such a Sight before , 
Never was such a Wonder . 
What Judah turn ! What Israel , 
That killed the Living Lord , 
And basely nailed him to the Cross ; 
The man which they abhorred ! 
What they return ! . and all at once ! 
They and their Children too ! 
And shall his imprecated Blood , 
A healing Virtue show ! 
OH blessed day ! Jehovah raise 
My heart to praise thee more : 
Let all the Lands now clap their hands , 
And Zions King adore . 
CANT . VIII ▪ 5.  

— I raised thee up under the Appletree : there thy Mother brought thee forth , there she brought thee forth that bore thee . 

HYMN 134.  

I saw thee in thy Father's Loins , 
And in thy Mother's Womb : 
When Eve , under the Appletree , 
Was working out thy Doom . 
I raised thee then , when thee I saw , 
Condemned by Adam's fall : 
Didst eat the Fruit , as well as he , 
The Father of us all . 
The Woman and her Seed was raised , 
By th' Woman and her Seed : 
Thus the same hand that gave the wound , 
Did help in time of need . 
I saw thee , when I died upon 
The cursed Tree , the Cross , 
All in thy Blood , as well as I , 
With all thy Sins in gross . 
I raised thee then ; my Blood cried , Live , 
To those that made me die : 
I built thee up a Tower of Love , 
Upon Mount Calvary . 
Keep humble then , OH Zion , and 
Think of thy Pedigree : 
Thomas I exalt thee thus , don't thou 
Exalt thyself , but me . 
CANT . VIII . 6.  

Set me as a seal upon thine heart , as a seal upon thine arm — 

HYMN 135.  

MY God since I am listed under 
So great a General as thee : 
Let me not fail to break in sunder , 
The Enemies' Force , what ere it be . 
Set me a Seal upon thy heart , 
As did the great Highpriest of old : 
On judgement 's Breastplate grave by art , 
The Names of Israel's Sons enrolled . 
OH let me lay my careful head , 
Upon that Pillow of thy Love : 
And feel myself so kindly led , 
Into thy very heart , my Dove . 
Set me a Seal upon thy Arm ; 
Upon thy mighty Shoulders bear me ; 
And guide me thorough , that no harm , 
Or Cowardice may ever fear me . 
Let it be now , as when of old , 
I on thy Palms engraven was : 
When thou didst all my walls uphold ; 
Again Lord , let it come to pass . 
then will I open the Silent doors , 
And make all Creatures give thee praise : 
The slumbering Earth , the Seas that roars , 
Shall each contend thy Name to raise . 
CANT . VIII . 6.  

— For Love is as strong as death , jealousy is as cruel as the grave — 

HYMN 136.  

Boast of thy Triumphs , Death ! 
OH Time advance thy Wings ! 
Love hath as many kill Darts 
As thou hast deadly Stings . 
When Christ shall Arm his Love , 
And gird his Bowels on : 
His Enemies shall before him fall , 
And Death itself undone . 
Observe the World , and see 
What conquests Death hath made : 
How many Kings ▪ and such like things , 
In silent graves hath laid . 
Such Conquests in his Strength , 
King Jesus will obtain : 
His Jealousy will rage at length , 
And he alone shall reign . 
no strength shall stand before him , 
no Ammunition Force . 
he 'll Slay the Kings that wont adore him , 
And Love shall have its course . 
then shall we be at rest , 
And Peace on every side : 
Victorious Love will have it so , 
When he asserts his Bride . 
CANT . VIII . 6.  

— The coals thereof are coals of fire , which hath a most vehement flame . 

HYMN 137.  

Have you not seen the Desolations 
That veh'ment Flames have made ; 
What multitudes of Habitations , 
In dust and rubbish laid ? 
How fiercely without all respect , 
To things or persons had , 
It quickly works its sad effect , 
And makes men's cases bad ? 
Thus will the just revenging God , 
Before him send a Fire ; 
And with a smarting burning Rod , 
Our blood on them require . 
Now Fire for Fire , Blood for Blood , 
City for City , shall 
Be fired down ; he 'll quench his Wrath 
In Blood , and make them fall . 
Now Babel's Towers all shall fall , 
And all her Props come down : 
The bitter Cup she must drink up , 
And off must come her Crown . 
My God make haste , why stay thy Wheels ! 
Why stay thy Charets , Lord ! 
OH , why so long , before thou come , 
According to thy word ? 
CANT . VIII . 7.  

Many waters cannot quench Love , neither can the floods drown it — 

HYMN 138.  

Waters' that quench the fire , can't 
Put out the Fire of Love : 
Immortal Love nor drowns , nor dies ; 
It's life is from above . 
His Love to his , will make its way , 
To rid us out of thrall : 
there 's none shall stand at that great day , 
That don't before him fall . 
Be wise ye Princes of the Earth , 
And kiss the Son of God : 
His Anger fumes , who 's he presumes 
To urge his Iron-rod ? 
His Love shall bring a flood of Fire , 
Like Noah's Water-flood : 
Topping the Mountains in his Ire , 
That cannot be withstood . 
My Soul admires the Power of Love : 
love 's all , for Gods is Love : 
His Foes , as soon may quench the Sun , 
As this vast Love remove . 
If one small spark of Love in us , 
Can live in Waters deep : 
Much more his glorified Love , 
Alive in Seas will keep . 
CANT . VIII . 7.  

— If a man would give all the substance of his house for love , it would utterly be condemned . 

HYMN 139.  

What is the price of Love , my King ? 
What shall I give thee for a spark ? 
Will all my substance buy the thing ? 
Away fond Worm ! thou 'rt in the dark . 
Love never yet was bought or sold ; 
Come all ye hungry thirsty Souls ; 
The price of Love is yet untold : 
Come without money , fill your bowls . 
▪ 't is a mistake , to think that Christ , 
Did ever purchase Fathers Love : 
'T was Love , by which he did subsist ; 
'T was Love that brought him from above . 
Thomas ' amongst the Sons of men , their Love 
Is bought and sold for worldly pelf : 
Yet never did thy God above 
Erect a Market for himself . 
His love is free : come Souls , and see 
How undeserved his kindness is , 
While Sinners , while ungodly , we 
Are called to take this Love of his . 
Nor can the Sinner at his need ; 
Purchase this Love with all his Gold : 
Free Love , free Grace , is all we read : 
Christ's Love is neither bought nor sold . 
CANT . VIII . 8.  

We have a little sister , and she hath no breasts : what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for ? 

HYMN 140.  

WE have a little Sister , Lord , 
That hath no Breasts , as yet ; 
There is no place for means of Grace : 
OH do not her forget . 
Thy Servants are greatly athirst 
That joyful day to see : 
When thou the Cords and Yokes shall burst ▪ 
From her as well as we . 
What shall we do for those that lie 
In Nature's dungeon still ▪ 
When wilt thou speak for them that die 
For want of Zions Hill ! 
Those that have neither Milk nor Breasts , 
That still lie weltering in 
The Blood of uncoverted State : 
OH call them out of Sin. 
Our Sister hath a precious Soul 
To save , as well as we . 
Would all the World were thine , and not 
A Rebel we could see . 
OH say thou to our Sister , Come , 
Leave Babel to her flames : 
Let her not perish in the doom 
Of Babel's wretched names . 
CANT . VIII . 9  

If she be a wall , we will build upon her a palace of silver : and if she be a door , we will enclose her with boards of Cedar . 

HYMN 141.  

How welcome were that blessed news , 
To the whole Nation of the Jews , 
When Elect Sisters shall return ? 
When newborn hope , and panting strength , 
Thomas but a little , comes at length , 
And hard and soft together mourn ? 
we 'll blow the blossoms : not a spark 
Or glance that twinkles in the dark , 
But shall be raised into a flame . 
Of every Wall , we 'll make a Tower , 
Of every twig we 'll make a Bower , 
And turn a drop into a rain . 
A silver Palace we will make her , 
In the day we undertake her ; 
With Cedar-boards we will enclose her , 
And all the riches Love can find 
In her vast Stores , shall be resigned , 
To make her happy in the closure . 
Lord something give to work upon 
( Creation is thy work alone ) 
And gladly we 'll to them repair 
That lie in darkness ; great and small , 
With Death's black shadow covered all , 
And make them teem that barren were . 
Come then , you Nations , all you Kings , 
And Nobles , flock to Zions wings ; 
there 's healing for your wounded hearts . 
And let the Wealth of Zions King , 
And so your own advantage , bring 
Your Souls to him from Satan's darts . 
CANT . VIII . 10.  

I am a wall — 

HYMN 142.  

I Was a heap of Dust 
And Rubbish , quite forsaken : 
Disparkt and into Forest turned , 
no care of me was taken . 
Help me to bless the Lord ; 
ye Idol-nations come : 
Let 's Praise the Lord with joint accord , 
And bless his Name alone . 
I found his favour when 
My case was worse than yours : 
I was a prize in his fair eyes , 
Such help free Grace procures . 
And now I am a Wall ; 
Whose strength shall ever stand : 
The matter of it is Freestone ; 
Laid by Free-grace's hand . 
The Cement is the Blood 
Was shed upon the Cross : 
The height of it o'retops the Skies . 
Will you this Love engross ? 
Thomas you have cruel been , 
Both to the Saints and me : 
Yet if this call shall fetch you in , 
I 'll be a Wall , you see . 
CANT . VIII . 10.  

— And my Breasts are Towers — 

HYMN 143.  

ALL Praises bring to Zions King : 
See what I was , and what I am : 
My hills of Flesh could not refresh 
The thirst of one poor sucking Lamb. 
Children I had , but ill brought up ; 
no Sustenance within their powers : 
They always drank of Moses Cup ; 
But now through Grace , my Breasts are Tow'rs . 
And thus ye Gentiles , 't was with you , 
When almost all your pipes were cut : 
Your Teachers into Corners drew , 
Your Pastors into Prisons put . 
Your Breasts were cut , that should have given 
Their Milk to them the Beasts devours : 
But thanks be to the God of Heaven , 
That now through Grace ▪ your Breasts are Tow'rs . 
Let Lambs of Christ now friskings and dance , 
And sport themselves on Zion hill : 
For God will now their heads advance ; 
Their Mother's Breasts with fatness fill . 
And though our milky Breasts have been , 
Like Fountains stopped by higher Powers . 
( It was our Glory , but their Sin ) ; 
But now through Grace , our Breasts are Tow'rs . 
CANT . VIII . 10.  

— then was I in his eyes as one that found favour . 

HYMN 144.  

Now doth my thankful heart rebound , 
And fain would raise me higher , 
To bless the favour that I found . 
OH draw me to thee nigher . 
Help me to strip me of myself ; 
Into some Cherub turn : 
To sound the Praise of thee , my King : 
OH make the Fire burn , 
And heat my Heart redhot with Love : 
Such favour I have found . 
Would I were nothing else but Love , 
Thy Praises to resound . 
How happy are the Souls in Bliss , 
The Spirits perfect made ; 
Whose everlasting work it is , 
To love thee , is their trade ! 
Who have no body of their own , 
no body else to hinder ▪ 
OH that I could but praise thee here , 
As they can Praise thee yonder . 
The favour of thy Heart and Eyes 
So unexpected was ▪ 
't is Love of all things that I prise ; 
So great a worth it hath . 
CANT . VIII . 11.  

Solomon had a Vineyard at Baal-hamon : he let out the Vineyard unto Keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof , was to bring a thousand pieces of silver . 

HYMN 145.  

ZION , my Vineyard , is become 
As desolate as once she was : 
And there are Nations in her Womb , 
Like Pregnant Vines that all surpass . 
I 'll Water her both Night and Day , 
And sweetly force her coming Fruit : 
Let the Winds bluster as they may . 
I GOD , have said it , and I 'll do it . 
King Solomon had a Vineyard great , 
In Baal-hamon it was placed : 
It was a sweet and lovely Seat ; 
Greatly admired and embraced . 
'T was fet with Vines and other Trees , 
And richly stored in every place : 
But not like mine : my Plants are Souls , 
And Stocks of an immortal race . 
He farm d his Vineyard out to those , 
A thousand Silverlings that gave : 
But of the Vineyard I have chose , 
Myself alone the dressing have . 
I made my Plants , so did not he ; 
I set them all with my own hand . 
Those that were dead , restored be , 
And flourish all at my command . 
CANT . VIII . 12.  

My Vineyard which is mine , is before me : thou , OH Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof , two hundred . 

HYMN 146.  

King Solomon's Tenants shared the Fruit ; 
They profit had , as well as he , 
Or else they never had come to 't : 
Two hundred silverlings their Fee. 
My Saints , I must have all your Fruit ; 
Your Pains and Labours all is mine : 
Your Glory bring to Zions King ; 
't is he that waters every Vine . 
Now shall you bear your Fruit to me , 
That once the stranger had devoured : 
Now shall you be like fruitful trees , 
And Apples in my bosom poured . 
Now shall your Fruit be pleasant , and 
Full grown and Mellow for my taste . 
Instead of rent to me in hand , 
I 'll pay you all the Rent at last . 
You serve yourselves in serving me ; 
You love yourselves when me you love : 
If here you not rewarded be ; 
You shall received in Heaven above . 
And though King Solomon could not graft 
Into himself to raise his Fruit : 
You into me shall grafted be : 
Take it upon my word , I 'll do 't . 
CANT . VIII . 13.  

thou that dwellest in the Gardens , the companions harken to thy voice — 

HYMN 147.  

MY work is done , I must be gone ; 
My business calls away , 
To wait upon my Father's Throne : 
Farewell , I must not stay . 
Mean while , I 'll leave my heart behind , 
And often to thee send : 
And spread thy case , at Throne of Grace , 
And strongly thee defend . 
i  placed thy Habitation in 
The Gardens of delight . 
no more the Boar , as was before , 
Thy tender Plants shall bite . 
Amid these fruitful Plants shall be 
Thy work and dwelling placed : 
And with encouragement thou shalt see 
Each Border sweetly graced . 
In these enclosed Gardens , let 
The Commons hear thy voice , 
And those that have not listened yet , 
To hear thee , shall rejoice . 
then tell them plainly all the thing : 
Bid them accept their bliss : 
When news you bring of Zions King , 
They will be yours and his . 
CANT . VIII . 13.  

— cause me to hear it . 

HYMN 148.  

OH Let me hear you Preach to those 
That would Companions be 
In Sufferings and in Privilege : 
OH bring them unto me . 
Call nothing common and unclean : 
The greatest Sinner may 
By precious blood be turned to good ; 
Their sins be done away : 
But let me hear you speak to me . 
no whispering Trumpet shall 
Convey the Voice : my Spirit shall be 
Your Mouth , your Post , your All. 
I must be gone , you know a while , 
As was ordained of old : 
To get things ready for the day 
That was so long foretold . 
But in this distance let me hear 
From thee , my dearest Love. 
Acquaint me but with what thou want'st , 
I 'll send it from above . 
My full supplies shall feast thine Eyes , 
And make thy heart rejoice : 
I only move to thee my love , 
Let me but hear thy Voice . 
CANT . VIII 14.  

Make haste , my beloved , and be thou like to a roe , or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices . 

HYMN 149.  

MY God , make all the hast thou canst ; 
Why do the hours move so slow ? 
Why stops the glass that turned was 
So many hundred years ago ? 
Is wakeful time fallen fast asleep ? 
Why do the wheels of Motion stay ? 
Why doth my God in Prison keep 
That blessed and longed-for glorious day . 
Lover's will hasten all they can : 
thou lovest ; then , why dost thou stay ? 
What Love and linger ? OH make haste : 
Lord if thou lov'st me , come away . 
't is not the pleasures of the World ; 
Nor joys , nor toys , that can delight me . 
The blessed Angels lovely Faces , 
Without thy Presence would affright me . 
The glorious Joys of Heaven itself , 
Are but a Map of thee , my King : 
Jesus in Shorthand Characters : 
A notion , but thyself the thing . 
Come then , my All , my chiefest good ; 
When shall blessed Heavens so befriend us , 
To spare thee down ? OH when shall they 
A sight of our dear JESUS send us . 
Is it not midnight , Lord , and past ! 
When shall we hear the Clocks strike One ? 
One Faith , One Way , One Sight , One Taste , 
One Lawgiver , One Lord , One Throne ? 
One Truth , One Gospel , One Consent , 
One God , One Jesus only known ? 
O that this midnight-hour were spent , 
That all might coalesce in One.  
CANT . VIII . 14.  

— Be thou like to a roe , or to a young hart upon a the mountains of spices . 

HYMN 150.  

Never more need to come with speed ▪ 
Foundations are dissolved : 
Justice and Right is fallen quite : 
Thy Saints in woe involved . 
Lord , if thou wilt by water come ▪ 
Mine Eyes shall weep a Sea : 
Or if by Land ! my Charets stand 
In readiness for thee . 
Pardon this error ; tears nor love , 
Nor no such thing from me , 
Can speed his coming from above , 
But Love that is in thee . 
The spicy Mountains are thy way ; 
Thy steps perfume the Air : 
The Heavens' shall open in that day , 
And Beams of glory fair . 
The Angels shall attend thy call , 
Thy Saints shall wait upon thee , 
Thy Dead shall rise , thy Trump surprise 
Thy Enemies flying from thee . 
OH that , that welcome day were come ! 
We never saw a day . 
Can it be day without a Sun ? 
Sweet Jesus ! come away . 
Triuni Gloria . Omnia fecit Amor.  

FINIS .
