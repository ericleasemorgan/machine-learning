The Slighted Maid . OR , The Pining Lover . 

With sighs and moans she doth entreat her Dear , 
whilst he seems to be deaf and will not hear ; 
At length his frozen heart begins to melt , 
being moved with the passion she had felt . 
To the Tune of , I prithee Love turn to me . 





Was ever Maiden so scorned , 
by one that she loved so dear : 
Long time I have sighed and mourned , 
and still my love will not hear . 
OH turn to me my own dear heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me ; 
For thou art the Lad I long for 
and alas what remedy . 
My Lodging it is on the could ground , 
and very hard is my fare : 
But that Which trouble's me most , is 
the unkindness of my Dear . 
OH turn to me my own Sweetheart , 
and I prithee Love-turn to me ; 
For thou art the man I long for , 
and alas what remedy . 
OH stop not thy ears to the wail , 
of me a poor harmless Maid . 
You know we are subject to failing , 
blind Cupid hath me betrayed . 
And now I must cry OH turn Love. 
and I prithee Love turn to me . 
For thou art the man that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
Now canst thou be so hard hearted , 
and cruel to me alone . 
If ever we should be parted , 
than all my delight is gone . 
But ever I cry OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me 
For thou art the man that alone art 
the cause of my misery . 
The second part , 

to the same tune . 





I 'll make thee pretty sweet posies , 
and constant I ever will prove , 
I 'll strew thy chamber with roses , 
and all to delight my Love.  
then turn to me my own dear heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
I 'll do my endeavour to please thee , 
by making thy bed full soft . 
Of all thy sorrows I 'll ease thee , 
by kissing thy lips full oft . 
then turn to me my own dear heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man that alone can 
procure my liberry . 
But thou wilt harden thy heart still , 
and be deaf to my pitiful moan : 
So I must endure the smart still , 
and tumble in straw all alone . 
Whilst still I cry OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man that alone art 
the cause of my misery . 
If that thou still do disdain me , 
I never will love the more . 
Thy cruelty shall never pain me , 
for I 'll have another in store . 
But still I cry OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man that alone art 
the cause of my misery . 
By hearing her pitiful clamour , 
the passion of Love he felt , 
He could no longer disdain her , 
his frozen heart it did melt ; 
For ever she cried OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man , that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
He said my Love I will please thee 
thy heaviness grieves me sore , 
But let not sorrow once seize thee , 
I never will grieve thee more . 
I 'll turn to thee my own kind heart , 
dear Love I 'll turn to thee . 
For I am the man that now art come 
to procure thy liberty . 
I 'll crown thee with garlands of straw then 
and marry thee with a rush ring , 
My frozen heart it will thaw then , 
and merrily we will sing , 
But ever she cried OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the man , that alone can 
release my misery . 
Most lovingly he embraced her 
and called her his heart's delight , 
And close by his side he plac ; t her , 
all sorrow was vanished quite , 
And now she for joy cried , turn Love 
and I prithee Love turn to me 
For thou art the man , that alone hast 
released me of misery . 
FINIS .
