Two unfortunate Lovers , or , a true Relation of the lamentable end of john True , and Susan Mess : 

Their lives this Ditty doth relate , And how they died unfortunate . To the tune of , The Bride's Burial . 

Attend you lovers and give ear , 
unto my mournful song , 
Of two that loved faithfully , 
yet each did other wrong . 
At Coventy in Warwickshire , 
this youngman he did dwell , 
His name john True a Shoemaker , 
and lived of it full well . 
At Corley did this Maiden dwell , 
three miles from Coventry : 
Yet for the love he bore to her , 
oft times he would her see . 
And coming unto her one day , 
he told to her his mind : 
Susan , quoth he , I love thee dear , 
be not to me unkind . 
If thou canst love and fancy me , 
in heart and eke in mind : 
I will prove loving unto thee , 
and never be unkind . 
Thy cheerful looks rejoice my heart , 
and merry make my mind : 
Sweet Susan then love me again , 
be not to me unkind . 
Good john I thank you for your love , 
and wish yede home to tarry , 
I am too young for you to wed , 
and have no mind to marry . 
Where you do dwell are Maids good store , 
of beauty fair and free , 
Set not your love upon me then , 
for I cannot love thee . 
This answer struck him to the heart 
as cold as any stone : 
then homewards strait he did repair , 
with many a sigh and groan . 
Wishing that he had ne'er been born , 
or in his cradle died , 
Unhappy man to love so true , 
and yet to be denied . 
Quoth he , I will to her again , 
and hear what she doth say , 
It may be she may be more kind , 
though first she said me nay . 
then coming to the town again , 
he sent for her strait way , 
Desiring her to speak with him , 
but she did it denay . 
then did he sigh , lament and grieve , 
and knew not what to say , 
then did he take his pen in hand . 
and written these words strait way ; 
My heart's delight and only joy , 
kill not me with disdain , 
Vouchsafe that I may speak with thee 
and rid me of my pain . 
Resolve me sweetest I thee pray , 
why is thy hatred such ? 
I know no cause , unless it be 
for loving thee to much . 
As is my name so is my love , 
sweet Susan unto thee : 
True is my name , true is my love , 
and ever so shall be . 
My love is loyal just and good , 
kill me not with disdain , 
Rather do me that courtesy , 
to love for love again . 
When she had read and understood , 
his mind and his intent , 
She then began to like and love , 
and yield him hearts content , 
john I am thine , if thou be'st mine , 
for ever and for ay , 
It was to prove thy constancy , 
that I did say thee nay . 
But here 's my hand , my heart & love 
I 'll ne'er thee more deny , 
My love is constant firm and true , 
and shall be till I die . 
then they embraced each others love , 
and joyed in heart and voice , 
That he of her , and she of him , 
had made so sweet a choice . 
But fortune which doth often frown 
where she before did smile , 
The man's delight and maiden's joy , 
full soon she did beguile . 
The second Part , to the same tune . 

When she was settled in her love , 
than he would change his mind , 
And for to try her constancy , 
would be to her unkind . 
And thus resolved in his mind , 
he 'd come to her no more , 
But went and wood another maid , 
which grieved her heart full sore . 
( Quoth he ) she proved unto me , 
hardhearted and unkind , 
But now her true love I have won , 
I 'll bear the self same mind . 
When she perceived his love to her , 
not as 't was wont to be , 
She did lament , sigh , weep and grieve 
and then these words spoke she . 
Falsehearted man adieu , quoth she , 
disloyal and unkind , 
And if I die for love of thee , 
thou shalt not know my mind . 
Woe to the time I did believe , 
that flattering look of thine , 
Would God that I had never seen , 
the tears of thy false eyes . 
Hard hap had I to set my love , 
on one that mocked me , 
Sure all the country doth not yield , 
a man so false as he . 
Thus was she brought to weak estate 
all comforts from her fled , 
She did desire to speak with him . 
before that she was dead . 
Her friends did seek to cheer her heart 
and to make glad her mind , 
But she was killed with loving him , 
that proved to her unkind . 
Falsehearted man , may never maid 
love thee as I have done , 
But may my death remembered be , 
to time that is to come . 
And may all maid's example take , 
by this my mournful death , 
And now sweet Lord receive my soul 
to thee I yield my breath . 
Thus died the pattern of true love , 
thus died a virtuous maid , 
Thus died as good a harmless Lass 
as ever Love betrayed . 
Sir maids in white as custom is , 
did bring her to the grave , 
Her parents grieve , lament & mourn , 
no child at all they have . 
When as her Lover understood , 
for truth that she was dead , 
He raged , and ready was to tear 
his hair from off his head . 
But when he came into the town , 
whereas his true Love lay , 
He straightway ran unto her grave , 
and these words there did say . 
Susan ( quoth he ) I 'll kiss thy grave , 
upon my bent knee , 
Whereby I 'll show to all the world , 
how dear I loved thee . 
And as he lay upon the grave , 
he heard a voice to say , 
john True if ere thou lov'dst me dear , 
make haste and come away . 
then started he up from the grave , 
and stood like one struck dumb , 
But when he had regained his speech , 
he cried , I come , I come . 
And thus like one out of his wits , 
he raged in piteous sort , 
That all the neighbours presently , 
were grieved at this report . 
And thus with sorrow & grief of heart , 
he lay a whole fortnight : 
But when he had confessed his fault , 
he yielded up his spirit . 
According to his hearts desire , 
and as he did request , 
They digged his grave , & laid him down 
by her whom he loved best . 
You young men all that have true loves 
prove true unto your friend , 
And if you love , be sure your love 
be true unto the end . 
And thus I end my story true , 
so full of grief and woe . 
May never any seek again , 
to wrong each other so . 
FINIS .
