To the right honourable his singular good Lord and Master Sir Edward Seymoore . Knight , Baron Beacham , Earl of Hartfoord , and Lieutenant of his Majesty's Counties of Somerset and Wiltes . 

IT is a question hardly to be determined ( my most honourable Lord ) whether Music may esteem herself more graced by the singularskil & exquisite knowledge wherewith your Lordship is endued , both in the speculation and practise thereof : or by the many benefits , and infinite favours your Honourable bounty hath conferred on the professors of that faculty : in both are the muses greatly honoured , and we ( their servants ) highly blessed ; whose virtuous endeavours and studious labours , not in this only , but in many other kinds of Learning , have received their life ; growth , and perfection , chereshed and enabled by the warmth your beams have cast upon them . amongst many , that on the Muse's behalf do own your Lordship the tribute of their pens , I must profess myself to stand deepliest engaged in the debt of duty , in that the poornes of my merit holds least proportion with the largeness of your grace , and that my utmost desert can reach no further , then humbly to acknowledge , that what delight or sweetness soever these my simple travels may bring to such generous and well composed spiritsas bear affection to this quality , was inspired meby no other power then the influence of your favour . And though the error of conceit cannot make me so far overvalew them , as to esteem them worthy your Lordship's judicious hearing , yet I will confess their want of worth ( wherewith myself as an impartial censurer , have already justly taxte them ) could not divert my purpose from publishing to the world the zeal I bear to thankfulness : wherein I am ambitious of nothing but your Lordships favourable acceptance and protection , which if it may please you to vouchsafe to this first birth of my Muse. I shall then be as far from fearing detraction and censure , as I am free from affecting glory and praise . 

Your Lordship's most humble devoted servant , John Bartlet

His blinking eyes will ever be awake , 
His idle head is sul of laughing toys , 
His bow and shafts are tickle things to take , 
It is no meddling with such apish boys , 
For they shall find that in his fetters fall , 
Love is a deadly thing to deal withal . 
Yet where the wretch doth take a happy vain , 
It is the kindest worm that ever was , 
But let him catch a coy conceit again , 
In frantic fits , he doth a fury pass , 
So that in sum who hopes of happy joy , 
Take heed of love , it is a perilous boy .

Hoping at length she 'll hear my doleful cries .

For Cupid to have aimed at with his shafts , 
then had not these my pations bolted out , 
Blazing my follies unto wise men's hates .

But why wish I to Cupid so much good , 
When he hath broke his shafts and silver bow , 
And finds a flame enkindled in my blood , 
Which neither I 'll can quench nor mountain snow 
And sure no marvel if he conquer men , 
when gods so fair a saint ; have never seen .

Her ruby lips her perled teeth in number ,
