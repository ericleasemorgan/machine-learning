The Slighted MAID : OR , The Pining Lover : 

With sighs and moans she doth entreat her Dear , 
Whilst he seems to be deaf and will not hear : 
At length his frozen Heart begins to melt , 
Being moved with the passon she had felt . 
To the Tune of , I prithee Love turn me , etc.  

Licenced and Entered according to Order . 





Was ever Maiden so scorned , 
by one that she loved so dear ; 
Long time have I sighed and mourned , 
and still my Love will not hear : 
OH turn to me my own dear Heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me ; 
For thou act the Lad I long for , 
and , alas ! what remedy ? 
My lodging is on the cold ground , 
and very hard is my fare , 
But that which trouble's me most , is 
the unkindness of my Dear : 
OH turn to me my own dear Heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me ; 
For thou art the Lad I long for , 
and 〈…〉 
OH stop not thy ear to the wail 
of me a poor harmless Maid ; 
You know we are subject to failing , 
blind Cupid hath me betrayed : 
And now I must cry , OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone art 
the cause of my misrey . 
How canst thou be so heard hearted , 
and cruel to me alone ; 
If ever we should be parted , 
than all my delight is gone ; 
But ever I cry , OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone art 
the cause of my misery . 
I 'll make thee pretty sweet posies , 
and constant I ever will prove , 
I 'll strew thy chamber with roses 
and all to delight my Love : 
then turn to me my own dear Heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
I 'll do my endeavour to please thee , 
by making the bed full soft , 
Of all thy sorrows I 'll ease thee , 
by kissing thy lips full oft : 
then turn to me my own dear Heart , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
But t●●u wilt harden thy heart still 






If that thou still do dis●●in me , 
I never will love thee more , 
Thy cruelty shall never pain me , 
for I 'll have another in store : 
But still I cry , OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone art 
the cause of my misery . 
By hearing her pitiful clamour , 
the passion of love he felt ; 
He could no longer disdain her , 
his frozen heart it did melt : 
For ever the cried , OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art the Man that alone can 
procure my liberty . 
He said , My Love I will please thee , 
thy heaviness grieves me sore , 
But let not sorrow once seize thee , 
I never will grieve thee more : 
I 'll turn to thee my own kind Heart , 
dear Love I 'll turn to thee ; 
For I am Man that now am come 
to procure thy liberty . 
I 'll crown thee with a garland of straw then , 
and marry thee with a rush-ring , 
My frozen heart it will thaw then , 
and merrily we will sing : 
But ever she cried , OH turn Love , 
and I prithee Love turn to me , 
For thou art Man that alone can 
release my misery .
