Phillis forsaken , In Pursuit of CORIDON . 

Behold fair Phillis by her Love forsaken 
In search of him that will not be o'er taken , 
Whilst she ( poor soul ) her cheeks with tears bedewing , 
Rome's over hills and dales in vain pursuing . 
'T would melt a marble heart , her sad complaining 
Whilst he seems deaf , her Love and she disdaining . 
To the Tune of , Daphnaes' Complaint , or OH my Love , etc.  





AS I went abroad to play 
In a morning fresh and gay , 
Hearing the sweet Nightingale 
Tell her sad and doleful tale . 
Straight I heard a voice to cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
pity me or else I die . 
At the first I was amazed 
And with greedy eyes I gazed , 
Till at length I saw where stood 
Phillis in a pensive mood , 
Mournfully she thus did cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die , 
Turn OH turn sweet Coridon 
Do not thus thy Phillis wrong , 
Harken to my woeful plaint , 
Now with sorrow I am faint , 
Whilst I strain my voice to cry . 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
Tell me dearest tell me plain 
Why thou dost my Love disdain , 
Wherein have I done a miss 
That I am debarred of bliss . 
Listen to my woeful cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly 
Pity me or else I die , 


OH Hard hearten Shepherd turn 
Let not Phillis longer mourn , 
See her tender body 's torn 
With the bramble and the thorn , 
Harken to my mournful Song , 
OH my Love , OH my Love. 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
Why art thou more cruel far 
Than the Tiger and the Bear , 
Do not bear so fierce a mind 
As the wild beasts in their kind , 
Harken to my doleful cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
Each green fields and shady Grove 
Bear you witness of my love , 
And the little Lambs which play 
In the flowery field so gay , 
Hear me whilst with grief I cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
All you pretty birds that sings 
And you Crystal streaming springs 
That do murmur as you glide 
By the pleasant Meadows side , 
Bear a part when I do cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
Pan thou god of Shepherd Swains 
Viewing these Arcadian plains , 
Cast an eye upon my grief 
Coridon hath played the thief . 
Pity me when I do cry 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Turn again or else I die . 
Venus with thy naked boy 
After sorrow send me joy , 
Stop my Lover in his Race 
And bring him to me face to face , 
That he once may hear me c‚óèy , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why didst thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
You fair Nymphs that sport and play 
And Diana's laws obey , 
Did you not meet my Coridon 
Tell me which way he is gone , 
That I once may cease to cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why dost thou fly , 
Pity me or else I die . 
Thus fair Phillis did complain 
On the pleasant flowery plain , 
Till at last her Lover came 
For to ease her of her pain . 
then she thus began to cry , 
OH my Love , OH my Love , 
OH my Love why didst thou fly , 
Ease me of my misery .
