TO THE HONOURABLE AND VIRTUOUS GENTLEMAN SIR ROBERT SIDNEY , KNIGHT GOVERNOR UNDER HER MAJESTY OF THE TOWN OF VLUSHING , AND THE CASTLE OF THE Ramekins IN THE LOW COUNTRIES , AND OF the forts of the same appendent , with the garrison therein placed as well of horse as foot . 

YOUR great love and favour Honourable Sir , ever manifested to all worthy Sciences , hath emboldened me to offer up at your Lordship's Shrine , these the unworthy labours of my musical travels . And though in respect of their weakness , they may perhaps seem untimely brought forth , and therefore the unlikelier to prospero ; yet doubt I not but if tendered by you , they shall happily find gentle cherishing , which may be a mean to make them more stronger , or else miscarrying , to encourage my endeavours to beget a better : for as no arts winks at fewer errors than music : so none greater enemies to their own profession than musicians ; who whilst in their own singularity , they condemn every man's works , as some way faulty , they are the cause , the art is the less esteemed , and they themselves reputed as selfe-commenders , and men most fantastical . wherefore if this one censuring infirmity were removed , these my airs ( free I dare say from gross errors ) would find every where more gracious entertainment . But since even those , who are best seen in this art , cannot vaunt themselves free from such detractours , I the less regard it being so well accompanied . Howsoever if herein I may gain your Honour's good allowance , I shall think I have attained to the better end of my labours ( which with myself , and the best of my service ) rests ever more at your Lordship's employment . 

Your Lordship's devoted in all dutiful service . ROBERT JONES . 

TO THE READER 

GENTLEMEN , since my desire is your ears should be my indifferent judges , I cannot think it necessary to make my travels , or my bringing up arguments to persuade you that I have a good opinion of myself , only thus much will I say : That I may prevent the rash judgments of such as know me not . Ever since I practised speaking , I have practised singing ; having had no other quality to hinder me from the perfect knowledge of this faculty , I have been encouraged by the warrant of diverse good judgments , that my pains herein shall at the least procure good liking , if not delight , which yet for mine own part I must needs fear as much as I desire , especially when I consider the ripeness of this industrious age , wherein all men endeavour to know all things , I confess I was not unwilling to embrace the conceits of such gentlemen as were earnest to have me apparel these ditties for them ; which though they intended for their private recreation , never meaning they should come into the light , were yet content upon entreaty to make the encouragements of this my first adventure , whereupon I was almost glad to make my small skill known to the world : presuming that if my cunning failed me in the Music : yet the words might speak for themselves , howsoever it pleaseth them to accounted better of that , then of those . Of purpose ( as it should seem ) to make me believe I can do something ; my only hope is , that seeing neither my cold airs , not their idle ditties ( as they will needs have me call them ) have hitherto been sounded in the ears of many : they may chance to find such entertainment , as commonly news doth in the world : which if I may be so happy to bear , I will not say my next shall be better , but I will promise to take more pains to show more points of music , which now I could not do , because my chiefest care was to fit the Note to the Word , till when , I must be as well content with each man's lawful censure , as I shall be glad of some men's undeserued favours .

CANTUS 

A Woman's looks are barbed hooks , that catch by art the strongest hart , when yet they spend no breath , but let them speak & sighing break , forth into tears , their words are spears , that wound our souls to death . 

2 

The rarest wit 
Is made forget , 
And like a child 
Is oft beguiled , 
With love's sweet seeming bait : 
Love with his rod 
So like a God , 
commands the mind 
We cannot find , 
Fair shows hide fowl deceit . 
3 

Time that all things 
In order brings , 
Hath taught me now 
To be more slow , 
In giving faith to speech : 
Since woman's words 
no truth affords , 
And when they kiss 
They think by this , 
Us men to overreach . 
ALTUS .

CANTUS 

Fond wanton youths , fond wanton youths make love a God , which after proveth ages rod , their youth , their time , their wit , their art , they spend in seeking of their smart , and which of follies is the chief , they woo their woe , they woo their woe , they wed their grief . 

2 

All find it so who wedded are , 
loves sweets they find enfold sour care : 
His pleasures pleasingst in the eye , 
Which tasted once , with loathing die : 
They find of follies 't is the chief , 
Their woe to woo to wed their grief . 
3 

If for their own content they choose , 
Forthwith their kindred's love they lose : 
And if their kindred they content , 
For ever after they repent . 
OH 't is of all our follies chief , 
Our woe to woo to wed our grief . 
4 

In bed what strifes are bred by day , 
Our puling wives do open lay : 
None friends none foes we must esteem , 
But whom they so vouchsafe to deem : 
OH 't is of all our follies chief , 
Our woe to woo to wed our grief . 
5 

Their smiles we want if ought they want , 
And either we their wills must grant , 
Or die they will or are with child , 
Their laughing must not be beguiled : 
OH 't is of all our follies chief , 
Our woe to woe to wed our grief , 
6 

Fowl wives are jealous , fair wives false , 
Marriage to either binds us thrall : 
wherefore being bound we must obey , 
And forced be perforce to say ▪ 
Of all our bliss it is the chief , 
Our woe to woo to wed our grief . 
ALTUS . 

Fond wanton youths , two . fond wanton youths make love a God two . which after proveth a - ges rod , their youth , their time , their wit , their art , they spend in seeking of their smart , and which of follies is the chief they woo their woe , two . they wed their grief , they wed their grief , they wed their grief .

III  

CANTUS 

She whose matchless beauty staineth , what best judgement fairest maintaineth , she OH she my love dis - day - neth , she OH she my love disdaineth . 

2 

Can a creature so excelling , 
Harbour scorn in beauties dwelling , 
All kind pity thence expelling ? 
3 

Pity beauty much commendeth , 
And th'imbracer oft befriendeth , 
When all eye contentment endeth . 
4 

Time proves beauty transitory 
Scorn ; the stain of beauty's glory , 
In time makes the scorner sorry . 
5 

None adores the sun declining , 
Love all love falls to resigning , 
When the sun of love leaves shining . 
6 

So when flower of beauty fails thee , 
And age stealing on assails thee , 
then mark what this scorn avails thee . 
7 

then those hearts which now complaining , 
Feel the wounds of thy disdaining , 
Shall contemn thy beauty waning . 
8 

Yea thine own hart now dear prized , 
Shall with spite and grief surprised , 
Burst to find itself despised . 
9 

When like harms have them requited , 
Who in others harms delighted , 
Pleasingly the wronged are righted . 
10 

Such revenge my wrongs attending , 
Hope still lives on time depending , 
By thy plagues my torments ending . 
ALTUS . 

She whose matchless beauty stay - neth , what best judgement fairest maintaineth , she OH she my love my love dis - daineth , she OH she my love my love dis - daineth . 

BASSUS . 

She whose matchless beau - tie staineth , what best judgement fairest main - tay - neth she OH she my love my love dis - day - neth , she OH she my love my love dis - daineth . 

TENOR .

FOUR  

CANTUS 

Once did I love and yet I live , though love & truth be now for - gotten . then did I joy now do I grieve , that holy vows must needs be broken , that holy vows must needs be broken . 

2 

Hers be the blame that caused it so , 
Mine be the grief though it be little , 
She shall have shame I cause to know : 
What 't is to love a dame so fickle . 
3 

Love her that list I am content , 
For that Camelion like she changes , 
Yielding such mists as may prevent ▪ 
My sight to view her when she rangeth . 
4 

Let him not vaunt that gains my loss , 
For when that he and time hath proved her , 
She may him bring to weeping cross : 
I say no more because I loved her . 
ALTUS . 

Once did I love and yet I live and yet I live , though love and truth be now forgotten , then did I joy now do I grieve , now do I grieve that holy vows must needs be broken , that holy vows must needs must needs be broken . 

BASSUS . 

Once did I love and yet I live and yet I live , though love and truth be now forgot - ten , than did I joy now do I grieve now do I grieve that holy vows must needs be bro - ken , that holy vows must needs be broken . 

TENOR .

v.  

CANTUS 

Led by a strong de - sire to have a thing un - seen , nothing could make me tyre to be to be to be where as I had been , I got her sight which made me think , my thirst was gone because I saw my drink . 

2 

Kept by the careful watch 
Of more than hundred eyes , 
I sought but could not catch 
The thing she not denies : 
't is better to be blind and fast , 
then hungry see thy love and cannot taste . 
3 

But lover's eyes do wake 
When others are at rest , 
And in the night they slake 
The fire of day's unrest : 
Me thinks that joy is of most worth , 
Which painful time & passed fears brings forth . 
4 

Yet husbands do suppose 
To keep their wives by art , 
And parents will disclose 
By looks their children's hart : 
As if they which have will to do , 
Had not the wit to blind such keepers to . 
5 

Peace then ye aged fools 
That know yourselves so wise , 
That from experience schools 
Do think wit must arise : 
Give young men leave to think and say , 
Your senses with your bodies do decay . 
6 

Love ruleth like a God 
Whom earth keeps not in awe , 
Nor fear of smarting rod 
Denounced by reason's law : 
Give grave advice but rest you there , 
Youth hath his course , & will , & you youths were . 
7 

Think not by prying care 
To pick love's secrets out , 
If you suspicious are 
Yourselves resolve your doubt , 
Who seeks to know such deed once done , 
Finds perjury before confession . 
ALTUS . 

Led by a strong de - sire to have a thing unseen , nothing could make me tyre , to be to be to be to be where I had been , I got her sight which made me think , my thirst was gone , because I saw my drink .

VI  

CANTUS 

Lie down poor heart and die a while for grief , think not this world will ever do thee good , fortune fore - warns y● look to thy relief , and sorrow sucks upon thy living blood , than this is all can help thee of this hell , lie down and die , lie down and die , and then thou shalt do well . 

2 

Day gives his light but to thy labours toil , 
And night her rest but to thy weary bones , 
Thy fairest fortune follows with a foil : 
And laughing ends but with their after groans . 
And this is all can help thee of thy hell , 
Lie down and die and then thou shalt do well . 
3 

Patience doth pine and pity ease no pain , 
Time wears the thoughts but nothing helps the mind , 
Dead and alive alive and dead again : 
These are the fits that thou art like to find . 
And this is all can help thee of thy hell , 
Lie down and die and then thou shalt do well ▪ 
ALTUS . 

Lie down poor hart , two . and die a while for grief , think not this world will ever do thee good do thee good , fortune forewarns thou look to thy relief to thy relief , and sorrow sucks upon thy living blood thy living blood , than this is all can rid thee of this hell , lie down and die and die , lie , two . lie , two . and then thou shalt do well .

VII . 

CANTUS 

Where lingering fear doth once possesses doth once possess the hart , there is the tongue forced to prolong , & smother up his suit , while that his smart while that his smart , like fire suppressed like fire suppressed , flames more in every part . 

2 

Who dares not speak deserves not his desire , 
The Boldest face , 
findeth most grace : 
Though women love that men should them admire , 
They slily laugh at him dares come no higher . 
3 

Some think a glance expressed by a sigh , 
Winning the field , 
maketh them yield : 
But while these glancing fools do roll the eye , 
They beat the bush , away the bird doth fly . 
4 

A gentle hart in virtuous breast doth stay , 
Pity doth dwell , 
In beauty's cell : 
A woman's hart doth not though tongue say nay 
Repentance taught me this the other day . 
5 

Which had I wist I presently had got , 
The pleasing fruit , 
Of my long suit : 
But time hath now beguiled me of this lot , 
For that by his foretop I took him not . 
ALTUS . 

Where lingering fear where lingering fear doth once possess , two . the hart doth once possess the hart , there is the tongue forced to prolong & smother up his smart , while that his suit while that his suit , like fire suppressed like fire suppressed , flams more in every part . 

BASSUS . 

Where lingering fear doth once possess , doth once possess the hart , possess the hart , there is the tongue forced to prolong promise - long and smother up his suit , while that his smart while that his smart , two . like fire suppressed like fire suppressed , flames more in every part .

VIII . 

CANTUS 

Hero care not though they pry , I will love thee till I die , je - lou - sie is but a smart , that torments a jealous hart : Crows are black that were white , for betraying love's delight . 

2 

They that love to find a fault , 
May repent what they have sought , 
What the fond eye hath not viewed , 
Never wretched hart hath rued : 
Vulcan then , proved a scorn , 
When he saw he wore a horn . 
3 

Doth it then by might behoove , 
To shut up the gates of love , 
Women are not kept by force , 
But by natures own remorse . 
If they list , they will stray , 
Who can hold that will away . 
4 

jove in golden shower obtained , 
His love in a tower restrained , 
So perhaps if I could do , 
I might hold my sweet love to : 
Gold keep out at the door , 
I have love that conquers more . 
5 

Wherhfore did they not suspect , 
When it was to some effect , 
Every little glimmering spark , 
Is perceived in the dark : 
This is right , how let's kind , 
See by night , by day be blind . 
ALTUS . 

Hero care not though they pry , I will love thee till I die , jealousy is but a smart that torment's a jealous hart a jealous hart , Crows are black that were white , for betraying love's delight .

IX . 

CANTUS 

When love and time and measure makes his ground , time that must end though love can never die , 't is love betwixt a shadow and a sound , a love not in the hart but in the eye , A love that ebbs and flows now up now up now down now down , a morning's favour and an evenings' frown . 

2 

Sweet looks show love , yet they are but as beams , 
Fair words seem true , yet they are but as wind , 
Eyes shed their tears yet are but outward streams : 
Sighs paint a sadness in the falsest mind . 
Looks , words , tears , sighs , show love when love they leave , 
False hearts can weep , sigh , swear , and yet deceive . 
ALTUS . 

When love on time and measure makes his ground , time that must end though love can never die can never die , 't is love betwixt a shadow and a sound , a love not in the hart but in the eye , a love that ebbs a love that ebbs and flows now up now down , two . a morning's favour and an evenings' frown , and an evenings' frown .

2 

O fie upon this long stay , 
That thus my loving hopes delay : 
Come again , come again , two . and say , 
Sweet hart I 'll never more say thee nay . 
3 

Deer be not such a tyrant , 
Still to rejoice thee in my want : 
Come and do , come and do , two . not scant 
Me of thy sight , so fair and pleasant . 
4 

Why hearst thou not his sighing , 
Whose voice all hoarse is with crying : 
Come and do , two . come and do something , 
That may revive thy true love dying .

That they make beggars of all men : 
We must sigh , we must cry , we must die , and then 
Forsooth it may be they will harken .

We men what are we ? fool's and idle boys , 
To spend our time in sporting with such toys .

Where on we suffer shipwreck at our landing :

Farewel dear love since pns wilt needs be gone , mine eyes do show my life is almost done , nay I will never die , so long as I can spy , there be many mother though that she do go there be many mother I fear not , why then let her go I care not . 

2 

Farewell , farewell , since this I find is true , 
I will not spend more time in wooing you : 
But I will seek else where , 
If I may find her there , 
Shall I bid her go , 
What and if I do ? 
Shall I bid her go and spare not , 
OH no no no no I dare not . 
3 

Ten thousand times farewell , yet stay a while , 
Sweet kiss me once , sweet kisses time beguile : 
I have no power to move , 
How now , am I in love ? 
wilt thou needs be gone ? 
Go then , all is one , 
wilt thou needs be gone ? o high thee , 
Nay , stay and do no more deny me . 
4 

Once more farewell , I see loath to depart , 
Bids oft adieu to her that holds my hart : 
But seeing I must lose , 
Thy love which I did choose : 
Go thy ways for me , 
Since it may not be , 
Go thy ways for me , but whither ? 
Go , o but where I may come thither . 
5 

What shall I do ? my love is now departed , 
She is as fair as she is cruel hearted : 
She would not be entreated , 
With prayers oft repeated : 
If she come no more , 
Shall I die therefore , 
If she come no more , what care I ? 
Faith , let her go , or come , or tarry .

CANTUS 

OH My poor eyes that sun whose shine late gave you light doth now decline and set to you to others riseth , she who would sooner die then change , not fearing death delights to range , and now OH now OH now my soul despiseth . 

2 

Yet OH my hart thy state is blessed , 
To find out rest in thy unrest : 
Since thou her slave no more remainest , 
For she that bound thee sets thee free , 
then when she first forsaketh thee : 
Such OH such right by wrong thou gainest . 
3 

Eyes gaze no more , heart learn to hate , 
Experience tells you all too late : 
Fond woman's love with faith still warreth , 
While true desert speaks , writes and gives , 
Some groom the bargain nearer drives : 
And he , OH he the market marreth .

CANTUS 

IF fathers knew but how to leave their children wit as they do wealth , & could constrain them to receive that physic which brings perfect health , the world would not admiring stand , a woman's face , a woman's face and woman's hand . 

2 

Women confess they must obey , 
We men will needs be servants still : 
We kiss their hands and what they say , 
We must commend be 't never so ill . 
Thus we like fools admiring stand , 
Her pretty foot and pretty hand . 
3 

We blame their pride which we increase , 
By making mountains of a mouse : 
We praise because we know we please , 
Poor women are too credulous . 
To think that we admiring stand , 
Or foot , or face , or foolish hand .

CANTUS 

Life is a Poet's fable , & all her days are lies stolen from death's reckoning table , for I die for I die as I speak , death times the notes that I do break . 

2 

Childhood doth die in youth , 
And youth in old age dies , 
I thought I lived in truth : 
But I die , two . now I see , 
Each age of death makes one degree . 
3 

Farewell the doting score , 
Of world's arithmetic , 
Life , I 'll trust thee no more , 
Till I die , two . for thy sake , 
I 'll go by deaths new almanac . 
4 

This instant of my song , 
A thousand men lie sick , 
A thousand kneels are rung : 
And I die as they sing , 
They are but dead and I dying . 
5 

Death is but life's decay , 
Life time , time wastes away , 
then reason bids me say , 
That I die , though my breath 
Prolongs this space of lingering death .
