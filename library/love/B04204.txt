Love lies a-bleeding . 

by whose mortal wounds you May soon understand , 
what sorrows we suffer since love left the land . 
To the tune of , the Cyclops . 





Lay by your pleading 
Love lies a-bléeding , 
Burn all your poetry , and throw away your reading , 
Piety is painted 
And truth is tainted 
Love is a reprobate , and schism now is sainted 
The throne love doth sit on , 
We daily do spit on , 
It was not thus , i was , when Betty ruled in Britain . 
But friendship hath faltered 
Loves altars are altered 
And he that is the cause , i would his neck were haltered 
When love did nourish , 
England did flourish , 
Till holy hate came in , and maids us all so currith , 
Now every widgeon 
Talks of religion , 
But doth as little good as Mahomet and 's pigeon 
Each coxcomb is suiting , 
His words for confuting . 
But heaven 's sooner gained by suffering than by disputing 
True friendship we smother , 
And strike at our brother , 
Apostles never went to God by killing one another . 
Let love but warm ye , 
Nothing can harm ye , 
When love is general , there 's angels in the army 
Love keeps his quarters , 
And fears no tortures 
The bravest fights are written in the book of martyrs 
Could we be so civil , 
To do good for evil , 
It were the only happy way to overcome the devil , 
The flowers love hath watered . 
Sedition hath scattered 
We talk with tongues of holiness , but act with hearts of hatred 
He that doth know me , 
And love will show me , 
Hath found the nearest , noblost way to overcome me . 
He that hath bound me , 
And then doth wound me , 
Wins not my heart , he doth not conquer but confound me , 
In such a condition 
Love is a physician , 
True love and reason makes the purest politician . 
But strife and confusion 
Deceit and delusion 
Though it seems to thrive at first will make a sad conclusion . 
The second part , 

To the same tune 





Love is a jewel , 
A precious jewel , 
't is love must stinch the blood , when fury fights the duel , 
Love is a blood stone 
Hate is a toadstone , 
Heaven is the north-point , and love is the loadstone 
Though fury and scorn 
Loves temples have •orn . 
Hée'l keep his covenant , and will not be for sworn . 
His laws do not border , 
On strife and disorder , 
He scorns to get his wealth by perjury or Marder . 
What falsehood drew in , 
Grace never grew in 
Love will not raise himself upon another's ruin , 
He can present ye 
With peace and plenty 
Love never advanceth one by throwing down of twenty , 
Where love is in season 
There truth is , and reason 
The soul of love is never underlaid with treason , 
He never doth quarrel 
For princely apparel 
Nor ever fixed a chair of state upon a barrel . 
Love from the dull pit 
Or follies full pit 
Ne'er took an anvil out and put it in a pulpit , 
Love is no sinker , 
Truth is no slinker , 
In mending breaches , love did never play the tinkar 
Where vengeance and lust is 
No truth is , nor trust is 
As will appear at last in God's high court of justice 
Pity and remorse is 
The strength of loves forces 
Paul never converted men by stables filled with horses . 
Mercy is fading , 
Truth is degrading , 
Love is the only cause of plenty , peace , & trading 
Love is a fire 
Made of desire 
Whose chief ambition is to heaven to asp 
It stops the gradation 
Of fury and passion 
It governs all good families , & best can guide a nati•• 
The low land , the high land , 
& my land and thy land 
Grew all in common strait , when love had left this island . 
Where peace is painting 
And rage is ranting , 
't is an undoubted sign the King of love is wanting , 
Father and mother , 
Sister and brother 
If love be lacking , quickly mischief one another , 
Where wrath is , the rod is 
That ruins out bodies 
With hate the devil is , but where love is God is , 
Then let us not doubt it , 
But straight go about it 
To bring in love again , we cannot live without it . 
Then let the grace's 
Crown our embraces 
And let us settle all things in their proper places , 
Left persecution 
Cause dissolution . 
Let all purjoined wealth be made a restitution 
For though now it tickles , 
'T will turn all to prickles , 
Then let us live in peace & turn our swords to sickles , 
When Noah's dove was sent out , 
Than God's pardon went out , 
They that would have it so , i hope will say amen to 't .
