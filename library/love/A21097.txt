IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE . 

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL and my very good friend : Sir john Crofts Knight . Michael Este wishes long life , health and happiness , with increase of honour . 

Worshipful Sir : having drawn together these Compositions , and therewith acquainted some of my wellwillers , studious and skilful in the most delectable Science , it pleased them not only with sweet words friendly to approve what I had done , and t'encourage me boldly to goe-on in my course of studies , but also with many arguments earnestly to importune me to publish for a common benefit , which myself had done for my own recreation and private exercise . Thus whet-on I did consent , and do present unto your worship these Musical inventions of mine , not as did the Philosopher his book of justice unto Antigonus , that delighted in oppression ( an unmeete Patron for so sweet and necessary a subject ) ; but as to one addicted to the Muses studious of all good Sciences , excelling in virtue ; delighting in Music ; withal , desiring your Protection and Pardon : Protection of these my labours , the first fruits of my weak studies against depravers ; Pardon for publishing them so boldly under your worship's name : which if I find ( whereof I doubt not ) than shall I be encouraged with more alacrity , both to proceed as I have now begun , and to prepare myself to some greater task . And so I humbly take my leave , wishing all manner good , both unto your worship , and all yours . 

Yours in all love and duty , Michael Este .

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL and my very good friend : Sir john Crofts Knight . Michael Este wishes long life , health and happiness , with increase of honour . 

Worshipful Sir : having drawn together these Compositions , and therewith acquainted some of my wellwillers , studious and skilful in the most delectable Science , it pleased them not only with sweet words friendly to approve what I had done , and t'encourage me boldly to goe-on in my course of studies , but also with many arguments earnestly to importune me to publish for a common benefit , which myself had done for my own recreation and private exercise . Thus whet-on I did consent , and do present unto your worship these Musical inventions of mine , not as did the Philosopher his book of justice unto Antigonus , that delighted in oppression ( an unmeete Patron for so sweet and necessary a subject ) ; but as to one addicted to the Muses ▪ studious of all good Sciences , excelling in virtue ; delighting in Music ; withal , desiring your Protection and Pardon : Protection of these my labours , the first fruits of my weak studies against depravers ; Pardon for publishing them so boldly under your worship's name : which if I find ( whereof I doubt not ) than shall I be encouraged with more alacrity , both to proceed as I have now begun , and to prepare myself to some greater task . And so I humbly take my leave , wishing all manner good , both unto your worship , and all yours . 

Yours in all love and duty , Michael Este .
