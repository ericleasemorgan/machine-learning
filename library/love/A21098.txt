To the Right Worshipful Sir Thomas Gerard Knight . 

SIR , it is not long , since it first pleased you to grace me with your acquaintance . Yet in so little time , I have observed great arguments , of your more than most singular love , to this never sufficiently beloved and admired faculty of Music : as namely , the perfect pleasure and contentment you seem to take therein ; Your indefatigable assiduity in the private exercise thereof , which hath gained you such a perfection that way , as is rare in a Gentleman of your rank : 

And lastly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poor self , and others , such as myself ; the sons of Music , when by chance you light among us. Unworthy were I then of that thrice worthy Mother , unworthy to be phrased a son of Music , should I not heartily affect and honour you , in such sort as I do , whom I find so entirely to love and honour her . And hence it is , even of my love which you have well deserved for loveing her so well , that I have singled you out among so many my worshipful good friends for the Patron of these my second labours , & have first presented them unto your name , that under your protection and countenance they might pass abroad into the world . May it please you therefore to entertain them , coming from a good affection , with a favourable acceptance ▪ which I assure myself you● gentelnesse will vouchsafe to do ; especially since they come in so seasonable a time , at the very entrance of a new year , when usually all gifts are well taken , even trifles at their hands whose ability will not reach to present matters of higher worth : And so I humbly take my leave , 

from Ely house in Holborn . Yours in all love and duty , Michael Est .
