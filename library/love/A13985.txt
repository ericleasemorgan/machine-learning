The true hearted l•••• or 

A youngman sent a letter to his love , 
Showing to her his mind could not remove : 
But for true love he love again doth crave , 
If false she prove , than he must to the grave . 
To the tune of , i fancy none but thee alone . 



My loving friend i do commen• 
Myself most kindly unto you , 
Wishing your health your joy and wea••h 
Most like unto a lover true , 
For Cupid's dart , hath struck my he•••… 
And i no remedy can find , 
Your love it is , the cause of this , 
Therefore sweet love prove not unkind . 
Your love so soon , my heart did woun• 
That i no longer can forbear . 
•ill you my love , with it be moved , 
And that an answer i do hear , 
I shall not rest , for i protest , 
That i do love you as my heart , 
Therefore my dear , let love appear , 
To love again it is thy part . 
If thou shouldst not what were my lot 
The time and day i should repent 
That ever my love , to thee i mo  
My heart with sorrow •••ld be spent , 
Because my love , cannot remove . 
But it will bréeve my deadly pain , 
Then sweet prone kind , that i May find , 
For love , fou•e love of thee again . 
Or else my pain will still remain , 
No joy nor comfort i can have . 
Until that death hath stopped my breath , 
And brought my body to the grave , 
Thy lovely looks , are baiting hooks , 
And they so fast have catcht my heart , 
That none but thee , can remedy , 
My grief , my woe , my pain and smart . 
Seeing in thy hands , my life if stands , 
Consider well my grief and moan , 
If thou didst know , the grief and woe , 
That i suffer for thee alone , 
Thy heart i think , if it were flint , 
It could not choose but grant me love , 
For i love thee , most faithfully , 
And till i die I 'll not remove . 
So love adieu , thy lover true , 
••ll he doth hear from thee again , 
Prays for thy health , thy joy and wealth , 
Hoping thou will not breed his pain , 
So i will pray both night and day 
The Lord to have thee in hi•  
So till i hear , from thee my d•••• 
Adieu my love , and only sweet  
The second part ▪ 

To the same tune . or 

 kind mai•… answer 
〈◊〉 〈◊〉 true to thee as Hero to Leander , 
I 'll be thy love , thou shalt be my commander , 
As in my answer plainly shall be shown , 
Let Hymen join , and then i am thy own . 


Thanks love for thy commendations , 
Unto me so kindly sent , 
I it receive with kind embracing , 
I 'll not breed thee discontent , 
Though Cupid's shaft with a full draught , 
Did aim aright and pierce thy heart , 
The wound I 'll cure i thee assure . 
And ease thee of that grievous smart . 
If it be i thy heart have wounded , 
'T was a thing to me unknown , 
Be not then in sorrows drowned , 
For for that vowed to us thy own , 
But rest in peace , let love increase , 
I will thee love while i have breath , 
I will not part , from thee sweet heart , 
Until that i am forced by death . 
Thy lot 's according to thy wishing , 
To repent thou hast no cause , 
With kind embraces and with hissing , 
I will keep God Cupid's laws , 
Ere false I 'll prove , to thee my love 
Or do thee wrong by day or night , 
I rather choose , my life to loose , 
Then wrong my love and hearts delight . 
 pain I 'll strive to ease thee , 
 to love good comfort take , 
 •ight shall be to please thee , 
I 'll die ere i will thee forsake , 
But unto thee as true I 'll be , 
As is the turtle to his mate , 
Whilst life thou hast , my love is plat'st , 
If life thou loose , my life I 'll hate . 
Thy plaints and moan i have regarded , 
My hand and heart be ever thine . 
I have thy love with love rewarded , 
As thy hand and heart is mine , 
So shall it rest , within my breast , 
I 'll entertainment give unto it , 
I 'll it relieve , I 'll not it grieve ; 
 •ather lose my life then do it . 
So with my love and true affection , 
I do now my love commend , 
Unto the hands and the protection , 
Of him that doth all blessings send , 
And so i end , thy loving friend , 
Hath now her love to thee made known 
In hymen's bands , let us join hands , 
And then my love i am thine own . 
Finis .
