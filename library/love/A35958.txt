col . 3. 16.  

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly , in all wisdom , teaching and admonishing one another in psalms , and hymns , and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord . 



Edinburgh , printed by Andro Anderson , anno dom . 1655.  

To the reader . 

Since Christ's fair truth craves no man's art , 
Take this rude song in better part . 
True Christian love . 

I have a heart for love , and love 
i cannot choose but have , 
A love that can give full content , 
The least as i can crave . 
I want not , suitors , and they all 
Have agents still with me , 
Who promise that which i do seek , 
But sure i know they lie . 
Though honour height to lift me up , 
And mammon me to serve : 
Yet their attendants scars me not , 
Nor makes my heart to swerve . 
Pale fear , dusk envy , care and toil , 
With other ill hewed wights 
Wait for my service if i weed , 
Their Masters , oh what sights . 
The only thing like to prevail , 
Was match unto my mind : 
When fancy buskde my party with , 
Perfections of each kind . 
But now i see that fancy is , 
Not real as it seems : 
no earthly love can give content , 
All loves but Christ's are dreams . 
Then why want i contenting love , 
Since Christ's love May be had : 
In whom is all that i do seek , 
Or can be thought or said ? 
What other loves do seem to have , 
Is truly in him found ; 
The scattered beauties of them all 
In him are jointly bound . 
What they do lack and cannot have ▪ 
Because they finit be , 
it 's infinite , in him it stands 
For ever still : oh he , 
He , he is only worthy love , 
And nothing else but he , 
Alas , that vanity so long 
Hath so bewitched me . 
Why heard i flattering idols words ? 
Why did i parley keep : 
Why suffered i affection 
To sing me so asleep ? 
How went i on so foolishly , 
And kept so oft their tryst , 
As if false loves could be found true , 
And had no mind of Christ . 
No , not when Christ was suiting me , 
And they found oft untrue : 
I stack still in their bonds and could 
Myself no ways rescue . 
Yet good and wise Lord Jesus Christ , 
Did still pursue my love : 
He knew though i refused , my heart 
Was his ; he could me move . 
And now it 's done , my love is thine , 
Lord Jesus home receive 
This whorish heart , and suffer not 
My soul hence to deceive . 
There shall my suiters all me serve , 
But thou my love shall be , 
They shall be mine , not i theirs , else 
They shall not follow me . 
Thus shall i have advantage twice , 
And blessed shall be my lot , 
I 'll get my lover's goods , and love 
Above theirs , well i wot . 
A love that will not me despise , 
Though i unworthy be , 
Though vile and loathsome , yet will he 
Not loath but pity me . 
Though fickle i , he will not change , 
His constancy is known ; 
Of change no shadow is with him , he loves for ay his own : 
When i for want of wit , and strength 
Offend and do confess : 
He will not chide but pardon me , 
My faults both more and less . 
He will not charge upon me lay , 
More nor i May well bear , 
but will my burdens as i need , 
Support , i do not fear . 
No wrath at others will cause him 
Unpleasant be to me : 
No flanderer will get his ear , 
To hear of me a lie . 
He will not misconstruct my words , 
He will not angry be : 
Nor fret without a cause , nor frown , 
Nor fitch a fault falsely . 
Nor mark my ways so narrowly , 
As nothing to pass by : 
His love will hide my sin in love , 
Faith safely May rely . 
He will not waste his heritage , 
Nor will himself disgrace , 
No foes can hurt him , and their spit , 
He turns upon their face . 
His love to other saints shall not , 
Work prejudice to me , 
More than the sun's light unto all , 
Doth hinder me to see . 
No causeless jealousy will vex 
At any time his mind , 
But if he see my heart go wrong , 
I know he is so kind , 
As to admonish and rebuke , 
And chasten if it need , 
And so me save from perishing , 
Too oft deserved indeed . 
If i be sad , he will be loath , 
Yet more to vex my heart , 
If any other will do so , 
Against them he 'll take my part : 
And those that grieve me he will grieve , 
And curse them more and less , 
That curseth me , so will he those that bless me surely bless . 
If trouble set about me round , 
He will not me forsake . 
Nor leave me comfortless alone , but pity on me take . 
And if he hide his face a while , 
As wisdom oft requires : 
He doth but excercise my faith , 
And sharpen my desires . 
And if he seem to stay well long , 
That i become so dead , 
As i can neither say nor sing , 
Nor meditate , nor read , 
Nor do aught else that Might asswadge 
Hearts pangs in such a case , 
But sit and drop and hang my head , 
Long looking for his grace . 
Uttering but broken words or none , 
Perplexed with thoughts confused , 
Suggestions whisper all the while , 
As if i were refused , 
Yet still his gracious hand doth me 
Support , with secret strength : 
and makes me in these deeps not drown , 
But brings me through at length . 
Mean time he keeps my scattered words , 
And failing those my tears : 
In books and bottles , and takes course , 
To rid me out of fears . 
And failing both my words and tears , 
He makes each woeful groan : 
And failing those , my sighs , and all 
The parcels of my moan . 
Yea ; when i fit astonished , 
My lifted hands and looks : 
Speaks all my mind to him , as if 
It written were in books . 
For he doth search the heart and knows , 
What is the spirits mind : 
And as its fit , gives answer to 
Needs cry , in every kind . 
And look how sharp these trials are , 
Their fruit is far more sweet : 
His countenance compenseth all , 
With one blink when we meet . 
For he doth make my heart more glad , 
Than any tongue can tell : 
Though grief was great , yet joy is now , 
More sweet nor grief was fell . 
For judge ye whosoever felt , 
What weight in sin , what grief , 
In mind oppressed what angnish is ; 
When soul sees no relief , 
what torment in perplexity , 
What horror in God's wrath , 
What hell in feared eternity , 
At losing of his breath ? 
And presuppon a soul were sure 
To dwell at last above , 
In heaven with Christ , yet know ye not , 
What langour is in love ? 
What sickness in deferred-hopes ? 
What battle with our so : 
What trouble when God hides his face , 
And seems us to forgo ? 
Now judge again , when weights are lift 
Grief , anguish , torments gone . 
For wrath , death , hell , eternity , 
Of fear now there is none . 
But in their place the heart lift up ; 
Life , light , and rest , is come 
Felt love , peace , victory , heart's health , 
And Christ's spirit , all in sum . 
Judge when our much prokocked Lord , 
Himself shows reconciled , 
If with the joy that then is felt , 
A heart May not be filled . 
Now what can others love do here , 
To soul in such a case 
But add more grief , and make the veil 
More thick to hide Christ's face . 
Than others loves all get you gone , 
Or else take servants place : 
too hard conditions were to me , 
For you to quite his face , 
For one hour's joy in him is more , 
Though mixed with driery tears , 
Than all earth's honour , pleasure , wealth 
Can yield in many years . 
Now let me rest and ruse my love , 
Who first me loved , and choosed , 
And long called for my wortalesse love , 
And would not be refused . 
I 'll seek his love , as he sought mine , 
And learn of him to love , 
Since he invites i cannot miss , 
Though while he shall me prove . 
My love 's his father's elder son , 
His father , King of Kings : 
His heritage is heaven and earth 
And in them both all things . 
His wisdom laid the world's round , 
And parted sea and land , 
Earth's body through , as vines he drew 
The waters with his hand . 
He made the sun and stars so swift , 
Yet not be seen to move , 
Least men on earth had vexed been 
With motions from above . 
His strength upholds this weighty globe 
And yet which is far more , 
He bare our sins and heavy wrath , 
Deserved of us therefore : 
For truth God's promises in him , 
Are all , yea , and amen : 
For love , his death for us a proof , 
Sufficient hath been . 
For justice he can do no wrong , 
For mercy there is none 
Or shall in hell be , who have sought 
For grace through him alone . 
Most lofty and most lowly mind , 
Most good and most severe , 
Most lovely , and most terrible . 
Do all in him cohere . 
The meekest lamb to all his friends , 
A lion to his foes , 
He gives his peace to all that comes , 
Wrath follows all that goes . 
No foe can stand before his face , no fugitive can flee , 
No lurking hole can hide from him , 
His eyes do all things see . 
Almighty , all where present , though , 
His body heaven contain , 
Eternal God , though he as man , 
Man's properties retain . 
No robry for his majesty his father's match to be , 
The father's godhead and the spirits , 
And his are one all three , 
Therefore when i do love the son , 
I love the father too : 
and so the spirit who dwell in him , 
To all i worship do . 
He is the tree of life to me , 
And so to all his own , 
No fiery sword debars us now , 
All we for friends are known : 
In him my Sabbath is begun , 
He teacheth me to cease 
From mine own works , and leads me to 
His rest by steps , of peace . 
Flood branchd in four to water all 
New plants of paradise , 
Redeemed , and holy , making them , 
And righteous and wise , 
Though we have slain him , yet his blood 
Speaks better things for us , 
Then Abel's crying curse but his 
Cries , Lord be gracious . 
Though wrath should overflow the land , 
As with a new deluge , 
Or fire consume the earth , yet Christ's 
Safe ark is for refuge , 
For now no wrath unmixed with love , 
Shall of his own be felt , 
Because God in his sacrifice , 
The smell of rest hath smelled . 
And as the bow in cloud is pawn 
Of not returning flood : 
So is that offering constant pledge 
Of our eternal good . 
True Isaac offered up to me , 
Not minted at but slain : 
Most Isaac like in this escape , 
Though slain he rose again 
Sweet Joseph by his brethren sold , 
By our means made to serve : 
He hath provided well our food , 
Least we through want should starve , 
From Egypt's bonds and slavery base , 
it 's he that sets us free : 
it 's he that doth prepare our way , 
Through floods and raging sea . 
The prophet raised like Moses true , 
But fruitfuller than he , 
He law , and curse , and types of good , 
Christ , grace and truth gives me . 
My duty Moses shows but strength 
None can he give to do , 
But Christ , by teaching gives me life , 
And will , and action to . 
The priest that offered only once ; 
And pacified for ay : 
And needs not aaron-like repeat 
His sacrifice each day . 
For Aaron's offering oft did prove 
His offering unperfite , 
But Christ's because it perfect makes , 
God still our sins to quite . 
In him all leaves and types are filled . 
In him they have an end , 
no further use of them since God 
Did Christ their substance send , 
No priest by office now on earth , 
No proper sacrifice , 
No alter of materials 
No fixed place of service . 
The tent where God dwells bodily , 
The temple where the tryst , 
Is set for meeting of our God , 
As reconciled is Christ . 
He ark with ready angels eled . 
He mercy seat of God , 
Access , and oracles of peace , 
Giving to us abroad . 
By him the withered rod bears fruit , 
With him is manna hide , 
The law in him lies closed from speech , 
Except through mercy's lid . 
By him my prayers are perfumed 
And smell as incense sweet : 
By him my cup is furnished , 
And table filled with meat . 
The priest , the alter and the lamb , 
The laver washing all : 
And what else any rite did sign , 
He fills up great and small . 
The judge which rids his persons from 
All adversary's hand . 
Our kindly King by whom we May 
Possess that promised land . 
To all his iubjects affable , 
Above all earthly Kings , 
His basest servants have his ear , 
At all times in all things . 
He is the churches darest love , 
And therefore must be mine , 
Though i be base , yet will his grace 
To be my love incline . 
Oft hath he proved his love to me , 
And will not now decline , 
Oft hath his love much sweeter been 
To me then finest wine 
Oft hath the preaching of his word , 
In straits and fears of death , 
As sweetest kisses been to me , 
Convoyed with lively breath . 
Oft hath his apples hunger stayed , 
My thirst his flagons quenched , 
Oft hath his shadow me refreshed , 
As herbs by dew bedrenched 
Oft in his love withdrawing , he 
From bed hath made me rise , 
And seek him long before i found , to make me after wise . 
And when we met , his wrath was gone , 
He called me spouse betrothed , 
And washing me by pardon , said 
My fair love though self loathed : 
Now fairest love , let my soul say , 
Who made me clean but thou ? 
Who made a child of wrath like me 
Stand reconciled now . 
What makes me lovely , but thy love 
That set the price on me : 
Whose beauty makes me fair but thine 
What have i not from thee : 
My exaltation is come , 
To be a child of God 
By thy descending to be man , 
And some while here abode : 
Thy clean conception and birth , 
Proves thee to be the tree : 
Where cut from Adam's filthy stock 
•impted clean must be . 
Thy manger makes my bed more soft , 
Thy stable gives me inns : 
Thy banishment home brings me where , 
My countrypeople wins . 
Thy wisdom in thy childhood hides 
My foolish youthly toys , 
Thyself devoting unto griefs 
Is ground of all my joys . 
Thy emptying my fullness is , 
Thy meanness me Promots . 
Thy hiding of thy royal state 
A kingdom me allots . 
Thy servant's shape and service done , 
From service sets me free ▪ 
And bondage of proud Satan's yoke , 
And sins strong tyranny . 
Thy lurking thirty years unknown , 
For ever makes me shine 
With glory far above the reach 
Of subtlest engine . 
Thy name enrolled in sinner's book , 
By baptism makes my name 
To be inrolde among the saints , 
Even those of greatest fame . 
Thy offering suretyship for me 
To God at Jordans' bank , 
Hath freed me of my sins , and hell , 
Well's me and God i thank , 
I hear thee say to God , behold 
Me and my children all : 
I hear the father answer thee , 
I love you great and small . 
I hear thee say : take me for them , 
Let me their burden bear : 
I hear the father cry , content 
Come children , come and hear . 
Come hear the covenant between 
Me and my dearest son , 
Come give your hearts consent thereto , 
And then your bargan's done . 
I hear thee say , man's due is death , 
I 'll do thy will , oh Lord . 
My soul and body both for theirs , 
Let suffer i accord . 
I hear thy father's voice from heaven 
Cry , lovely son art thou 
These all , and this , ( And that was i ) 
Are thine , I 'm pleased now . 
I hear him say to all , and me , 
Go hear my son and live : 
He drew . I came thou welcomed me ; 
And life i feel dost give ? 
Now take me with thee where thou wilt 
For we must never shed . 
In faith my soul is glued to thee , 
Lead me as blind are led . 
Cross Satan's teeth , if our way lie ▪ 
And cross each other foe 
To priests , to beanch , to Golgotha , 
Lead me and i will go . 
But lead ; and leave me not , or else 
i cannot miss to fall : 
If thou do hold me in thy hand , 
I fear no foe at all . 
Thy combats makes me not amazed , 
For what could make me woe : 
Thy victory my conflict makes , 
To be with vanquished so . 
Thy going to the wilderness 
Brings me to saints city : 
Thy fighting all alone makes me 
Fight in thy company : 
Thy being tempted forty days , 
All my days makes me sure , 
thy presence , help and comfort shall 
With tempted me endure . 
If by some wrong mean i be tempt , 
To fill my nature's lust , 
Or God to tempt , neglecting means , 
Under pretence of trust . 
To help or hazard life , some way , 
Which God will not allow : 
I see thee still before me , Lord , 
My helper here be thou . 
it 's true my flesh doth grieve to think , 
What May thy saints befall , 
What horrible suggestions , 
And blasphemies withal . 
What shapes and apparitions , 
By night some , some by day : 
Yea power of this flesh , yet thou 
So usde my fear do stay . 
Most dangerous of all , methinks , 
When Satan God to scorn , 
In false religion worship craves , 
And hids both hoof and horn . 
And angellike in some man's mouth , 
Bids to some image bow , 
And worldly motives brings thy truth 
To cause me disavow . 
In this case Lord give light , that i 
May Satan bid avoid : 
for thousands here for fault of light 
Guild have been and destroyed . 
To free me from this ill , i know 
New trouble shall me breed : 
And make the world me persecute 
With spite , in word and deed . 
But so i May thy truth contain , 
And still adhere to thee : 
I fear no persecution , 
Nor wickeds' injury . 
More hatred can i not , than thou , 
No more despised be : 
More charged with bitter calumniès , 
Nor ofter get the lie . 
More scorned and mocked in my face ▪ 
More followed at the back : 
Finger and tongue shut forth withal , 
Murgeons that mockers make . 
Less welcome where i offer love ; 
Less thanked for good deeds : 
Worse entertained in my country , 
Worse furnished in my needs : 
More friendly handled by my friends , 
And those of mine own blood , 
Then thou was , i , yea none can be 
Who suffer shall for good . 
What can befall me which did not 
Before befall to thee ? 
What more distressed for righteousness , 
Can i expect to be ? 
What ludging less than lie thereout ? 
What harder bed than rocks : 
What sharper rest than not to sleep , 
Or to preveene the cocks , 
What scant or want , more than to have 
No penny in my purse . 
Among such persons as me hate , 
And in their heart me curse . 
What greater hunger then to fast , 
And when it 's come to eat , 
To send and buy some course piece bread 
And get no other meat . 
What greater drought than want a drink , 
In journey at midday ? 
And for a drink of water call , 
And hear on say me nay ? 
What spoil of goods more than to strip 
Me naked to the skin , 
And in my sight divide my clothes , 
And then to scorn begin . 
What danger more than present death , 
By stones lift up to cast . 
There steep down rocks , here man adjudgd , 
To be thrown down made fast . 
What banished can i more be then 
For life chased here and there : 
Without a hole to hide my head , 
Which even to beasts is rare ? 
What prison worse than fall in hands 
Of persecuting priests , 
thirsting like wolves for blood of saints 
To grace their godless feasts ? 
What judgement more unjust than find 
My party sit as judge , 
And still the less fault he can find , 
The more at me to grudge ? 
And if i speak a modest truth 
To smite me on the face : 
And pull the hair off head and cheeks , 
And all me to disgrace . 
What torment more than pricks thrust in 
on 's head fourscore at once ? 
Yea all the flesh with scourging rent , 
And nothing safe but bones . 
And those so racked in all joints , 
As sinews none go free . 
But legs and arms asunder spelde , 
Hung up and nailed on tree . 
And what Might seem to be untouchde , 
Thy tender bowels all . 
So burned as slockning welcome was , 
By vinegar and gall . 
All this thou suffered , Lord , and more 
Than any can express . 
Why should i then be feared for such 
Like suffering more , or less . 
Thou came to witness for the truth , 
And so must all thine do : 
Thou came to suffer for the truth , 
And so must all thine too . 
None follow thee , except they be 
Content thy cross to bear : 
None crowned shall be , except they will 
For truth thy livery wear . 
The truth is limit to thy word , 
Thine and none others saw ; 
Thy scriptures meaning thou wilt have 
My rule and thy full law . 
Oh that i were inclined to do 
What duties there are named ! 
Then when i suffer should for truth 
I could not be ashamed : 
And suffer must we , else do wrong , 
When men from age to age , 
To chop and change thine ordinance 
Run headlong in a rage , 
And by their own traditions 
Do make thy precepts void , 
Urging their own will more than thine , 
So lies thy law destroyed . 
But thou Lord , over all declares 
Such worship to be vain : 
And ere we yield , thy jealousy 
Wills rather we be slain . 
Yea ere we do a needless work 
And weaken little ones , 
We choose our urgers should us sink 
In deep seas with millstones . 
Then strengthen , Lord , my faith in thee , 
That flesh i do not fear . 
But fear May only thine offence , 
Whose love be bought so dear , 
And since thou hast me bought so dear , 
Why May i not be sure : 
That love which made thee pay my price 
Shall steadfastly endure ? 
If i should lean to my freewill 
Or strength , i could not stand , 
Oft had i perished , if my life 
Had line in mine own hand . 
i wonder not that such as lean 
To their works , will or strength , 
Fit , others for , and make themselves 
Apostasy at length . 
For such do not deny themselves , and so not follow thee , 
I chased am to thee for refuge , and so preserved must be . 
Chased souls are sensible of sin , 
And sensible of wrath . 
And flee from both to thee for life , 
And in thee draw their breath . 
How then can such not persevere , 
And so be saved at length , 
Whom thou dost empty of their own , 
And fills with thy fresh strength . 
These are the souls that come to thee . 
Whom thou wilt not cast out : 
These souls are drawn and driven to thee , 
Whom thou must save no doubt 
These are thy sheep for whom thou prays 
For whose life thou didst die 
Whom liars shall not long deceive , 
Whom none can pull from thee . 
These did thy father give to thee , 
With this express command , 
Son ? see thou loss not one of those , 
I 'll crave them at thine hand . 
Keep them and make them persevere , 
And lead them all the way , 
Through life and death , and raise them up 
To glory at that day 
Thou dost accept this charge and pawns , 
Thy honour charge to keep . 
Our faithful shepherd well i know 
Not slumber will nor sleep . 
These sin and law chased souls thou Counts 
True isaaks all to be : 
Children of promise styling them , and heirs annexed with thee . 
These are God's elect , whom he hath 
Predestinat of old , 
And in his council hath decreed 
To save as he hath told . 
Whom to assure of endless life 
By his unchanged decree , 
His truth and oath he laid in pawn , 
In which he cannot lie , 
And swore by his eternal self , 
For greater there was none : 
that of this elect company 
There should not perish one : 
And though these souls like ship on sea 
May fearfully be tossed . 
And while May seem close overwhelmed 
Yet none such shall be lost . 
Their anchor lies within the veil , 
No wind can make it drive : 
It lies where thou art landed Lord , 
And where we shall arrive . 
Now who so saith that thy elect 
For all this perish May 
And that thy saints of purpose called 
From thee May fall away . 
And loses us from leaning on 
The strength of thy right hand : 
They draw from building on the rock , 
And bids us build on sand , 
They say Peter and Judas are 
Alike beloved of thee , 
And that they both for gifts received , 
Alike beholden be : 
As Judas for his perishing , 
May wit the love of pelf : 
So Peter his freewill for life 
May praise and thank himself . 
They say thou knowest not who are thine ▪ 
Of none they make thee sure : 
They say the Lord's foundation 
Doth not ay firm endure : 
they say thou chooses some to day , 
And casts them off the morn : 
They make thee like vain man to be , 
And do thy counsel scorn . 
They make thee pray for thine elect , 
And not get thy request : 
Yea though thou for them live for ay , 
To intercede as priest . 
God's elect whom to he gives right , 
To be his sons and heirs , 
They make them want sure right to have , 
The heritage for theirs . 
That saints till death seduced May be , 
And sheep pulled from thine hand , 
Whom god thee charged to keep and save 
To say , they do not stand . 
Thy word , thy oath , thy covenant 
They make no certainty : 
Faith's anchor they make drive , they speak 
In iubstance blasphemy . 
They make the merchand nothing wise , 
And very short of thought ▪ 
Who paid the price , and was not sure 
To have what thou had bought : 
Yea , so unwise , as for thy sheep 
Thine own life not to spare , 
Whom thou May loss , though so dear bought 
Such foolish blocks are rare . 
Oh wicked thoughts be far from me , 
I know thy love doth last : 
and whom of purpose thou dost call 
Thy grace doth hold them fast . 
Whom thou dost love for them thou died , 
For whom thou died they live : 
Thy love , thy ransoning , and heaven , 
All jointly thou dost give . 
And whosoever hates his sin , and sets his love on thee , 
May be assured thou loudest him first , 
And for his life didst die , 
Now , Lord , thou knows i hate my sin , 
And seeks to have it slain ▪ 
Thou that knows all , knows i thee love , 
And feels it not in vain . 
Then Lord my love thou wilt allow , 
That i apply thy death . 
And by that means persuaded rest , 
To be exeemd from wrath , 
And well i wot the ransom is 
Sufficient enough 
Me to redeem from hell , and imp 
Me in thee as thy bough . 
For me thou emptied thyself , and stood in father's awe : 
For me thou emptied thyself , and fulfilled the law . 
For me thou took on thee the curse , 
And felt thy father's wrath : 
For me oft plunged was thy soul , 
And heavy to the death , 
for which i sinfully did laugh , 
Thou mourned and wept full sore : 
For pleasure taken in my sin 
Through grief oft didst thou roar . 
For mine ill words thou silencd was , 
And knew not what to say : 
For mine ill deeds thou Lord was bound , 
Condemned and led away . 
Thy ditty were each one my wrongs 
Against both god and man : 
Thy sentence was my due desert 
For sins whereto i run . 
These lashes laid upon thy skin , 
Those stripes and all thy wounds 
Were for my souls wounds made with sin ▪ 
Oh love which thus abounds ! 
Oh thus my love to see thee sad , 
Oh thus to see thee weep : 
Oh thus to hear thee groan and pant , 
And cry with sighs cut deep . 
Oh agony ! Oh fearful sweat ! 
Oh tears ! Oh bloody drops ! 
How mingled down from cheeks to feet 
Each chasing other hops . 
To see my love for love of me 
On bloody shoulders bear 
That cross , that curse , that growing wrath 
And trembling thus for fear . 
To see almighty God so weak , 
Life's fountain thus to die : 
with shame & pain ou'rchargd , till heaven 
Wondered and all for me . 
Woes me for all my sins ! woes me , 
For roots of sin so strong : 
Which have so long time grown in me , 
And like to stick so long : 
Oh help my love ▪ to have them slain : 
Oh here revenge thy death ! 
Oh on this ill avenge me too , 
Which wronged us both so hath : 
Well's me , i wot thou wilt anon 
Grant this , and each request : 
Anon our joy perfect shall be , 
Anon our marriage feast . 
For as thou died for me , for me 
So also didst thou rise : 
And reigns as God , and shall me fetch , 
So makes thy word me wise . 
Fond lovers ! tell me now if you 
Have any love like this ? 
Come take a share with me , my love 
Wholly spiritual is . 
Come change your loves ▪ and love with me 
Or else you perish shall : 
Go charge your loves to do the same , 
Or perish shall you all : 
God's curse on him that loveth not 
My love Lord Jesus Christ : 
Or loves not them that do love him , 
This curse with death keeps tryst ▪ 
〈◊〉 this is my love , yet if 
〈◊〉 could like your love die , 
All these excellencies of his 
Should work my misery . 
Or yet if i by death could be 
Deprived of this my love : 
All that is said or can be more 
Were naught to my behoove . 
But now my love shall never die , 
His days shall never end ; 
His life shall eternize his love , 
His life to love doth tend . 
And i by death shall have no loss , 
My love shall then be more , 
Both mine to him , and his to me , 
Blessed be God therefore . 
Yea , and because i cannot live , 
And broke his love beneath , 
My chariot to eternal life 
Death he appointed hath . 
Therefore till death his love shall be 
The best part of my life : 
In him I 'll strive 'gainst base loves , 
And death will end the strive . 
Only , my Lord , still pity me , 
And tarry not too long : 
My spirit and flesh cry , come Lord , come 
Death shall renew my song . 
Finis .
