heb. 7. 8.  

there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . 

As of the whole epistle , so of the verse now read : Aaron and Christ ; the law and the gospel ; death and life ; of it and that ; these the {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , they are the sum . in it then , this verse , ye have priesthood , compared with priesthood ; upon the a appearing of the one , of the other ye have the falling down ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} here , in this Levi's dying : in that , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there , Melchizedec's living ; of the one the declining , it serves to set out the dignity of the other . when among many arguments of saint Paul's , this portion of scripture it is b one by which he intimates to the Jew , what a great priest in respect of Aaron , Melchizedec was ; that the excellency of the levitical priesthood , it was nothing to that of the Messiah : if an Hebrew could but tell him how much for worth living did excel dying ; then happily he Might guess in glory and in repute , how exceedingly the priesthood of the gospel doth transcend that of the law . for touching the priesthood Judaical , it was of no other make than its priests , in its condition merely mortal : a life indeed it had , but such a life that was but as a span ; in it its priest were {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} men that die : and this is that which the meanness doth denote , of this priesthood the worthlessness . but now as for Christ : c {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} consider how great this man is ; who is a priest , d {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : for ever after the order of Melchizedec : and in respect of this , his eternity is infered over the legal , of his priesthood the praeeminenty : for this order of Melchizedec , as it was afore that of Aaron's , so it is after ; when the e mosaical in such sort it entered in , that in no wise it should abolish that of Melchizedec ; sed ad r•borandum potius & illustrius readendum : but rather to be its strength ; and in a greater lustre to set it forth : for this it came in that in publishing its own unprofitableness to the excellency of that under which we are , it Might give a grace ; f and so , no need for us now in point of tithe to look at Levi ; no need to urge a duty from a law that 's dying ; when from the law first in force , the latter law did no way derogate ; Aaron's claim touching these did no way prejudice Melchisedec's right . Ad tempus decimas levitis . tithes to Levi , they were but a temporary due ; the men that did receive , they were men that die ▪ to ••em , these , they became dead , their order once laid in its grave . but now Melchizedec , Christ ; in the text , the he who receives with disconsolate Job he could ne'er say , g to corrupiion thou art my father , to the worm thou art my mother . h death over him it had ne'er power . i {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . he , made he is a priest after the power of an endless life . tithes then to receive , he it is who is alive ; for he saith it , k {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , i am he that liveth and was dead ; and behold i am alive for evermore . thus the eternal debt of tithes to make it good , to him it is that we betake us ; to no other than of Christ the everduring priesthood : for {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there , in the priesthood of Melchizedec , of the gospel ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . 

the sovereignty of Christ's priesthood in the text over the Jewish , being manifested from its eternity ; jus decimarum , the right too of tithes , sub evangelio , it doth manifest to be as lasting : a necessity there is of having these under the gospel , since of its priest we have such certainty : when {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there , in the priesthood of the gospel ; he , Melchizedec , Christ receiveth tithes ; of whom it is witnessed , that is , witnessed by the scriptures : for so l expositors give the meaning of testatum est . in the scripture it is witnessed , that he , Christ , Melchizedec liveth ; who there , in the priesthood of the gospel receiveth tithes . of these words therefore for the clearer handling , i am to deliver them under a threefold quaere : quis , who receives ? quantum , how much he receives ? quare , why he receives ? 

1.  quis , who receives ? for here we do begin ; the original of tithes , fetch it we must from the condition of the party , whose of these was the first recept : then quis , who receives ? Is he ; for his kind of life , in the text , he who receives ; is he ; a priest he is : for he whose dues these are , M {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . none but a priest he is , whose of these is the right primordiall : tithes and a priest , they are much of a standing ; of the * office no sooner the appearance but unto it of the deserved reverence ye have the performance . He then who receives in the text is a priest ; and is to be considered two ways ; either 

1. {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in the figure , or for the work sake which he underwent , and by way of subserviency ; and so , is he , is Melchizedec ; who was of Christ the type ; the priest presentative , he receives tithes : or else consider this priest . 

2. {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} in the truth , and of these dues as he is the proprietary ; so none but Christ , who is n {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} the great high priest , is he , Jesus Christ receives tithes . This the he who in the gospel is the tithe-taker . in the law , the text {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} here , 't is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} men ; o {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , they were many priests to whom this portion was delivered : but under grace , in the texts {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} no more than one he , one priest . he who receives there , is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : the priest god-man , he receives . This the first quaere , quis ; who receives : the second follows , which is 

Ii quantum ; how much it is this priest receives ? for that a right he hath to somewhat of each ones goods it will pass unquestioned : yet his right runs not at large : for the muchity of that he receives it th 'end left at random : that he should take so much now , and thus much then ; here this , and there that ; more at one time , and less at another ; nor , doth the priest refer himself for what he receives , to the pleasure of those who are bound to give ; but of that he takes the quantum : so much it is , as he once and for ever hath been pleased to determine of ; in the text it is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} tithes : of what is yours , he hath severed for himself a special , a peculiar part . What he had of Abraham he requires now of you : you must give , as Abraham gave ; as he , so the p faithful . now for the quantum which Abraham did impart , praecisen it was {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} a tenth ; so much is the tithe in the text . q decima vocatur ex decem alicujus rei portionibus una : one portion in any thing of ten , this is that which we call a tenth . Of what the priest receives this the quantum , the tithe ; no other it is than what they had who were of levies order , the dues of men that die , to him always they were and are alive . therefore , it is our part now to weigh them , just so , in no otherwise then at first appearance , as by Abraham into the hands of Melchizedec they were delivered : in the handling then after a two fold manner they are to be treated on . extensiuè quoad res ; intensiuè quoad personas . 

1.  extensiuè , in regard of the matter , or the diversity of severals , out of which they are to be taken ; so your tithes are {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . tithes of all : to him who in the text receives , Abraham as it is at the second verse , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , he gave a tenth part of all . Any thing of which yourself makes a gain , it is matter for a tenth ; all being good , nothing this way is to be refused ; but in respect of the specialties , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of all that ye possess , out of each your priest is to receive a tenth ; tithes in their latitude , being of all a tenth part : thus they are to be preached extensiuè : but beside this they are to be weighed . 

2.  intensiuè ; that is , they are to be treated on , as they respect the frame and disposition of his soul ; who , to him who receives is to pay tithes of all : thus the tenth it is r {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; the tenth of all , in each sort , it should be the best of all ; for so of old runs the reading at the fourth verse . cui & decimas dedit de praecipuis abraham patriarcha . s to whom the patriarch Abraham gave even the tenth of the chiefest : to translate it decimas spoliorum , as you have it , the tenth of the spoils ; is a construction too restrained : when {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} primarily in respect of chiefness , it hath reference to the quality of a thing , and for the sake of this , the quality doth import the matter , or subject . if then of spoils it be translated to the meaning of {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} it will come nearer , to render it t de praecipuis spoliorum ; a tenth of the best or chiefest of the spoils . this reading u unto the Greek church is not unknown ; and in the Latin {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} went ever for praecipua till the century that is last past . As then of all is to be received a tenth , so too , that tenth of all it should be the most especial . By Abraham what in tithes was rendered to Melchizedec , of all it was the primest ; all and of all the best it is that must be for tithes . Now thus stands the point touching the quantum : it is a tenth that doth determine the how much the priest receives ; concerning which was our second quaere : there is yet the third and the last which is 

Iii quare ; why he receives ? the reason why ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} it is witnessed that he liveth : therefore the priest receives tithes , because it is witnessed that he liveth . Of him here {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} the life , it is ratio proxima , the very reason or cause immediate , why these are now due : of tithes , this the why durative . under the gospel , the claim for these 't is still of force , in that the gospel to receive tithes , hath a priest that liveth : of this portion for the receipt , ye May see it in the text ; the very ground or warrant , it is from the perpetuity of the priest's life . therefore his dues ever tithes , he a priest ever being ; from his ever living , is the cause that tenths are never-dying . for , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . thus of these words the severals ; the quaere we begin with , is quis , who receives ? expressed in our text by the particle , is he , a priest receives . 

I. is he ; a priest receives . Now this priest no other wise in this quaere , ye are to behold him , than as Abraham's tithing sets him forth : not x qualis , such as he is quà priest , but quantus in his office how great he is , ye a•e to take notice of him : for this it is from his receiving at Abraham's hands in the fourth verse , saint Paul would have considered . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . consider , saith he there , how great this man was , in the text the he , unto whom the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the chiefest . that then for which tithes serve , it is of , 

priesthood to set out the greatness ; to signify unto us of how eminent a quality this holy function is , this it is for which at first tithes had their institution . y {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . It was for the honour of Melchizedec , that these dues Abraham paid . The finis ultimus then why tithes were ordained , it was to manifest of the priest the excellency ; to denote of how great digni•y he who receives , for this cause it is that they were appointed ; to point out unto us the priests {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; his prerogative to be very great . For tithes they are the medium by which our apostle proves , in the person of Melchizedec , of Christ's priesthood the sublimity ; in that Abraham who paid tithes , z hoc ipso in this very thing , he was made lower than Melchizedec , who received . what then in this part we must pursue , it is that for which tithes had their rise : in the beginning these they were assigned to discover unto us what high esteem is due unto priesthood ; yea even to that of Moses . for this was the ground , as from the fift verse a the learned do observe , why to Aaron the children of Jacob in this duty stood obliged ; when this portion which beneath Melchizedec , did argue Abraham , above any of the Hebrews , levies tribe they did praepose : as him , who received their tenths , with those of Israel , none so honourable ; though one with another persons and priest , all alike honourably descended ; yet with these the honour due to the office outstrips the honour had by the birth . b tanta enim erat sacerdotii •xcellentia , &c. say the fathers . even of levies priesthood the excellency it was so ample , that all of such a kind , it exalts them above all of the same kin : to Aaron's order , paying of tithes , their dignity , that it did surpass any of the race of Jacob it doth ascertain . But to let pass the legal priesthood ; to that of the gospel it is , that i must keep me ; and must tell you from the rendering of tithes , over all whomsoever of its priest the superexcellency ; this to be it which is inferred . For our Evangelical doctor saith . i•tuemini quantus sit hic . He who receives , consider how great he is to whom the patriarch Abraham gave &c.  mark well who gave . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , Abraham the patriarch ; this eminent Christian in the top of his dignity is set before you to usher in the greater dignity of the Christian priest ; it is the patriarch Abraham : c that is , Abraham the chiefest of fathers , the very first father ; princeps patrum Abrahamus . if literally the term patriarch be taken , than such a father he from whom all the fathers in Israel had their beginning : but if mystically and spiritually , than Abraham he is , d {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : the father of all them that believe : which of the two was the greater glory . now then , let the renown of Abraham , ne'er so much exceed , be his fame ne'er so flourishing ; 't is but that which the apostle would , that none among the Israel of God in glory should be so great as he : for in that one so glorious did tithe it to Melchizedec , how glorious then must Melchizedec be ? This is it which saint Paul would have considered : and too , he would have all hence to learn the lesson which Abraham tithing reads unto them ; which is this , that when 

tithes ye give of yourselves to your Melchizedec , it teacheth you the humbling ; that wherein it instructs you , 't is naught else than of yourselves , unto him in the lowly submission : for these they are the test of the awful reverence that to the priest is due ; in giving up of these as Abraham , so every man else , to his Melchizedec , he doth declare his subjection ; e {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : f signum subjectionis ; g testimonium erant reverentiae erga eum cui pendebantur . he still passeth a great deal for the better man , to whom h God's dues , his tenths they are delivered : of a whole persons the man most chief , tithes sets him below the priest ; the charge it warrants to be right high , to which of these the payment is referred : between man and man they put a difference , but the receiver , still they assure him to be the more worthy : that here which is inferred from the patriarchs paying of tithes , it is before himself of his priest the preferring : for 't is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . &c. confid . &c. it tells him that gives , that he is not like to him who takes for dignity , before any other , these tithes , they are the seals of the priest's promotion ; here above the patriarch they set Melchizedec . your rendering then of these to your priest ; they are the real the manifest profession of your submission . for of whom religion requi•es this fe•liy , over all such it shows its authority ; and learns them their own humbling , in this sort enjoining their obedience . i {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . this is an hard saying , i dare say to the most that hear it ; to hear that honour's due to an outcast priest , and that by tithes ; to you , to whom the very sound of priest is even ominous , is not this a theme that 's sour ? it exacts therefore the closer pressing . Know , then know , that the reverence had to those who are entrusted with the dispensing of sacred verities , tithes denotes it to be of a more del cate strain , than what 's born to other men ; though men to be admired for their condition , amiable for their graces , and for their piety even imirable of the priest himself ; yet of these with the priest , none to be compared . for as the patriarch among men , for dignity none so supreme ; yet to the he who receives , here he stoops and lets down his sail ; to Melchizedec , Abraham , be 〈◊〉 it in his glory ; in honour unto God before himself , he prefers his priest , and did publish to the world his own lowliness when he tithed it to Melchizedec . with a serious eye then of the gospel priest , weigh now the super-excellency : that Abraham , that he who for his glory of all his posterity was the most unmatchable ; that he , who for his worth had never any that could ever equal him : but all , at all times he did surpass : yet this man who did outstrip all ; that Melchizedec the he , who in the text receives , that the priest should surmount him ? {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . &c. consider how great this man is ; this he of how great perfection . k that besides many venerable respects that Abraham bore him , that to him too he should give tithes ; it was an argument more than prevailing , that of Melchizedec , the dignity it was non-pareil : of devouter Abraham this devouter act , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} by many , very many degrees , it puts him below God's priest , though a patriarch than any in Israel much more illustrious . This , of tithes the effect ; of their payment the issue , 't is to confirm how great a priest , the priest of the gospel : for Abraham to the he who receives , these argue him much unaequall Abraham for dignity to Melchizedec ; and make the patriarch too mean to come in balance with the priest ; since to this great man these they do subject Abraham : this deed preacheth aloud , that Melchizedec to this loyal saint he was superior ; and declares the good man obsequious to God's priest , though he triumphed it over Kings . thus Melchizedec the figure ; for all that was done , verily to him it was done who was the type , and did the service for him who indeed in the text receives . Now then , if Melchizedec for repute even to astonishment was so wondrous as that to his sheaf Abraham's must bow ? then Christ , the great high priest , Jesus Christ , how he ? if the semblance doth bear down all before it , than the substance what ? l {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} &c. if of command so powerful be the appearance ; then of the truth itself how glorious the royalty ; M its majesty how perspicuous ? to Jesus Christ , in what to him did Abraham stand bound ? in what ? verily by the current of our text in naught else but in that which he receives , that is , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , tithes ; that which Abraham owed here it is them , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : he receiveth them , tithes . The upshot then of that , which as hitherto hath been promiscuously delivered out of this first quaere ; distinctly it is but quis and quare . 

1.  quis , who receives ? in respect of service and assignment Melchizedec he receives ; but in regard of lordship and propriety , the he who receives is Christ ▪ for he is Lord of the soil , out of which these fruits are gathered ; of these his is the right original ; tithes in the primary claim they are his , who {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} is the priest ; to none but to him they appertain in their premier seizint his jus decimandi in the first tenure , by way of self-owning and title indubitate he receives tithes who is n the Christ , our Jesus . This the 〈◊〉 who will satisfy you , whensoe'er in this point ye put forth quis. but than 

2.  quare , it May be demanded for what cause at first this priest received tithes ? I have told you the cause why ; in the beginning it was no other , but of priesthood by the payment of these that the greatness Might be declared ; and so , this of tithes is the why institutive : of the priesthood of the gospel to set out the great honour which is due unto it , to this they are appointed ; unto Christ's yoke , the badges and tokens they are of his subjection , who soe'er pays : for this cause at first ordained , that at all times by these the persons Might witness what reverent abearance they owe unto their priest : over all from whom he receives his superiority they are to denote . And this of the first quaere , in its several branches is the sum : we proceed now to the second , which we proposed in the term . 

Ii quantum ; how much this priest received ? in the text definitely set down to be {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} tithes or tenths : so much by Abraham was given to Melchizedec . these tenths than they are to be treated on either , 

First in respect of the things offered ; and so Abraham's tithes , they were {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} tithes of all : or else , 

Secondly , in respect of the persons offering , and so the patriarchs tenth , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of whatsoever his tenth was , of the chiefest it was a tenth . Of these two , that which must first be set before you , it is that which shows how large a spread Abraham's tithing had ; to all it did extend . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} o he gave unto Melchizedec a tenth part of all ; which is the first part of our second quaere , touching the quantum , and comes now to be handled . 

1. {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : of each ones goods his part who lives , it is a tenth part of all : for this quantity of his priests , this the claim ; this Melchizedec did receive , this Abraham did impart , of all the tenth . 

Of any thing than you do possess , of this portion there is no exempting : with what ye are blessed no stinting of Christ , otherwise than he hath been pleased to stint himself . His command is p {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , ye ought to tithe all manner of herbs , q et omnium decimas . Of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee : of blessed Jacob this was the righteous vow . r {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . This of Jacob by no means the Christian let it pass : {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; but what he afore the law , under grace , it is ours to do as much : decimas omnium Jacob . and under the law , s 't is omnem proventum cement is tuae . Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year . and again , the Israelites upon the charge of King Hezekiah : t copiose decimas omnium . The tithe of all things brought they in abundantly . yea tithe of oxen.  't is too in the prophet . inferte omnem decimam . u bring ye all the tithe into the storehouse ; which could not be all the tithe , if not of all . thus precept as well as practice makes it good , that the tenth , his dues who receives , of whatsoever was to be tithed to be a renth ; implying Abraham's duty while to Melchizec ; ex omnibus , of all that religiously he Might , he paid tithes . for x 

{non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} of all , it is set down in the largest sense ; and so not to be confined by any particular . that then some would have all of these , and others all of those , of all to be the all ; this their opinion pass it doth with me for the instance of the patriarchs action , not for the restraint . it is not i that deny Abraham to have imparted of the spoils a tenth ; y the fathers say he did : nor yet is it i who dare gain say him to have tithed all z the goods that were his own : a when he who saith of all excludeth nothing . b decimas praeliorum , a tenth of the spoils that he got in battle that he did pay , i do believe it ; and too , decimat frugum , with the tithes of the fruits of the earth that were his , with these that he did present his priest , i am verily persuaded . If then any say , c that 

1.  Abraham gave these dues out of the spoils that he gained from Chedorlaomer and those other Kings against whom he raised the war ; that of all these as included the {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} should be meant , 't is confessed : for as our tithepayer jure belli d had a right to these , in that they were the peculium of the Assyrian Princes whom he vanquished ; so to the tithe of these in respect of him who gained them , Melchizedec also had a right , or if as it pleaseth e 

2.  others ; the spoils to be those which Abraham recovered from the conquered Kings , and were the very goods of Lot , and of the Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah ; such there are who say , these to be the all , of which he paid tithes . With these men so of all , these spoils Might go for one part , I 'd join hands : when {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} is large enough to comprehend these also . For consider , that albeit f Abrahams juravi elatâ manu meâ ad jehovam , &c.  that himself would take nothing of the King of Sodom ; yet his vow did not tie him , nor could it withhold him from giving to the priest of the most high God , that which belonged to him ; even the tenth part of all the spoils that were recovered . once more , be there g 

3.  others who put aside the spoils , and deliver the all to be abrahae facultates ; this with me of the all , as another 〈◊〉 all it will 〈◊〉 {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} belly , all this it will hold and 〈◊〉 , burst . That Abraham paid tither of all where : with himself was enriched , i gladly yield it , and of all that he gave , it was too of all that was his own : for if the patriarch did pay . tit be 〈◊〉 all the spoils ; shall we deny him to have discharged , this debt with the the of all that he had , out of his certain and standing possessions ? about what then our moderner tug , and to ; the exempting of all the rest , for such a specialty would conclude : go it May , not for the bound ; but for that which of the all May help to the making up . In brief of all that the patriarch gave , would you have the totull ? touching it , h what i have received , that i deliver to you : in all humble obedience to his priest he gave a tenth part of all ; that is , of all whatsoever be had ; of all the spoils that for himself of the enemy he gained ; the tithe of all the spoils of Sodom , and substance of Lot , which he brought backe and recovered ; of all that he carried out with him , and of all that he left at home ; even of all that any way he possessed . thus , his decim•• omnium without any the least violence offered to the text , to all tithe able stuff whatsoever that was within his power , it May be stretched . 

Well then , to make no hue and hue after any who hath stole from Abraham's {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : oneone-onely we 'll put forth a si quis . if then there be any manner of man , who cannot be induct to allow Abraham's piety of his goods to be so lavish ; but that it stood better with his wiser thrift to have offered once , and no more , to his priest a tenth of the spoils , out of that so renowned a victory ; if there be any such that can be found ? such a foundling , for my part let him have his will : for once to the theology that is municipal we 'll endeavour meekly to subscribe ; that only of the spoils , and of nothing else , but of these only , a tenth part was only imparted : as by the monk of the order of Cleroborus it hath been only said , so be it ; that what Abraham gave was of only spoils , merely spoils : if only so , what then follows ? In so saying , this divine solus , he did not prejudice the priests right , but only of the patriarch , from the well-known zeal he doth detract : he only delivers to the world Abraham to godward , to have been piteously penurious ; that of his dues to religion he was a niggardly micher , that he was an Abraham clunchfisted ; and all that this way went , he thought it only •aste ; that the good child Judas that he did , he did learn of his father Abraham , i quorsum perditiohaec ? not at all from Melchizedec he doth withdraw . For once then , in this pinching sparing , scraping wise , let it be admitted ; that Abraham gave a renth of nothing but only of the spoils , which at such a time he got at such a battle : but withal then let it be admitted what saint Chrysostom hath left ; for indeed he says k {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : and we say so too : if you will , let the father say , that only with the spoils : for , doth he not say in that famous homily de autolico made to the legists of Praedonia ; there , doth he not say there that Abraham was the first who put in practice modus decimandi ? be it so then , that saint Chrysostom says that only with the spoils , which Abraham brought backe , he gratified Melchizedec , but then of this holy father the {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} we would have you to take home unto you : for saith he {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , by his giving a tenth of the spoils ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; hence , to all Abraham is made a teacher ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . This Abraham in giving a tenth of the spoils , preacheth unto us , that as he , so each man else should give unto God , the first favites of what he gives unto him . {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , &c. of all which he did bring backe a tenth he severed for Melchizedec : hence to all Abraham is made a teacher ; now to no more we urge you , than from Abraham's deed , saint Chrysostom enjoins : be it a tenth part only of the spoils that he got ; we press you to no more , than only to the rendering of a tenth part of that you get . thus the payment from the spoils , Melchizedec's dues it doth no way impeach ; for unto him as to each priest else , there was no more due than the tenth of all that did anew come in : of your latest incre•se , so much that ye should contribute , from Abraham's fact this it is of the golden-mouthed Greek that is required . And therefore now to proceed , your 

duty , suit it should with his practice ; of all that you get bound it is to the giving up of a tenth part . for l decimas nostras annis singulis decunctis frugibus , pecoribus praecipit erogand•s dominus . Of all fruits , of all cattle , each year the Lord commands a tenth to be given out . And M de omni substantia quam deus homini donat decimam partem sibi servavit , for himself God keeps the tenth of all the substance which he gives to men . n if we have sown unto you , saith the apostle , spiritual things , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ? {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , your carnal things . o super hoc debitum , upon this debt of returning things carnal for receiving things spiritual , saith Aquinas , doth the church ground its determination for the paying of tithes . omnia quae homo possidet , all that a man hath sub carnalibus continentur , under carnal things it is contained : and therefore de omnibus possessis , it is inference , of all that a man hath , he must pay tithes . de p fructibus & quasi fructibus omnium •erum quae quodam modo nobis sunt frugiferae : of fruits and of each thing fruit-like , that bringeth in increase ; omniumquè negotiorum lucrosorum : unto your priest , the manifest of your subjection it must be from all your affairs , whence ye have your gain . q {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . Out of the very fruits of his very labours these dues Abraham raised for his Melchizedec . r neque est ratio : neither is there any reason since all that is yours , comes under things carnell , why of some of these you should pay tithes , and not of others . of the trade then that any of you drive , thence it is to your priest in this matter that your obedience ye must make good ; of each one from each thing righteously got , thence heavens quota pars . with Abraham he gives not tithes of all , who is conscious of any one thing to the keeping backe . Therefore , s si decimas non habes fructuum terrenorum quod habet agricola . if of fruits of the earth ye hand tithes as the husbandman ; yet quod cunque te pascit ingenium , whatsoever craft sustains thee , inde decimas expetit , unde vivis ; our tenths are to be demanded whence ye live : courtship , camp , or bar ; shop or plow ; all in these are alike engaged . t be then thy gains from the earth , that is thy possession , or from the very labours of thy very person ; if of thy pains thou findest the fruits , thence with a tenth Melchizedec must be served ; in these matters of your travail tithes follows the success ; nor of what sort of calling the tithepayer be , so a lawful , upon that religion does not stand , but to all that a man gets its dues it doth extend : for as of Abraham , so of each man else that which he hath obtained , it is titheable : even those minutula , things which in themselves are little worth , and seem of no account ; as rue , anise , cumin , yet of these for tithe no omission , u these ye ought not to leave undone . for though in his x singula , of these each several May seem of little or no moment , yet omnium cumulus , in their heap and sail , they May amount to much : now that cannot but stead the priest which to the owner is advantageous . it is a tenth then , and a tenth of all that is sub manu , which of the priest is the portion . y let him that is taught in the word , saith the apostle , communicate to him that reacheth in all good things . here is a text for you of London : men much addicted to him that teacheth , but nothing to the priest , to Melchizedec ; for you then ; what we hear of you it is no good report ; in the business that we are now about , it is too well known that ye deal double . therefore ( In the behalf of the curates of London , to keep close to that taking device of the incomparable Selden , and withal to bring you to your duty ) that he who teacheth May be provided for of sufficient living : we advise you that ye do not deceive , and yourselves be not deceived , for God is not mocked . for him then whom ye would have , your teacher ; what for him that teacheth , ye are commanded to set aside , somewhat it is , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in all good things . now as a z right reverend of our own hath it , this all of saint Paul , in all good things ; no other it doth insinuate , than the all of which we have hitherto treated ; naught else but Abraham's all : it would that you of the city , as well as those of the country should impart to him that teacheth in all good things , one part in ten . for attend ; as Christ in our text must be honoured , so are ye to communicate ; now the tenth is that which he receives , and the tenth is that which ye of London ought to give . for otherwise than the priest takes in all good things , should we allow ye to contribute . we should make saint Paul to the Galatians thwart and clash with saint Paul to the Hebrews : but , my beloved Londoners , no such matter ; since the text that 's loose , is to be bound by the text that 's strict : what then in one place in all good things , he leaves unlimited , that is to take quantity from the place that doth determine ; the scripture tithed , is to be the rule to the scripture which is unti•hed : and so , the part in our text Christ's right being a tenth ; it remains in the behalf of him ; as Abraham , so ye citizens to him that teacheth , ye should ensure your subjection in all good things of a tenth , by the communicating . Of tithes touching the extent thus stands the case : {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in each kind it ought to be a tenth part of all coming in . But here we rest not ; all is not all , unless as Abraham's all it be de praecipuis , of all the most chief . Abraham's all , which for the quantity was the tenth ; that too for the quality of all , it was the most principal . 

Ii {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; the tenth of all than any of the other nine parts , was m•ch were choice : for this term {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , a the apostle useth to extend it to all ordinary tithes of increase ; b and unto that eternal duty of paying tithes it will fetch in the best and principal of men's possessions . Hence than we urge ; each one of this duty while he is in the performance , of each parcel that he offers unto a diligent survey : in these matters not to deal with God hand over head ; but as for himself in every thing he would that which is most singular , so in point of tithe to be as studious ; not to set apart that for him who receives with which himself can not away ; to the priest no offering of that , which so it be gone , we care not much who hath it . Such dealings as these they ne'er stood with the fidelity of Abraham . God who c found his heart faithful before him , for the choiceness of that wherewith he ministered to his priest , no doubt but he found him very solicitous ; to give that which did more excel right industrious . he who loved so much what was of little or no value for his priest , a meet present he could ne'er think it : but what in honour to his Melchizedec he did perform , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} no other from Abraham could proceed than of the chiefest even a tenth . ye May then believe me , to pay his saviour with his trash to his believing soul it was abhorrent ; nay rather , his tenths though ne'er so precious , of what they should in his own esteem , did they not fail ? Indeed , to give tithes of any thing , no matter what , so it be a tenth ; it denotes a fear had to him who doth command , but of the son not the fear : the sonlike fear , if this way a work ; for the sort 't is dainty , it severs , and culls , and picks , and weighs , and chooseth that which is most pleasing for him who hath its reverence , its love puts its god before itself in each part of its substance . as then in all moral duties it fares with each agent , so with him who tithes it . d {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . Tithing aright hath a strong and most especial regard to the mind and purpose of him that offers ; that he do it out of a willing and ready disposition , with all strength of affection : which near so well appears as when his subjection to him that lives savours of all his soul ; as when his tenths shows that for his redeemer , he thinks nothing too good ; when the tenth of every thing is better than that which he reserves for himself ; and his own profit is put behind his dues to religion ; not aught more worth , and that no present for the priest : in a word , when a man gives a bare tenth , he gives of his goods , but he gives himself whom his tenth gives up the best . now whosoe'er doth thus , doth no more than to what he stands bound . e out of all your gifts , optima & electa cuncta ; ye shall offer , saith the text , of all the best thereof . f righteous Abel , ex primogenitis & pinguissimis ; unto the Lord he-brought the firstlings of his flock , and of the fat thereof . on this offering of Abel's , will ye hear saint Chrysostom to descant ? thus than he g {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : unto the Lord merely oh his sheep Abel did not bring : but what ? {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of the first of his flock , he ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} that is , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of those that were prizeworthy , of the delicate ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : and after that out of those firstlings which were choice , again did Abel select the choicer . now did Abraham in his oblation come behind the pious Abel ? Non h devilioribus , he , sed de praecipuis ac melioribus dedit ei decimas . to give unto Melchizedec the refuse of his store , it ne'er stood with Abraham's piety . He , whose Lord had long afore his heart , in his tenths unto him he could ne'er be heartless ; but what he paid with a deal of care he did all ; not set apart he , and of what not fore think ; but what was of most esteem he did first discern , and then let it go ; with a busy eye be overlooked all ; but naught his priest he did assign , but what for worth the rest did overtop . Abraham's tenths , they were {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , the richest of the spoils , the most liking of his cattle , the purest of his gold , of his silver the most refined . for i Abraham , as the letter hath it , was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold . touching the matter then of this present duty how much it is ? that it is decima a tenth ; and too , a tenth of all , ye are not ignorant : but as for the manner , how good it must be ? the apostle tells you that it must be {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , the prime , something more surpassing in that kind any of the rest ; this at least it must be : but whether ? to put that to the question which indeed is out of question . As it is then , 

whether nothing so good ? of all whether it should be the best ; look you to that ? such as is your offering , such is your devotion ; if ye fail not of so much as you are commanded , for you give a tenth ; yet render not so good as ye are able : k {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ; with all the heart , as ye should , do ye love the Lord your God ? If in what ye tithe , ye give Christ what is good , yet in that kind keep backe somewhat that is better , above all , is Christ then , is he preferred before all ? l cui meliora , ille melior . that 's better than God , for which is reserved a better thing ; and while of your estates ye return him the common stuff , no affection it denotes but what 's common ; slightly served he , and as slightly prized . in your tithes then the choiceness of what you bring ; what reverence ye bare him who receives , hence is the lively evidence : in religion cold and frozen , nay dead is that soul , which could set out his gleanings , and withdraw his sheaves ; make show of the gudgeon , but to convey away the salmon ; that he Might gainsay his timber would flatter you with the chips ; when he should pay the pearl , doth very frankly set down the pebble . but not so Abraham , of what he made up his tenths , of that he was curious for the kind ; God was first in his soul , and too first in his possessions ; still the best that a man hath , it is for his service , who hath the best of a man . naught too dear for God , if once in our better part , we are endeared to him : tithes than cannot but be de praecipuis , unless in ourselves the high priest be end praecipuus . thus did Abraham , and ye must no otherwise : his tenths they were of all , and of all the most choice ; your duty of no other stamp ; of your increase the tenth of all in each several , and in each of all no other than the chiefest . of •i•hess this the condition , when Abraham tithed it to Melchizedec ; so much they were , and in such a manner to be delivered up : and in this matter at this day no change : for the old honorary , the old claim , since no priest now , but the priest of old ; when your priest than Abraham's priest he is no other . M Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever : it was gospel then , it is gospel now , therefore the same tithes , since the very self same priest ; there being no other priest , there needs no honour of a new edition : so that your duty 's not a whit altered ; his dignity being full as fresh , he as great as he was before . to him then even in these times by tithes the same subjection holds firm ; in that in office he the same continues : that , which unto us and all that come after us brings down the why institutive ; it is of tithes the why durative : for the awful reverence , which by this tribute Abraham showed to the greatness of the priest ; why at this day it must be observed , it is at this day of the priest from the endurance . in the very way then of Abraham's payment , we come now to the reason for which tithes are to be continue ; for touching your duty , wherefore in conscience to render these ye are obliged , and that we have authority upon the peril of your souls to command the fulfilling ; in the text the ground , of the priest is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : of your obeying and our enjoining , the life it is the warrant ; for , he who receiveth tithes , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} of him it is witnessed that he liveth : of the priest the life , why tithes are now due it is the quare ; and of the three quaeres as the last proposed comes to be considered {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , that he l•veth . 

Iii , on {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . helives , and he lives a priest , for under n this notion it is , that we are to present him to you ; and in the kind you wot of , why Abraham's duty to Abraham's children it should descend ; the grand quaere is ; not in that simply believes ; but because he always lives a priest . What then is of notice most especial , why tithes still are your debt ; of his life it is the diversity of consideration : which is to be set before you either primitiuè or dispensatiuè . 

First primitive , ye are to behold it , as Christ , he who lives for your eternal profit , puts it into action ; and so , this his life , being unto you the life of a priest ; hence it is that in the first rise unto him , from you tithes are due ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in that for you he liveth now a priest . 

Secondly , this his life is to be weighed dispensatiuè ; as the Melchizedec's here below have the managing of it , to discover what precious fruits do accrue unto you from this his life ; it being a life for your spiritual good , wholly behooveful : and this is the quare why of the gospel the now priests , they of tithes are among you made the receivers ; it is because the word which they bring , it is the o word of life : for thus , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . &c. of him it is witnessed that in them he liveth . what then in the first place warrants unto him Abraham's performance to be your service , it is in that 

1.  primitiuè and in se , in his own personliely l•ves a priest : and no mean motive this from all Christians for the pleaded-for subjection , if but duly thought on : when this priest , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in that he lives ; it is to pray , and p for the transgressors to make intercession . q if any man hath sinned , saith saint John , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , we have an advocate with the father , Jesus Christ the righteous . For , r who is this but he who hath engaged his heart to approach unto the Lord ? in respect then of him for the abidance of tithes , this the quare : in that in himself a priest he lives ; even now to be our spokesman , to plead , and sue out our pardon , to reconcile and set us at one with him , whom our sins hath set at odds . s {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : it is for us that he is at this present , the merciful and faithful high priest , in things pertaining to God : when none of us without this life that dares deal above ; that can go to God , and yet go without Christ ; who is it that can appear an offender before his judge , and not provided of a satisfaction ? would a release of his bonds , and neglect the life that paid the ransom ; stands in need of mercy , and yet t for the Lord's sake does not petition it ? Behold then the life i set before you this day , and of the priest's claim , yield to the justice ; hence in Abraham's way , ought ye not to apply yourselves to Abraham's subjection ? for as to Abraham , so to you he lives a priest ; this his life in your behalf he wholly employs it ; where he is , the managing of your affairs altogether takes him up : on {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} that he liveth , as a good priest should he abides our suitor , and that thither we May come whether he hath ascended , for this he lives to request the father . prayers than he doth offer up , and in u this a priest : but this is not all at which we are to look ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , that he liveth and intercedes ; but too , the sacrifice , we must regard , x which he did once when he offered up himself : since this also in se , as in himself he is a priest , it is to be considered . That then y for our transgressions he was wounded , and bruised for our iniquities ; as ever , so now , z this is that which makes him a powerful orator : when from the redemption that he wrought , is the life of his intercession ; the strength of his interpleading , it is from the dignity of his merit ; from his passion , of his prayers , is the prevalency . So then , for the point in hand , ye see upon what warrant we ground the urging ; this homage of yours what now commands ; but that in which consists your bliss eternal ? from that which of the gospel is the very pith ; ab evangelii evangelio , from the life of a saviour , hence the now quare : his priestly being is the why at your hands this service why now he must receive ; from a perpetual benefit , it is that the bond is perpetual when for us it is inse , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , that a priest be liveth in himself : for our sakes , it is that the deity is still solicited ; to appease the wrath that we have provoked , this the cause that before justice eye his precious sufferings are still set ; that the remembrance of his forepast chastisement this priest renews , 't is to effect our peace ; and now powers out the desires of his soul for that only which we all desire . Yet further ; that which adds to the worth of this his executing his priestly office ; and so , unto you makes the enforcement the more strong ; it is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} that now he lives a priest enthroned : for , a {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : into heaven itself he is entered now to appear in the presence of God for us . therefore , all his doings ye are so to construe them , as of his infinite glory they suit with the present condition : weighwell ye should of the now priest , the now state ; an all-glorious life it is of an all glorious priest . Christ's then b pro humanâ naturâ rogasse ; at this day his mediating for us , no other it is than in the stateliness of his divinity his taking to him our nature ; and thus , in his own person having assumed it , in our behalf what he will he obtains of this by the presenting ; all things then to him are granted , not from the submissness of his desire , but upon the knowledge of his desert ; as a suppliant he does not now crave , but as a conqueror he procures . what i say ye May believe , when c we have such an high priest , who is set , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens . to his claim then unto the debt we preach for , ought ye not to have regard ? when this priest though he liveth so d highly exalted ; yet in naught fallen from his office ; but the priest's work , it is still his e non otiosum gerit christus sacerdotium : from the business due to the priesthood , though he be in heaven he is not discharged ; but for your heal it is that even there , he abides a priest all-sufficient : since , f he is able to save , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , to the uttermost them that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them . The remission then of your sins ; unto a better hope , the acceptance of your persons ; for your time of being here , your priest's plighting of his word for your upright abearing ; upon his own back his taking of your load ; his fulfilling whatsoever you fail in ; of his now being the now majesty : in a word , all that the gospel reveals touching this priest , all serves but to make the continuing quare the more weighty ; that ye May be the more easily induced by •ithess to evidence your submission . thus , to the sons he that lives being the same priest that he was to the father , Abraham's dues , that they should be your debt is it any more than right ? g christus Jesus Catholicus pa•ris sacerdos . he being of his father the Catholic priest , is there any reason that he should be denied a * Catholic subjection ? according to that he receives , of all is it not necessary that there be rendered to him one and the same obedience ? since as for Abraham so for all , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : of him it is witnessed that a priest he liveth : from him quà priest , there flowing an universal good , unto him ought there not to be returned a duty universal ? of tithes for the permanency in this manner stands the quare , in regard now of the right primitive : in se , he who receives , as he is in himself if beheld ; ye find unto you {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , that he liveth still a priest : and therefore for this cause it is by tithes your allegiance unto him ye ought to make apparent . but yet , in the spring head and ascent upmost , though his they are : yet as he lives otherwise , than in himself a priest , so too , for the lasting of tithes , an other sort of right , his life it doth produce , a right derivative ; when 

2.  dispensativè ; in a second way we told you , that in those he lives to whom of this his life he hath committed the dispensing . thus we are fallen upon the point wherein we are to discover how to tithes the now priests of the gospel they lay claim : when tithes not only primarily as they are owned ; but too , secundarily they are to be treated on as they are assigned : indeed it is in heaven that the receipt is ratified , though the payment ne'er were but upon the earth ; ye give here to the hand , what 's there due to the body . now then , to come to those to whom tithes sub evangelio are to be delivered : of these touching the endurance to handle the quare as it concerns us . the reason why also tithes are our dues , for these in a surer way we cannot lay the ground , than in the text upon the {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : since to the now Melchizedec's , of the priest , of Christ here {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of all their labors it is the life : that which makes us bring h glad tidings of good things unto you , is it not in that with this life we come fraught ? for i {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : of life unto life we are the savour ; and our now charge k it is to stand and speak to the persons {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} : all the words of this life . Hence than it is that we receive tithes , since of his life , the saving benefits effectually to impart we are enabled : for their work sake here below to the Melchisedec's , of the gospel the now priests , l whose it is {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , to them this honour , hence it is that they have it warranted ; the priest lives in them to communicate his life ; and of his living priesthood these sacred annexa in them he receives . but that we May take the whole scripture which concerns this matter along with us ; it doth well be seem us in the old way to set our footing : and so , it is our duty to set before you of Melchizedec and of Aaron the quare ; that from their why for ou•constant receipt of tithes , we also May fetch our why : which May so be done , and yet of the priest from the life we not all together turn aside . What then first of 

1.  Melchizedec was the quare ; that which was the reason wherefore of this standing tribute , he was deigned the honour ; the cause was a benedicendo : from the blessing , which on Abraham he did confer . Melchizedec M blessed him saith the text , to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all . now then , mark ; if Melchizedec of the patriarch upon his n blessing did receive tithes ? in his way in the behalf of us for the same debt is there not the same cause ? since as he to Abraham , so we to all that are of Abraham do impart the blessing ; o even the blessing of the most high God possessor of heaven and earth . this blessing we dispense ; which is no other in the richness of it , than the life of him , of whom in the text it is witnessed , &c.  for the quare then , why unto us of Melchizedec tithes the endurance ; there being from us naught now but the same blessing , what should be to us , if not the same subjection ? when whose at this day is the very office , is not theirs too , the very rights , tithes ? for Melchizedec blessed , and p eo nomine , of a tenth part of all he was made partaker . To the same purpose then that by Abraham these dues were given to his priest ; the same end in your rendering of tithes it ought to be observed : now to him the tenth it was assigned to set out how great a priest he was . and for our parts , since we are to you , q {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . in stead of him that liveth ; and naught do , but r {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , in the person of Christ what we do ; and if anywhere received , s as Jesus Christ we are to be received ; and since , t servatores sumus , we are the saviour's that come up on mount Zion : this being considered ; as tithes did from Abraham to Melchizedec , so from you being paid ; are they not to demonstrate of our callings excellency , your dreading approvement ? in respect then of each particular duty , our high function enjoins , these are to ensure your obedience unto us , who have u the rule over you . to this tithes serve , that to the world they May declare , what great men they are , who now are evangelical priests ; in that the honour which for himself Priest-christ commands , to us he vouchsafes , his tenths , in token then of your submission to our authority , of all increase , of all your substance the best in tithes is to be imparted : when Melchisedec's superiority doth follow the charge of Melchizedec ; the life which in the blessing of Melchizedec , was the very cream , the life of the priest , this is the blessing we bring : with the bread and with the wine ; with the body and with the blood : with an {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , and a {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , we come . From Melchizodec then unto us for the continuance of tithes we infer the quar• : being enjoined his task , this the why in dis 

even so hath the Lord ordained that they should live who preach the gospel . e {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . In matter of maintenance the apostle does not bring in , any new , strange , unheard of thing , he innovates nothing at all ; with a new egg of his own addling he does not present the Corinthians : but the old practice upon former precept to be continue that it is ordained this he preacheth . The power that he had f to eat and to drink , it was {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , even so , as that of levies , who g to take tithes had a commandment . touching those then who sub evangelio officiate for him , of whom it is witnessed that &c.  Aaron's portion why their pay ye have the quare ; the stile of the now law warrants it to be according to the law afore ; {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} to be no other than even so . thus look which way you please ; to the subjection due to Melchizedec , or to the maintenance owed to Aaron ; to hoc fac , or to crede hoc ; to the h law of faith , or to the law of works ; to the rule by which ye are justified , or to the line by which ye are sanctify ; of these take which ye will ; and of the priest's life the now dispensers , of these rents how they authorised to be the takers up , ye will easily discern . Or , if either of these pleas the now priests should let go ; yet in the text a hold they have impregnable ; when out of all danger of assault is : {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , of the priest the life : of a right then unto these dues , i {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , those who unto you are the stewards of the mysteries of God ; of a title unto tenths , these they can ne'er fail , unless our text fail : keep then to this , and keep up tithes : when this assures you of an {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there , where tithes are ever to be received ; for {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} there , in the priesthood of the gospel , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth . and here , to our discourse a period it Might be put ; but that other things are yet behind needful to be observed , as first , 

1.  All this while , by the text what 's received , and what 's paid , it is but tithes , than a tenth , 't is no more . therefore , as if this portion were too exceeding ; or that , in the requiring of these we went beyond our commission , that ye May not repine , or what we write with a head hung down entertain : we are further to acquaint you , and as the troth is deliver it ; that to the 

Now priests of the gospel , k tithes to be the least of that which justly they May claim ; but a very pittance of that greater sum in which ye all stand engaged . Indeed if we look at scriptum est , and jus strictum in respect of a part determined ; than a mere , a bare tenth , no more can be challenged : but if the worth of that we bring were it possible to value it ; how little then of that great deal ye owe would a tenth prov ? for consider , thus much , tithes , the Christians gave who were afore the law ; and those who were under the law paid tithes , all which had the priest that lives in a promise only , and in a figure ; so much as this they imparted , and all upon the belief that he was to come : now that he is come , and l in giving of himself hath freely given all things unto us : to be returned than the wont tenth whether there be no more ? judge ye . In this matter to yourselves i do appeal : does not nature teach , that the better ye are used , the deeper ye are obliged ; and such as is the fare , such should be the pay ; and that a more abounding crop , should follow a more plenteous sowing ; and that we should receive in , according to that we have laid out ? bethink yourselves ; in the breast within , have ye not a thing that to this bears witness ? But to keep to scripture : for the legal priests then , if first fruits and tithes , and what not were due to those , whose M service stood in ordinances that were carnal ; and all that they did , tended no further than n {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , to the purifying of the flesh ? if of such the ministry had so ample an endowment ? then to him o whose blood from dead works is able to purge the conscience , that ye May serve the living God : to him , i say , in his now priests , can a tenth be a tax so intolerable ? p {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . If under the old testament such doings there were as these , then much more should there not be under the new ? This quantity of levies order , to set out the excellenty it was appointed , whose work was but the q ministration of death ; and to those of our rule , whose is the ministration of the spirit , to us than a tenth shall there be due no more ? our priesthood then as it is r natura praestantius , dignitate eminentius , ita usu fructuosius . as in its nature that of Aaron's it doth far surmount , and in its exercise being far more fruitful , and in that we of the gospel come loaded to our persons with better commodities , and far more precious than those of the law : this being so , in your offering to us , your reverence how should it exceed that of Israel ; how outstrip that ? quis pudor est christianos qui debent majora , non solvere paria ? oh the fhame ! that Christians who owe more , should ne'er be found to return so much . what shall we say ? Did not the scribes and Pharisees pay tithes of all that they possessed ? Now s except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharises : — from what follows God defend ; but except your righteousness , &c. {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven . deceive not yourselves ; of these miscreants the righteousness how doth yours t exceed ? if in that ye are ever peccant wherein they were never guilty ? u qnomodo superabis eum , cui non aequaris ? in this duty if these ye do not equal , that ye go beyond such when will be the time that it May be found ? of the scribes and Pharises ye are yet to learn ; these though too bad , yet to teach you truly to 〈◊〉 it wondrous and sufficient : of your profession is not this the blot ; that to scribes and Pharises ye should be to go to school ? now then , if it be tithe , and more than a tithe to which the now priests have now right , 

2.  what warrant then for that unwarrantable competency that everywhere is in practice ? or what conscience will allow you to abide by a mouldy custom fetched from time out of mind ? or for your teacher to think that right meet which comes from the raw discretion of an upstart vestry ? or what ground is there for a x be unto me a father and a priest , and i will give unto thee ten shekels of silver by the year , &c.  y have not our fathers eaten sour grapes ; and the children's teeth are they not set on edge ? as if the now priests were the accursed progeny of unhappy eli.  z do they not come and crouch for a piece of silver ? and for their putting into one of the priests offices ; for the most part is it not the end , ut panis frustum , that they May eat a piece of bread ? when tithes which were ever due , they are now nowhere paid . 't is in the text a priest & tithes ; of the blessing upon Abraham's receiving , of these is Abraham's rendering . to the goodwill then of the many no referring of the priest for that which must sustain him ; and upon the hearing of the man , no giving accordingly as you like him ; and amend his pay , thereafter as he mends his preaching ; for if in your wifedomes he chance to improve his talant , perhaps he shall be considered for it : or if for his bigger preferment he can hire out himself for more , then to truck it with him for his longer tarriance : as if , he who lives should not all this while receive tithes ? or for those who of his gospel are the setters forth he had no way provided ; only their allowance he hath so left it , that nothing's theirs but what it pleaseth you to give . Now is this the honour that ye do your priest ? a thirty pieces of silver , a goodly price that i was prized at of them : ye know full well of whom 't is said . In the name of God then , from the beginning of the world to this present time , and ever after ; from the bond of tithes have ye had a general acquittance ? that concerning the worship due unto your priest , ye are so sapinely negligent ? it is witnessed that he liveth ? and here on earth must he be so abased ; that those who negotiate for him must stand to your good liking for what they have ? naught receive , but what wherewith to part ye think fit ? was this the awful regard that Abraham bore to his Melchizedec ? that ye should handle your b instructors in Christ , as ye do those who have the charge of your bounds ? the man now in the stable , and him in the church between one and other is there any difference ? for what must keep them , both alike do they not rely only upon that which your own inventions have imagined behooveful ? the kitchen and the pulpit do they not work as you and they , thereafter as ye have agreed ? As if tithes had nothing to do with conscience ; nor God ere call to a reckoning , of this sacred revenue for the vile unhallowing . so long then as ye hear of a tenth , and of one who lives tithes to receive , so long as ye have tidings ; so long know it is not left to you to dispose of the priesthoods dues according as you last : but that it is yours first to quit you of your debt , and then to talk of your gratuity ; till ye have performed your bounden duty , let alone your benevolence : if what ye owe , ye fail to pay , with a largesse of the n'one coming to d' of God , ne'er dream ; ne'er build upon a piece of self-willed charity , till in what justice would ye have satisfied your priest , in his tithes . indeed a freewill offering it May not be denied , that to the now priests it is due : and over and above your tenths that much more ye owe , we grant it to you : for , except your righteousness exceed , &c.  we confess too , that the overplus which to render ye are enjoined , in respect of a fixed , a set part , in this ye are left to your own liberty ; as a tenth ; so more than a tenth is necessary upon precept ; but than a tenth how much more ye ought to give ? In regard of you this is the matter only arbitrary ; to your own power , ye are to be refered to define of that which must exceed ; free in this ye are at your own choice for the muchity to offer to your priest . Seriously but weigh this , and will ye not find it damnable and deadly to your souls ; when to the prejudice of tithes , to carve as ye list to your Melchizedec ye ne'er fear to presume ? for while by contributing less than a tenth , of your debt ye fancy the discharging : what do ye but run more upon the score , and make your burden the more grievous ? in diminishing the sum , ye add to your disobedience ; and eternally undo yourselves in impoverishing the priest . To draw to an end ; on your parts , what then remains now , but to the 

3.  priest , c ut honorem debitum deferatis ? naught but of your faithful service this humble tender ; that in paying of tithes , as tithes require ye make good your subjection ; it is true , with a great deal of goods ye must part ; but too ye must do it with a great deal of submission : because ye enrich the man , by no means yourselves exalt . the priest fares well , and indeed must : d yet for the fleece never a whit beholding to the sheep ; because of the parish sustained , he is not therefore brought under of the means ye have it is that he lives , but not of you ; at the people's hands it is that he doth receive , yet on the persons it is not that he doth depend ; but only thence his livelihood , whence his office . e {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . For the work of the gospel it is that he is appointed ; and too , not of those he teacheth , but that he live of the gospel it is ordained . f ipsa naturalis ratio hoc habet , ut quis inde vivat ubi laborat . this of nature 't is the dictate , that of each one thence be the support , whence is the ground of his employment . ye give then , and ye give to him ; yet what he receives , 't is that which of you the gospel claims ; the duty which ye owe him , 't is for the service which he doth it . hence of the priest your obeying ; by your substance his subsisting doth not make you his good Masters ; but in what he takes , in that ye declare yourselves debtors . in the behalf then of the priest that ye are put to charges . non g est mendicitas , sed potestas . in this ye relieve not his penury , but bear witness to his authority ; in so doing , ye do not help his wants , but yield to his power . it would be his sin then to crave , that which of right he May command ; and in you a foul fauli to expect his asking , when 't is your duty to deliver up . For so long as your tithes ye do with hold , so long of your priest from the dignity ye do withdraw ; ye lessen his reverence , in denying his maintenance ; and make him little , in keeping from him tithes which should make him great ; while ye defraud him of his portion , ye avile his function ; ye h rob and steal from God , in depriving him of his goods . it is high time then to betake you to your charge , and of this debt in the performance , as it would thereafter to demean yourselves : ever remembering that this way while ye advance your religion , your obedience thereunto ye do but anew testify , and that all is for the honour of your priest , when this part ye do so devoutly dedicate ; to make apparent his praeeminence over you , to this it is that tithes they were allotted : for that which made Melchizedez greater than Abraham , was it not tithes ? To shut up all : i only exhort you of these to the payment ; ye have a priest who lives to receive , and whom May ye better follow than him whom ye have for your father . Abraham , he paid tithes of all , and the best of all in honour to his Melchizedec : now , i if ye were Abraham's children , ye would do the works of Abraham : what he performed that of you it is required . Therefore , k quicunque recognoscit in se quod fidellter non dederit decimas suas . this of saint Ambrose 't is wholesome counsel . Whosoever among you doth acknowledge that in matter of tithe he ne'er dealt faithfully : modo emendet quod minus fecit : now , let him now amend that of which afore he fell so short . quid est fideliter dare decimas : to give tithes faithfully wherein doth it consist ? nisi ut , nec minus nec pejus aliquando deo offerat . but that to God of whatsoever ye have , ye offer neither worse nor less . Abrahami actio , est nostra institutio , Abraham's action , 't is our instruction .
