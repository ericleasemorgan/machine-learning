To my worthily honoured friend , Sir w. s. knight . 

Sir , 

I have many thanks to give you for the book you pleased to send me , called the popish royal favourite ; and according to your advice ( Which i value in a high degree ) i put pen to paper , and something you May see i have done ( Though in a poor pamphleting way ) to clear myself of those aspersions that are cast upon me therein . But truly Sir , i was never so unfit for such a task ; all my papers , manuscripts , and notes , having been long since seized upon and kept from me . Add hereunto , that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three months close restraint ( The sense whereof , i find hath much stupefied my spirits ) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sickness , a high burning fever , with the new disease , whereof my body as well as my mind , is yet somewhat crazy : so that ( Take all afflictions together ) i May truly say , i have passed the ordeal , the fiery trial . But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better days i hope ; for out of this fatal black cloud , which now oresets this poor island , i hope there will break a glorious sunshine of peace and firm happiness : to effect which , had i a jury , a grand-jury of lives , i would sacrifice them all , and triumph in the oblation . 

So i most affectionately kiss your hands , and rest 

Your faithful ( Though afflicted ) servant , from the prison of the fleet . J. h.  

The preeminence of parliament . 

Sectio prima . 

I am a freeborn subject of the realm of England ; whereby i claim as my native inheritance , an undoubted right , propriety , and portion in the laws of the land : and this distinguisheth me from a slave . i claim also an interest and common right in the high national court of parliament , and in the power , the privileges and jurisdiction thereof , which i put in equal balance with the laws , in regard it is the fountain whence they spring : and this i hold also to be a principal part of my birthright ; which great council i honour , respect , value , and love in as high a degree as can be ; as being the bulwark of our liberties , the main boundary and bank which keep us from slavery , from the inundations of tyrannical rule , and unbounded will-government . and i hold myself obliged in a tie of indispensable obedience to conform and submit myself to whatsoever shall be transacted , concluded , and constituted by its authority in church or state ; whether it be by making , enlarging , altering , diminishing , disannulling , repealing , or reviving of any law , statute , act , or ordinance whatsoever , either touching matters ecclesiastical , civil , common , capital , criminal , martial , Maritine , municipal , or any other ; of all , which , the transcendent and uncontrollable jurisdiction of that court is capable to take cognizance . 

Amongst the three things which the Athenian captain thanked the gods for , one was , that he was born a Grecian , and not a barbarian . for such was the vanity of the Greeks , and after them of the Romans , in the flourish of their monarchy , to arrogate all civility to themselves , and to term all the world besides barbarians : so i May say to have cause to rejoice , that i was born a vassal to the crown of England ; that i was born under so well moulded and tempered a government , which endows the subject with such liberties and enfranchisements that bear up his natural courage , and keep him still in heart ; such liberties that fence and secure him eternally from the gripes and talons of tyranny : and all this May be imputed to the authority and wisdom of this high court of parliament , wherein there is such a rare coordination of power ( Though the sovereignty remain still entire , and untransferable in the person of the Prince ) there is , i say , such a wholesome mixture 'twixt monarchy , optimacy , and democracy ; 'twixt Prince , peers , and communality , during the time of consultation , that of so many distinct parts , by a rare cooperation and unanimity , they make but one body politic , ( Like that sheaf of arrows in the emblem ) one entire concentrical piece ; and the results of their deliberations , but as so many harmonious diapasons arising from different strings . And what greater immunity and happiness can there be to a people , then to be liable to no laws but what they make themselves ? To be subject to no contribution , assessment , or any pecuniary levy whatsoever , but what they vote , and voluntarily yield unto themselves ? For in this compacted politic body , there be all degrees of people represented ; both the mechanic , tradesman , merchant , and yeoman , have their inclusive vote , as well as the gentry , in the persons of their trustees , their knights and burgesses , in passing of all things . Nor is this sovereign surintendent council an epitome of this kingdom only , but it May be said to have a representation of the whole universe ; as i heard a fluent well-worded knight deliver the last parliament , who compared the beautiful composure of that high court , to the great work of God , the world itself : the King to the sun , the nobles to the fixed stars , the itinerant judges and other officers ( That go upon messages 'twixt both houses ) to the planets ; the clergy to the element of fire ; the Commons , to the solid body of earth , and the rest of the elements . And to pursue this comparison a little farther ; as the heavenly bodies , when three of them meet in conjunction , do use to produce some admirable effects in the elementary world : so when these three states convene and assemble in one solemn great junto , some notable and extraordinary things are brought forth , tending to the welfare of the whole kingdom , our microcosm . 

He that is never so little versed in the annales of this isle , will find that it hath been her fate to be four times conquered . i exclude the Scot ; for the situation of his country , and the quality of the clime hath been such an advantage and security to him , that neither the Roman eagles would fly thither , for fear of freezing their wings ; nor any other nation attempt the work . 

These so many conquests must needs bring with them many tumblings and tossings , many disturbances and changes in government ; yet i have observed , that notwithstanding these tumblings , it retained still the form of a monarchy , and something there was always that had an analogy with the great assembly the parliament . 

The first conquest i find was made by Claudius Caefar ; at which time ( As some well observe ) the Roman ensigns and the standard of Christ came in together . It is well known what laws the Roman had ; he had his comitia , which bore a resemblance with our convention in parliament ; the place of their meeting was called praetorium , and the laws which they enacted , plebescita . 

The Saxon conquest succeeded next , which were the English , there being no name in Welsh or Irish for an Englishman , but Saxon , to this day . They governed by parliament , though it were under other names ; as Michael Sinoth , Michael Gemote , and witenage mote . 

There are records above a thousand years old , of these parliaments , in the reigns of King Ina , Offa , Ethelbert , and the rest of the seven Kings during the heptarchy . the British Kings also , who retained a great while some part of the isle unconquered , governed and made laws by a kind of parliamentary way ; witness the famous laws of Prince Howel , called Howel Dha , ( The good Prince Howel ) whereof there are yet extant some Welsh records . parliaments were also used after the heptarchy by King Kenulphus , Alphred , and others ; witness that renowned parliament held at grately by King Athelstan . 

The third conquest was by the Danes , and they governed also by such general assemblies , ( As they do to this day ) witness that great and so much celebrated parliament held by that mighty monarch Canutus , who was King of England , Denmark , Norway , and mher regions 150 years before the compiling of otagna charta ; and this the learned in the laws do hold to be one of the specialest , and most authentic pieces of antiquity we have extant . Edward the consessor made all his laws thus , ( And he was a great legis-lator ) which the Norman conqueror ( Who liking none of his sons , made God almighty his heir , bequeathing unto him this island for a legacy ) did ratify and establish , and digested them into one entire methodical system , which being violated by Rusus , ( Who came to such a disastrous end , as to be shot to death in lieu of a buck for his sacrileges ) were restored by Henry the first , and so they continue in force till King John , whose reign is renowned for first confirming magna charta , the foundation of our liberties ever since : which May be compared to divers outlandish graffs set upon one English stock , or to a posy of sundry fragrant flowers ; for the choicest of the British , the Roman , Saxon , Danish , and Norman laws , being culled and picked out , and gathered as it were into one bundle , out of them the foresaid grand charter was extracted : and the establishment of this great charter was the work of a parliament . 

Nor are the laws of this island only , and the freedom of the subject conserved by parliament , but all the best policed countries of Europe have the like . The Germans have their diets , the Danes and Swedes the Riicks' dachs ; the Spaniard calls his parliament las Cortes , and the French have ( Or should have at least ) their assembly of three states , though it be grown now in a manner obsolete , because the authority thereof was ( By accident ) devolved to the King . and very remarkable it is , how this happened ; for when the English had taken such large footing in most parts of France , having advanced as far as Orleans , and driven their then King Charles the seventh to Bourges in Berry ; the assembly of the three states in these pressures , being not able to meet after the usual manner in full parliament , because the country was unpassable , the enemy having made such firm invasions up and down through the very bowels of the kingdom ; that power which formerly was inherent in the parliamentary assembly , of making laws , of assessing the subject with taxes , subsidiary levies , and other impositions , was transmitted to the King during the war ; which continuing many years , that entrusted power by length of time grew as it were habitual in him , and could never after be reassumed and taken from him ; so that ever since , his edicts countervail acts of parliament . and that which made the business more feasible for the King , was , that the burden fell most upon the communality ( The clergy and nobility not feeling the weight of it ) who were willing to see the peasant pulled down a little , because not many years before in that notable rebellion , called La jaquery de Beauvoisin , which was suppressed by Charles the wise , the common people put themselves boldly in arms against the nobility and gentry , to lessen their power . Add hereunto as an advantage to the work , that the next succeeding King Lewis the eleventh , was a close cunning Prince , and could well tell how to play his game , and draw water to his own mill ; for amongst all the rest , he was said to be the first that put the Kings of France , horse de page , out of their minority , or from being pages any more , though thereby he brought the poor peasants to be worse than lackeys . 

With the fall , or at least the discontinuance of that usual parliamentary assembly of the three states , the liberty of the French nation utterly fell ; the poor Roturier and vineyard-man , with the rest of the yeomanry , being reduced ever since to such an abject •••nin condition , that they serve but as sponges for the King to squeeze when he list . nevertheless , as that King hath an advantage hereby one way , to monarchize more absolutely , and never to want money , but to ballast his purse when he will : so there is another mighty inconvenience ariseth to him and his whole kingdom another way ; for this illegal peeling of the poor peasant hath so dejected him , and cowed his native courage so much by the sense of poverty ( which brings along with it a narrowness of soul ) that he is little useful for the war : which puts the French King to make other nations mercenary to him , to fill up his infantry : insomuch , that the kingdom of France May be not unfitly compared to a body that hath all its blood drawn up into the arms , breast and back , and scarce any left from the girdle downward , to cherish and bear up the lower parts , and keep them from starving . 

All this seriously considered , there cannot be a more proper and pregnant example than this of our next neighbours , to prove how infinitely necessary the parliament is , to assert , to prop up , and preserve the public liberty , and national rights of a people , with the incolumity and welfare of a country . 

Nor doth the subject only reap benefit thus by parliament , but the Prince ( If it be well considered ) hath equal advantage thereby ; it rendereth him a King of free and able men , which is far more glorious then to be a King of slaves , beggars , and bankrupts ; men that by their freedom , and competency of wealth , are kept still in heart to do him service against any foreign force . And it is a true maxim in all states , that 't is less danger and dishonour for the Prince to be poor , than his people : rich subjects can make their King rich when they please ; if he gain their hearts , he will quickly get their purses : parliament increaseth love and good intelligence 'twixt him and his people ; it acquaints him with the reality of things , and with the true state and diseases of his kingdom ; it brings him to the knowledge of his better sort of subjects , and of their abilities , which he May employ accordingly upon all occasions ; it provides for his royal issve , pays his debts , finds means to fill his coffers : and it is no ill observation . The parlementary-monies ( The great aid ) have prospered best with the Kings of England ; it exceedingly raiseth his repute abroad , and enableth him to keep his foes in fear , his subjects in awe , his neighbours and confederates in security , the three main things which go to aggrandise a Prince , and render him glorious . In sum , it is the parliament that supports , and bears up the honour of his crown , and settles his throne in safety , which is the chief end of all their consultations : for whosoever is entrusted to be a member of this high court , carrieth with him a double capacity ; he sits there as a pairiot , and as a subject : as he is the one , the country is his object , his duty being to vindicate the public liberty , to make wholesome laws , to put his hand to the pump , and stop the leaks of the great vessel of the state : to pry into and punish corruption and oppression , to improve and advance trade , to have the grievances of the place he serves for redressed , and cast about how to find something that May tend to the advantage of it . 

But he must not forget that he sits there also as a subject , and according to that capacity , he must apply himself to do his sovereign's business , to provide not only for his public , but his personal wants ; to bear up the lustre and glory of his court ; to consider what occasions of extraordinary expenses he May have , by increase of royal issue , or maintenance of any of them abroad ; to enable him to vindicate any affront or indignity that Might be offered to his person , crown , or dignity , by any foreign state or kingdom ; to consult what May enlarge his honour , contentment and pleasure . and as the French Tacitus ( Comines ) hath it , the English nation was used to be more forward and zealous in this particular than any other , according to that ancient eloquent speech of a great lawyer , domus regis vigilia defendit omnium , otium illius labor omnium , deliciae illius industria omnium , vacatio illius occupatio omnium , salus illius periculum omnium , honor illius objectum omnium . every one should stand centinel to defend the King's houses , his safety should be the danger of all , his pleasures the industry of all , his ease should be the labour of all , his honour the object of all . 

Out of these premises this conclusion May be easily deduced , that , the principal fountain whence the King derives his happiness and safety , is his parliament : it is that great conduit-pipe which conveys unto him his peeples bounty and gratitude ; the truest lookingglass wherein he discerns their loves ; now the subjects love hath been always accounted the prime citadel of a Prince . in his parliament he appears as the sun in the meridian , in the altitude of his glory , in his highest state royal , as the law tells us . 

Therefore whosoever is avers or disaffected to this sovereign law-making court , cannot have his heart well planted within him : he can be neither good subject , nor good patriot ; and therefore unworthy to breathe English air , or have any benefit , advantage , or protection from the laws . 

Sectio secunda . 

By that which hath been spoken , which is the language of my heart , i hope no indifferent judicious reader will doubt of the cordial affection , of the high respects and due reverence i bear to parliament , as being the wholsomest constitution ( And done by the highest and happiest reach of policy ) that ever was established in this island , to perpetuate the happiness thereof : therefore i must tell that gentleman who was author of a book entitled the popish royal favourite , ( Lately printed and exposed to the world ) that he offers me very hard measure ; nay , he doth me apparent wrong , to term me therein no friend to parliament , and a malignant ; a character , which as i deserve it not , so i disdain it . 

For the first part of his charge , i would have him know , that i am as much a friend , and as real an affectionate humble servant and votary to the parliament , as possibly he can be , and will live and die with these affections about me : and i could wish , that he were secretary of my thoughts a while ; or if i May take the boldness to apply that comparison his late majesty used in a famous speech to one of his parliaments , i could wish there were a crystal window in my breast , through which the world Might espy the inward motions and palpitations of my heart ; then would he be certified of the sincerity of this protestation . 

For the second part of his charge , to be a malignant , i must confess to have some malignity that lurks within me , much against my will ; but it is no malignity of mind , it is amongst the humours , not in my intellectuals . and i believe , there is no natural man , let him have his humours never so well balanced , but hath some of this malignity reigning within him ; for as long as we are composed of the four elements , whence these humours are derived , and with whom they symbolize in qualities ; which elements the philosophers hold to be in a restless contention amongst themselves ( And the Stoic thought that the world subsisted by this innatemutual strife ) as long , i say , as the four humours , in imitation of their principles ( The elements ) are in perpetual reluctancy and combat for praedominancy , there must be some malignity lodged within us , as adusted choler , and the like ; whereof i had late experience in a dangerous fit of sickness it pleased God to lay upon me , which the physicians told me proceeded from the malignant hypocondriacal effects of melancholy ; having been so long in this Saturnine black condition of close imprisonment , and buried a live between the walls of this fatal fleet . these kinds of malignities , i confess are very rife in me , and they are not only incident , but connatural to every man according to his complexion : and were it not for this incessant struggling and enmity amongst the humours for mastery , which produceth such malignant effects in us , our souls would be loathe ever to depart from our bodies , or to abandon this mansion of clay . 

Now what malignity my accuser means , i know not ; if he means malignity of spirit , as some antipathy or ill impression upon the mind , arising from disaffection , hatred , or rancour , with a desire of some destructive revenge , he is mightily deceived in me ; i malign or hate no creature that ever God made , but the devil , who is the author of all malignity ; and therefore is most commonly called in French le Malin asprit the malignant spirit . every night before i go to bed , i have the grace , i thank God for it , to forgive all the world , and not to harbour , or let roost in my bosom the least malignant thought ; yet none can deny , but the aspersions which this my accuser casts upon me , were enough to make me a malignant towards him ; yet it could never have the power to do it : for i have prevailed with myself to forgive him this his wrong censure of me , issuing rather from his notknowledge of me , then from malice ; for we never mingled speech , or saw one another in our lives , to my remembrance : which makes me wonder the more , that a professor of the law , as he is , should pronounce such a positive sentence against me so slightly . But methinks i overhear him say , that the precedent discourse of parliament is involved in generals , and the tropic axiom tells us , that dolus versatur in universalibus , there is double dealing in universals : his meaning is , that i am no friend to this present parliament ( Though he speaks in the plural number parliaments ) and consequently , he concludes me a malignant ; therein , i must tell him also , that i am traduced , and i am confident it will be never proved against me , from any actions , words , or letters ( Though divers of mine have been intercepted ) or any other misdemeanour , though some things are fathered upon me which never droped from my quill . Alas , how unworthy and uncapable am i to censure the proceedings of that great senate , that high synedrion , wherein the wisdom of the whole state is epitomised ? It were a presumption in me , of the highest nature that could be : it is enough for me to pray for the prosperous success of their consultations : and as i hold it my duty , so i have good reason so to do , in regard i am to have my share in the happiness ; and could the utmost of my poor endeavours , by any ministerial humble office ( And sometimes the meanest boatswain May help to preserve the ship from sinking ) be so happy , as to contribute any thing to advance that great work ( Which i am in despair to do , while i am thus under hatches in this fleet ) i would esteem it the greatest honour that possibly could befall me , as i hold it now to be my greatest disaster , to have fallen so heavily under an affliction of this nature , and to be made a sacrifice to public fame , than which there is no other proof , nor that yet urged against me , or any thing else produced after so long , so long captivity , which hath brought me to such a low ebb , and put me so far behind in the course of my poor fortunes , and indeed more than half undone me . For although my whole life ( Since i was left to myself to swim , as they say , without bladders ) has been nothing else but a continue succession of crosses , and that there are but few red letters found ( God wot ) in the almanac of my age , ( For which i account not myself a whit the less happy ; ) yet this cross has carried with it a greater weight ; it hath been of a larger extent , longer continuance , and lighted heavier upon me then any other ; and as i have present parience to bear it , so i hope for subsequent grace to make use of it accordingly , that my old motto May be still confirmed , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . 

He produceth my attestation for some passages in Spain , at his majesty's being there , and he quotes me right , which obligeth me to him : and i hope all his quotations , wherein he is so extraordinarily copious and elaborate in all his works , are so ; yet i must tell him , that those interchangeable letters which passed between his majesty and the Pope , which were originally couched in Latin , the language wherein all nations treat with Rome , and the empire with all the prinees thereof ; those letters , i say , are adulterated in many places , which i impute not to him , but to the French chronicler , from whom he took them in trust . The truth of that business is this : the world knows there was a tedious treaty of an alliance 'twixt the infanta dona Maria ( Who now is Empress ) and his mijesty , which in regard of the slow affected pace of the Spaniard , lasted about ten years , as that in Henry the seventh's time , 'twixt Prince Arthur and ( Afterwards ) Queen Katherine , was spun out above seven : to quicken , or rather to consummate the work , his majesty made that adventurous journey through the whole continent of France into Spain ; which voyage , though there was a great deal of gallantry in it ( Whereof all posterity will ring , until it turn at last to a romance ) yet it proved the bane of the business , which 't is not the errand of so poor a pamphlet as this to unfold . His majesty being there arrived , the ignorant common people cried out , the Prince of Wales came thither to make himself a Christian . the Pope writ to the inquisitor general , and others , to use all industry they could to reduce him to the Roman religion ; and one of Olivares first compliments to him , was , that he doubted not but that . His highness came thither to change his religion : whereunto he made a short answer , that he came not thither for a religion , but for a wife . there were extraordinary processions made , and other artifices used by protraction of things to make him stay there of purpose till the spring following , to work upon him the better : and the infanta herself desired him ( Which was esteemed the greatest favour he received from her all the while ) to visit the nun of Carion ; hoping that the said nun , who was so much cried up for miracles , Might have wrought one upon him ; but her art failed her , nor was his highness so weak a subject to work upon , according to his late majesty's speech to doctor maw and wren , who when they came to kiss his hands , before they went to Spain to attend the Prince their Master , he wished them to have a care of Buckingham ; as touching his son Charles , he apprehend no fear at all of him ; for he knew him to be so well grounded a Protestant , that nothing could shake him in his religion . the Arabian proverb is , that the sun never soils in his passage , though his beams reverberate never so strongly , and dwell never so long upon the miry lake of Maeotis , the black turfed moors of Holland , the aguish woose of Kent and Essex , or any other place , be it never so dirty . Though Spain be a hot country , yet one May pass and repass through the very centre of it , and never be sunburnt , if he carry with him a Bongrace , and such a one his majesty had . 

Well , after his majesty's arrival to Madrid , the treaty of marriage went on still , ( Though he told them at his first coming , that he came not thither like an ambassador , to treat of marriage ; but as a Prince , to fetch home a wife ; ) and in regard they were of different religions , it could not be done without a dispensation from the Pope , and the Pope would grant none , unless some capitulations were stipulated in favour of the Romish Catholics in England , ( The same in substance were agreed on with France . ) well , when the dispensation came , which was negotiated solely by the King of Spain's ministers ; because his majesty would have as little to do as Might be with Rome , Pope Gregory the fifteenth , who died a little after , sent his majesty a letter , which was delivered by the nuncio , whereof an answer was sent a while after : which letters were imprinted and exposed to the view of the world , because his mijesty would not have people whisper , that the business was carried in a clandestine manner . And truly besides this , i do not know of any letter , or message , or compliment , that ever passed 'twixt his majesty and the Pope , afore or after ; some addresses peradventure Might be made to the Cardinals , to whom the drawing of those matrimonial dispatches was referred , to quicken the work ; but this was only by way of civil negotiation . 

Now touching that responsory letter from his majesty , it was no other than a compliment in the severest interpretation , and such formalities pass 'twixt the crown of England , and the great Turk , and divers heathen Princes . The Pope writ first , and no man can deny , but by all moral rules , and in common human civility . His majesty was , bound to answer it , specially considering how punctual they are in those countries to correspond in this kind , how exact they are in repairing visits , and the performance of such ceremonies : and had this compliance been omitted , it Might have made very ill impressions , as the posture of things stood then ; for it had prejudiced the great work in hand , i mean , the match , which was then in the heat and height of agitation : his majesty's person was there engaged , and so it was no time to give the least offence . They that are never so little versed in business abroad , do know that there must be addresses , compliances , and formalities of this nature ( According to the Italian proverb , that one must sometimes light a candle to the devil ) used in the carriage of matters of state , as this great business was , whereon the eyes of all Christendom were so greedily fixed : a business which was like to bring with it such an universal good , as the restitution of the palatinate , the quenching of those hideous fires in Germany , and the establishing of a peace through all the Christian world . 

I hope none will take offence , that in this particular which comes within the compass of my knowledge , being upon the stage when this scene was acted , i do this right to the King my Master , in displaying the truth , and putting her forth in her own colours , a rare thing in these days . 

Touching the vocal forest , an allegorical discourse , that goes abroad under my name , a good while before the beginning of this parliament , which this gentleman cites ( And that very faithfully ) i understand there be some that mutter at certain passages therein , by putting ill glosses upon the text , and taking with the left hand what i offer with the right : ( Nor is it a wonder for trees which lie open , and stand exposed to all weathers , to be nipped ) but i desire this favour , which in common justice , i am sure in the court of chancery , cannot be denied me , it being the privilege of every author , and a received maxim through the world , cujus est condere , ejus est interpretari ; i say , i crave this favour , to have leave to expound my own text , and i doubt not then but to rectify any one in his opinion of me , and that in lieu of the plums which i give him from those trees , he will not throw the stones at me . 

Moreover , i desire those that are over critical censurers of that piece , to know , that as in divinity it is a rule , scriptura parabolica non est argumentativa ; so it is in all other kind of knowledge . parables ( Whereof that discourse is composed ) though pressed never so hard , prove nothing . there is another rule also , that parables must be gently used , like a nurse's breast ; which if you press too hard , you shall have blood in stead of milk . 

But as the author of the vocal forest thinks he hath done , neither his country , nor the commonwealth of learning any prejudice thereby ; ( That maiden fancy having received so good entertainment and respect abroad , as to be translated into divers languages , and to gain the public approbation of some famous universities . ) So he makes this humble protest unto all the world , that though the design of that discourse was partly satirical ( Which peradventure induced the author to shroud it of purpose under the shadows of trees ; and where should satyrs be , but amongst trees ? ) yet it never entered into his imagination to let fall from him the least thing that Might give any offence to the high and honourable court of parliament , whereof he had the honour to be once a member , and hopes he May be thought worthy again : and were he guilty of such an offence , or piacle rather , he thinks he should never forgive himself , though he were appointed his own judge . If there occur any passage therein , that May admit a hard construction , let the reader observe , that the author doth not positively assert , or pass a judgement on any thing in that discourse which consists principally of concise , cursory narrations of the choicest occurrences and criticisms of state , according as the pulse of time did beat then : and matters of state , as all other sublunary things , are subject to alterations , contingencies and change , which makes the opinions and minds of men vary accordingly ; not one amongst twenty is the same man to day as he was four years ago , in point of judgement , which turns and altars according to the circumstance and success of things : and it is a true saving , whereof we find common experience , posterior dies est prioris magister . the day following is the former day's schoolmaster . there 's another aphorism , the wisdom of one day is soolishnes to another , and 't will be so as long as there is a man left in the world . 

I will conclude with this modest request to that gentleman of the long robe ; that having unpassionately perused what i have written in this small discourse , in penning whereof my conscience guided my quill all along as well as my hand , he would please to be so charitable and just , as to revers that harsh sentence upon me , to be no friend to parliaments , and a malignant . 

Finis .
