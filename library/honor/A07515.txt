TO The Honour of him , to whom the Noble Fraternity of Grocers , his Worthy Brothers , have Dedicated their Loves , in costly Triumphs ; the Right Honourable , PETER PROBY , Lord Maur of this Renowned City . 

TO be His Servant , that hath served 
Two Royal Princes , and deserved 
So Worthily of Both ; the Same 
Call not Service , rather Fame . 
At your Lordship's Command : Tho. Middleton . 

THE TRIUMPHS OF Honour and Virtue . 

IF foreign Nations have been struck with Admiration at the Form , State , and Splendour of some yearly Triumphs , wherein Art hath been but faintly imitated : There is fair hope that things where Invention flourishes , clear Art and her graceful Proprieties , should receive favour and encouragement from the content of the Spectator , which next to the service of his Honour and honourable Society , is the principal reward it looks for ; than not despairing of that common favour , this takes delight to present itself . 

And first , to begin with the worthy love of his Noble Fraternity , after his Honour's return from Westminster , having received some service upon the Water , by the conduct of two Artful Triumphs . Viz. The Throne of Virtue , and the Continent of Jndia ; which also by Land attends his Lordship's most wished arrival , accompanied with the whole body of the Triumph , which near upon the time of his Honour's approach are decently and distinctly placed ; the first , bearing the Title of the Continent of India : A triumph replenished with all manner of Spice-plants , and trees bearing Odour , attends his Honour's arrival in Paul's Churchyard ; A black Personage representing India , called for her odours and riches , the Queen of Merchandise , challenging the most eminent Seat , advanceth herself upon a bed of Spices , attended by Indians in Antique habits : Commerce , Adventure and Traffic , three habited like Merchants , presenting to her view a bright Figure , bearing the inscription of Knowledge , a Sun appearing above the trees in brightest splendour and glory : The black Queen before mentioned , lending a voice to these following words : 

The Speech . 

You that have eyes of judgement , and discerue 
Things that the best of Man and Life concern , 
Draw near , this black is but my native dye , 
But view me with an Intellectual eye , 
As Wise men shoot their beams forth , you 'll then find 
A change in the complexion of the mind ; 
I 'm beauteous in my blackness , OH ye Sons 
Of Fame and Honour , through my best part runs 
A Spring of living Waters , clear and true , 
Found first by Knowledge , which came first by you , 
By you , and your examples , blessed Commerce , 
That by Exchange settles such happiness , 
Of Gums and fragrant Spices , I confess 
My Climate Heaven does with abundance bless , 
And those you have from me , but what are they 
Compared with Odours whose sent never decay , 
And those I have from you , plants of your youth , 
The Savour of eternal life sweet Truth , 
Exceeding all the odoriferous sent , 
That from the beds of Spices ever went : 
I that command , ( being prosp'rously possessed ) 
The riches and the Sweetness of the East , 
To that famed Mountain Taurus spreading forth 
My balmy Arm , whose height does kiss the North , 
And in the Sea Eoum lave this hand , 
Accounted my blessings not in those to stand , 
Though they be large and fruitful , but confess 
All wealth cons ; ists in Christian holiness , 
To such celestial knowledge I was led ; 
By English Merchants first enlightened , 
In Honour of whose memory , only Three 
I instance here , all of this ' Brotherhood free , 
To whose Fames the great Honour of this hour 
Aptly belongs , but to that Man of Power 
The first and chiefest , to whose worth so clear , 
justice hath given her Sword up for a year : 
And as yon Sun his perfect splendour shows , 
Cheering the Plants ; and no Clouds interpose 
His Radiant Comforts ; so no Earthy part 
Which makes Eclipses in a Ruler's hart 
( As in that glorious Planet ) must come nigh 
The Sun of justice , all such mists must fly ; 
you 're in an Orb of Brightness placed and fixed , 
And with no soil must Honour be commixed . 
So to your worthy Progress Zeal commends 
Your Lordship , with your Grave and Noble friends . 
The Speech being ended , to add a little more help to the fainter Apprehensions , the three Merchants placed in the Continent , have reference to the Lord Maior and Sheriffs , all Three being this year Brothers of this Ancient and Honourable Society , which triple or three fold Honour happened to this Worthy Company in the year 1577.  Sir Thomas Ramsey being then Lord Maior , and Master Nicholas Backhouse and Master Francis Bowyer , Sheriffs ; having cohereuce with this years' Honour , matched and paralleled with these Three their as worthy Successors , the right Honourable , Peter Proby , and the generous and Nobly affected , Master john Hodges , and Sir Humphrey Handford Sheriffs and Aldermen . 

By this time his Lordship being gracefully conducted toward the Chariot of Fame , which awaits his Honour's approach near the little Conduit in Cheap ; Antiquity a grave and reverend Personage , with a golden Register-booke in his hand , gives life to these words : 

The Speech . 

Objects of Years and Reverence greet mine eye , 
A Sight most pleasing to Antiquity ; 
I never could unclasp this Book of Fame 
Where Worthies dwell by a distinguished Name , 
At a more comely season ; I shall tell 
Things sprung from Truth , near kin to Miracle ; 
With that of later days I first begin , 
So back into the deeper Times again : 
I only touch Thy memory ( which I know 
In thankfulness can never be found slow ) 
With Heaven's miraculous Mercy , to Thy Health 
After so long a Sickness , all the wealth 
Which thou with an unusuring hand hast got 
Which is not the least wonder worthy note , 
( Truth makes me speak things freely ) cannot be 
A greater work than thy recovery , 
Nine Brethren-senators thy Seniors all 
Whose times had been before thee , Death did call 
To their eternal Peace , from this degree 
Leaving their earthly Honour now to thee , 
Think and be thankful still , this seems the more 
Another observation kept in store , 
For seventeen Senators since thy time were chose 
And to this minute not one dead of those . 
Those are not usual notes , nor here it ends , 
The Court and City two most Noble Friends , 
Have made exchange a late , I read , from hence 
There has gone some most worthy Citizens 
Up to the Courts advance ; in lieu of that 
You have a Courtier now your Magistrate , 
A Servant to Elizabeth the blessed , 
Since to K. james that reigns with Salomon's breast . 
Kept the Records for both , from the Queen took 
Charge of three hundred Horse , three thousand Foot , 
Four Attributes cleaves to this Man of Men , 
A Scholar , Soldier , Courtier , Citizen , 
These are no usual touches , to conclude 
( Like to his life with blessings so endued ) 
Has chose his Brotherhood , men of that Fame 
For Bounty , Amity and honoured Name 
The City bounds transcend not in their place , 
And their word makes 'em prospero , God grant grace . 
Honour they never wanted , when was (null) seen 
But they had Senators to their brethren 
Nay , one record here to make joy more glad , 
I find seventeen that were in Scarlet clad 
All at one time of this Fraternity , 
Now five , for this hour's honour brings forth three , 
Fame triple will make triple virtue strive 
At whose triumphant Throne you next arrive . 
For farther Illustration there are contained in Antiquities golden Legend , the Names of many Worthies of ancient Time , by whom this Noble Fraternity has received much honour , such as were the worthy and famous Sir Andrew Bockerell , who was Lord Mayor of this City , the sixteenth year of King Henry the third , and continued in the Magistracy seven years together , also the Noble Allen de la Zouch , who for his good government in the time of his Mayoralty , was by King Henry the third , created both a Baron of this Realm , and Lord chief justice of England . Also that famous Worthy , Sir Thomas Knowles , twice Lord Mayor of this honourable City , which said Sir Thomas began at his own charge that famous building of Guild-hall in London , and other memorable works both in the City and in his own Company , Re-edifying also Saint Anthony's Church ; with many others that are fair Ornaments to Memory . Viz. Sir William Sevenock , sir Robert Chichsley , sir Stephen Browne , sir Henry Keble , sir William Laxton , etc.  Who by those Virtues that they were most addicted unto in their life-time , are Illustrated by persons of Brightness in the Throne of Virtue , the next part of Triumph that presents itself : next beneath Antiquity , sits Authority , placed between Wisdom and Innocence , holding a naked Sword , a Serpent wound about the Blade thereof , two Doves standing upon the cross Bar of the Hilt , and two hands meeting at the Pummel , intimating Mercy and justice , accompanied with Magistracy , who holds in his hand a Key of gold , signifying both the Key of Knowledge and of Confidence , the City Magistrate taking into his trust the Custody of the King's Chamber , the proper Title of the City ; and which Key of gold also stands in his Lordship's Crest , viz. an Ostrich holding a Key of gold in his Mouth , his Neck circled with a golden Crown . 

His Lordship by this time arriving at the Throne of Virtue , placed near Saint Laurence-lane end , Receives this greeting from her Deity . 

The Speech . 

I See great Power approach ; here makes a Stand , 
Would it with Virtue ought ? for some Command 
Seems so complete in Selfe-opinions Eye , 
It will scarce look on me , but passes by ; 
As if the Essence of my Deity 
Were raised by Power , and not Power raised by me ; 
But let such Rulers know that so command 
They build the Empire of their Hopes on Sand ▪ 
Still This remains , with Eye upon me fixed 
As if he sought to have His splendours mixed 
With these of mine , which makes Authority meek , 
And I 'm so ficke of Love to those that seek 
I cannot choose but yield ; nor does it wrong 
Great Power to come to Virtue to be strong , 
Being but a Woman , merciful and mild , 
Therein is Heaven with greater glory styled 
That makes weak things , as Clemency , and Right , 
Sway Power , which would else rule all by Might : 
It maybe said you did but late pass by 
Some part of Triumph that spoke Virtuously , 
And one such Speech suffices ; 't is not so 
In taking of your office , there you go 
From Court to Court , before You be confirmed 
In this high place , which Praetorship is termed ; 
From Virtue , if to Virtue you resort , 
It is but the same course you have in Court 
In settling of your Honour ; which should be 
Redoubled rather , that I hope to see : 
So Power and Virtue when they fill one Seat , 
The city 's blessed , the Magistrate complete . 
At the close of the Speech , this Throne of Virtue with all her Celestial Concomitants , and the other parts of the Triumph , take leave of his Lordship for that time , and till after the Feast at Guild-hall rests from Service ; but the Feast ended , the whole state of the Triumph attends upon his Lordship , both to Saint Paul's and homeward ; and in Soperlane two parts of the Triumph stand ready planted ; viz. the Throne of Virtue , and the Globe of Honour , which Globe suddenly opening and flying into eight Cants or distinct parts , discovers in a twinkling , eight bright Personages most gloriously decked , representing ( as it were ) the Inward Man , the Intentions of a Virtuous and Worthy Breast , by the Graces of the Mind and Soul , such as Clear Conscience , Divine Speculation , Peace of Heart , Integrity , Watchfulness , Aequalitie , Providence ; Impartialitie , each expressed by It's proper Illustration . And because Man's perfection can receive no constant Attribute in this Life , the Cloud of Frailty , ever and anon shadowing and darkening our brightest Intentions , makes good the Morality of those Cants or Parts , when they fall and close into the full round of a Globe again , showing , that as the Brightest Day has his overcastings ; so the best men in this life have their Imperfections ; and worldly Mists oftentimes interpose the clearest Cogitations , and yet that but for a season , turning in the end like the mounting of this Engine , to their everlasting Brightness , converting itself to a Canopy of Stars : at the four corners below are placed the four Cardinal Virtues , Wisdom , justice , Fortitude and Temperance , by each of them fixed a little Streamer or Banner , in which are displayed , the Arms of this Honourable City , the Lord Mayor , the Grocers , and the Noble East-india Companies : The outparts of the Globe showing the World's Type , in Countries , Seas and Shipping , whereon is depicted or drawn Ships that have been fortunate to this Kingdom , by their happy and successful Voyages ; as also that prosperous Plantation in the Colony of Virginia , and the Bermudaes , with all good wishes to the Governors , Traders and Adventurers unto those Christianly Reform Islands . 

The Speech at Night , presented by Honour , A Personage mounted on the top of this Unparalleled Masterpiece of Invention and Art , the Globe or Orb of Honor.  

Honor.  

BY Virtue you came last , and who brings home 
True Honour , must by Virtue always come , 
The right Path you have taken then , still proceed , 
For 't is Continuance crowns each worthy Deeds : 
Behold this Globe of Honour ; every Part 
It is composed of , to a Noble Hart 
Applies Instruction ; when 't is closed and round 
It represents the World , and all that 's found 
Within the labouring Circle of Man's Days , 
Adventures , Dangers , Cares , and steepy Ways ; 
Which when a Wiseman thinks on , straight he mounts 
To Heavenly Cogitations , and accounts 
The vexing Spirit of Care and Labour vain : 
Lifting himself to his full height again : 
And as this Engine does in eight Parts rise 
Discovering eight Bright Figures , so the Wise 
From this Life's slumber roused , ( which Time deludes , ) 
Opens his Heart to eight Beatitudes : 
And as I ( Honour ) overtopping All , 
Here fix my Foot on this Orbicular Ball , 
Over the World expressing my Command 
As I in this Contemptuous Posture stand : 
So every good and understanding Spirit 
Makes but Use only of this Life , t' inherit 
An everlasting Living ; making Friends 
Of Mammon's Heaps , got by unrighteous Ends , 
Which happy thou standest free from , the more white 
Sits Honour on thee , and the Cost more bright 
Thy Noble Brotherhood this Day bestows ; 
Expense is graced when Substance follow Shows , 
Now to no higher Pitch of Praise I 'll come , 
Love brought thee forth , and Honour brings thee home . 
For the body of the whole Triumph , with all the proper Graces and Ornaments of Art and Workmanship , the Reputation of those , rightly appertain to the deserts of Master Garret Crismas , an Exquisite Master in his Art , and a Performer above his Promises . 

FINIS .
