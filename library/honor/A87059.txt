England's joy , expressed in an ἐπινίκιον , to the most renowned man of honour , and temporal redeemer of the Prince , peers , and persons of this land , his excellency the Lord general Monck . 

So then victorious general George , go on , 
To perfect thy * {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} . 
Thus that great * make-king Warwick , thou 'lt outdo , 
And all the worthies of past ages too : 
As he 's proclaimed , so crown , and set Charles right , 
Then let * old Nick and Nol do their worst spite . 
So Kings May reign , by * postliminial rights , 
And suns come out o' th' sea , make new * bath knights , 
Which must dispel all mists ; all mischiefs yield 
To royal virtue , patience wins the field : 
Field without sweat or blood ; the cause so just , 
It need not stir one grain of English dust . 
Which were the beasts thou conquer'dst , tame , would be 
Thought but an easy human victory . 
But they were savage , hungry , fierce , and fell 
As Lybian lions , or those beasts that dwell 
In Indian dens , my men worse than devils , 
What hand but sacred could ere cure such * evils ? 
And only with a touch , by which we see , 
Thou canst outdo * Cesarean chivalry . 
Indeed we were afraid , good persons all 
Expected more a royal funeral , 
Than such a coronation , and to feel 
The dismal dint of parricidal steel , 
Rather than unction on his sacred head : 
But he 's delivered , and we 're brought to bed . 
So now he 's ours again , great George , and who 
But thee , shall we sing jo.  Paeans to ? 
To thee great soul of honour , who were 't born 
To be restorer of thy Prince forlorn . 
The great redeemer of thy country's laws , 
And brave assertor of the true old cause . 
 've given our sun to England , without wars , 
Overthrown fanatic meteors falling stars . 
Those proud usurping Phaeton's , that durst 
Sit in the chair of fire , till it burst , 
And singed all earth and sea it touched upon . 
Leaving us dark , in conflagration . 
Prodigious things were done , but all in vain , 
They mounted Cromwel's cart , thou Charles his wain . 
But yet th' Herculean labours found no end , 
New work was cut out for thee , by the fiend . 
More monsters still arise , a rebel rump , 
So often stripped and whipped , and docked toth' stump , 
Must needs start up again , oh cursed * Stert , 
How couldst thou still hold up so malapert ? 
After so many regicidal acts , 
O'rwhelming all , with bloody * cataracts , 
To play rex yet upon our heads , and be 
Our commonwealth , nay common misery ? 
Others have oft attempted to defeat , 
This many headed Hydra , but the cheat 
o' th' good old cause , revived it 's heads , and we 
Could hope no * {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} but thee . 
So dragon like , it dealt about it 's blows , 
None could withstand its fury , no not those 
That were immured , and fenced with iron chains , 
Posts , and portcullises : the city veins 
Were bloodless grown , to see their ports beat down , 
And tails with many heads usurp a crown . 
But  've delivered them and us , who'rt born 
To be redeemer of thy country torn , 
By such inhuman miscreants ; thy hand 
H•s from that creeping vermin cleared the land . 
Thou canst as easily kill such snakes as * he , 
That in his cradle , strangled two or three . 
None but our * George , could kill this dragon dead , 
And make romance for history be read . 
Against thy mighty arm , what force prevails , 
Who killest all monstrous heads , as well as tails ? 
Proceed and prosper so great George , and where 
Thou pleasest for to make thy hemisphere , 
thou 'rt still our constellation , lead us forth , 
And th' inspired needle 's not more true to th' north , 
Nor rivers to the sea , than we will be , 
To our dread sovereign Lord , King Charles , and thee . 
Nor shall we fear success in peace , or war , 
Whilst he is thine , and thou , our Northern star .
