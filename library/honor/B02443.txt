The covenant or , no King but the old King's son , or , a brief rehearsal of what heretofore was done . 

all sorts of persons of it take a view , 
you surely will confess that i say true ; 
let none mislike the same that cannot mend it , 
neither rashly censure him that penned it . 
to the tune of , true blue will never stain . 



Long time have i been a soldier , 
And have followed the train , 
Which doth make me now the bolder , 
The covenant for to maintain . 
When first unto the wars we went , 
And Essex did us entertain , 
It was then to a good intent , 
Though since we turned our coats again . 
In every church the covenanting 
Our undertakings did explain , 
Our endeavours were not wanting , 
The true cause for to maintain . 
By the parliament it was expressed 
Kingly rights for to maintain , 
And if his heirs they were distressed , 
They kindly would them entertain . 
Since many persons have repent 
For their ki•ted that were slain , 
Since the King this land absented , 
And did not return again . 
Plate into half-crowns was melted 
To pay the soldiers for their pain , 
We then did March till we were swelted , 
No to•…e at all we did refrain . 
Which makes me now call to mind 
Of remembrance this one thing , 
Which in the covenant i find , 
to defend the person of the King . 
But some will say i am a widgeon 
Because the truth i do maintain , 
It was only for religion , 
And opinions that were vain . 
Religion it is confessed 
Did wax then into the wain , 
As in the Covenan is expressed , 
For which many men were slain . 
We soldiers that then were listed 
The good old cause for to maintain , 
With good hopes we always feasted 
To bring home the King again . 
The second part , 

To the same tune . 





However that some have boasted , 
The hazard of it we have run , 
And through extremities have posted 
for no King but the old King's son . 
If any man claim Charles' right 
For whatever his father hath done , 
Death on him hath wrought his spite ; 
no King but the old King's son . 
If he was of the Roman faction , 
No favour here he should have won , 
But now we are all in great distraction , 
no King but the old King's son . 
And moreover understand , 
Illuminations did us draw 
To fight for our freedom , and 
To keep our enemies in awe . 
A proclamation then was made , 
Which no person can deny , 
And the world they did persuade 
It was for th' subjects' liberty . 
And afterwards to make amends , 
When three nations were undone , 
They were for their private ends , 
The soldiers lost , that all had won . 
Then many thousands were disbanded , 
Which before had won the day ; 
Great persons then dealt underhanded , 
And deceived us of our pay : 
Which makes us now live discontented , 
And repent what we have done ; 
By poverty we were tormented , 
for no King but the old King's son . 
If a single person we must honor , 
These lands in union for to bring , 
And must fight under his Bonner , 
Let us have our lawful King . 
Great Jove unite our hearts together , 
Our privileges to maintain , 
And send us good and pleasant weather , 
That our righfull Prince May reign .
