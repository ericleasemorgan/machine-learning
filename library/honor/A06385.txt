Love without Luck , Or The Maiden's Misfortune 

To the Tune of the new Celebrand . 



IN the sweet temperate Air 
of a May Morning , 
When Ver and Flora fair 
had been adorning 
The lovely Fields and Meads , 
Ualleyes and Mountains , 
Chéering the bubbling Brooks 
and streaming Fountains : 
When Younglings sport and play , 
( Aestiua's Holiday ) 
As I walked on the way 
for recreation , 
Where each Lad with his Lass , 
Neatly trip on the grass , 
As they the Meadows pass , 
in lovely fashion . 
Now Groves and Copses 
loud Echoes are ringing , 
The Mavis Robin , and 
early Lark singing , 
Philomela chants her note 
jugg , jug , most sweetly , 
And the fair Bird of May 
Coo-koo discreetly , 
Each Bird did chirp and sing , 
To welcome in the Spring , 
With cheerful solacing , 
and fragrant Flowers 
All lovely to the eye , 
Smelling most curiously , 
In choice variety 
for Lady's Bowers . 


Singling myself alone 
for my contenting , 
I heard a Beauteous One 
sadly lamenting , 
Tears down her lovely cheeks 
from eyes distilling , 
Sighing ; and cursed the Time , 
ere she so willing 
Had yielded foolishly , 
Up her Uirginitie , 
And grown in misery , 
after despised 
Of him she held so dear , 
Who had plucked from her there , 
What she most deemed near 
and highly prized . 
Lands that are mortgaged 
may oft be redeemed , 
But Uirgin-honor lost 
never esteemed : 
Were she the fairest One 
Nature ere framed , 
That matchless jewel gone 
and she defamed , 
In scorn it will be said , 
There goes one was a Maid , 
Yet hath the Wanton played , 
o , this doth grieve me , 
Chiefly to think that he 
Should so inconstant be , 
Loving him faithfully , 
thus to deceive me ▪ 
The second part . 

To the same tune . 



With that again she wept , 
Her griefs renewing , 
Whereon to her I stepped , 
her feature viewing , 
Thinking some Angel bright 
in shape of woman , 
So dazzled had my sight ; 
for I think no man 
E'er yet beheld with eye 
One more immortally , 
( For wit and modesty , 
grace , Art , and feature ) 
Decked with deportmentss fair , 
And Beauties passing rare . 
Thus I began . O Fair 
Divinest creature , 
Tell me , where lives the Man 
could be so cruel , 
I 'll right thee if I can 
for thy lost jewel , 
And force him marry Thee 
if thou desire it , 
That he so false could be , 
I do admire it . 
then with tears in her eyes , 
Mournfully she replies , 
he 's for some golden price , 
rashly is ventured : 
Else o'er the Seas is gone , 
With Marquesse Hambleton , 
And like a perjured one , 
left me distempered . 


But since the time that he , 
the Seas has taken : 
My friends despitefully , 
have me forsaken : 
Father , and Mother ; All 
Brothers and Sisters , 
Lewd Strumpet do me call , 
and as Detesters 
They loath my company ; 
I dare not come them nigh , 
But may curse till I die , 
all false Protesters . 
That seek their wills to have , 
And yet poor maids deceive , 
then do no credit give 
unto such jesters . 
no marriage yet at home , 
would I accept on : 
Till at length over come , 
by this young Captain , 
Who had vowed earnestly 
he would me marry 
And his fair promises 
made me miscarry , 
For fearing of none ill 
I yielded to his will , 
Sorrow my heart do kill , 
being disdained . 
Let this my misery ▪ 
To all a warning be 
To keep their chastity 
pure and un 〈…〉 . 
FINIS .
