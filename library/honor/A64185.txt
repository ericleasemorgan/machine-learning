by interpretation . 

Hang up a knave Mercurius , quarter a traitor Britannicus . 



Brittanicus , have at thee , look to thyself , for good faith i am John Taylor , and let it not make thee proud , that i am pleased to descend so low as to write either to thee or of thee . Your prophetic writings , ( With Booker's conjunction ) and delicate foisted declarations , and relations ( Being all nothings ) of their worthy orders , acts , and votes , with their Don quixotticall , Amadis de galldicall battles and airy victories , which being with judgement and discretion weighed and considered are nothing , nor ever will be any thing to any purpose . 

And if the round jobbernoll of Brittanicus were but capable of the capacity of owley-glass , he Might see that all the great something 's which he so dignifies , falsifies and magnifies , are nothing , have done nothing ( But mischief ) which is worse than nothing . 

You are merrily pleased to call Aulicus the scripe , or register to the junto , whereby i perceive that you can break jests better than make them , and that you have a foolish Rogueish desire to jeer your betters , but that your plentiful want of wit is your great impediment . 

Then you fall a scoffing the nobility here ( Which is no news as you promised a relation of news in your lying title ) but sure it is no new thing ( Though worth nothing ) it is your weekly custom To promise the persons news , and pay them with nonsense , your infamous works have titles of relations , and the frothy substance within is nothing , but your own inventions , fopperies , and fictions , for what knowledge of the affairs of great Britain can the persons pick out of your ignorant and ridiculous railing and revileing his majesty , his royal Queen , honourable counsellors , and all our nobility , gentry or others , with the reverend clergy , calling them Papists , Jesuits , priests ; are these things new intelligences , no , all the world knows those damnable designs to be no news from you . But it were news worth the hearing , to hear any truth at all from you , and it is supposed that you writ purposely to make yourself merry , and for some other trencher respects , to delight as wise men as yourself in reading and laughing at your fooleries . 

What knowledge of intelligence , or what profit have the persons for their money and time spent , in buying and reading your scoffing scandals & calumnies , you are pleased to bestow fine epithets upon them , as fantastical heads and hides , and the grave and reverend judges your wickedness is pleased to trench upon Rastal's abridgements , and to call them rascals , neither can the sergeant at law's quoyfe , or judge's nightcap scape the flout of your fool's cap , the quoyfes ( You say ) are quoifes of injustice , and the nightcaps of false judgement ; then you boast of your ( And none but yours ) parliaments late success , and your Scottish brethren's advance , it is well known , that your parliament hath the art to create , make , form , fashion and frame success into what shape they please , and be it either good , bad , or indifferent , they can metamorphose it into fears , jealousies , public thanksgivings , and these ingredients being melted with zeal in the secret chrusible of the public-faith , and so with hey pass and repass legerdemain it is transformed into money , and that money into rebellion . For your brethren ( The Scots ) advance , i will give you leave to brag of their success . 

Then you seem to be displeased at Aulicus , for speaking truth when he called you rebels , i do heartily wish that you Might truly give him the lie , but if you be not rebels , i shall suppose Faux , and ravilltack to be honest men , and that Wat Tyler , Jack Cade , Hackett , Penrye , John a leiden , and Knipperdolling died true martyrs . 

Britanicus says , the ensign is yet unhanged , that said he would kill the King , 't is very likely , for i am sure you have hanged , imprisoned , murdered , plundered or beggared as many as you could lay hold on , of such as were either ecclesiastical or temporal Protestant's , as would spend their livelihoods and dearest blood in defence of their true religion , and service of their sovereign . But your evasion is , that your traitorous ensign did not mean King Charles , but general King is the man he meant to kill , in this you are a jesuited equivocater in general , and a lying knave in particular ; you brag what a brave Cornelius Burgess you have , he is a very wholesome purified and repurified man , for the records of the spiritual court doth keep an account , that he hath been twice purged in that court , for two female servants of his , who by his joining of jyblets were both great with child in his own house . But these spiritual court purgings , was to weak physic to work upon him , so that he ( Relapsing ) fell to the old trade again , for which he was to be let blood , purged , dieted , and disciplined in the high-commission ; but that he and his friends so laboured the dissolution of that court , that it was abolished , and Cornelius ( By that means ) was left uncured , and i doubt uncurable , and i have heard of Cornelius his tub , which is the fittest pulpit for him and his rebellious doctrine , he is no Cornelius Tacitus , ( As you say ) but it were better for the peace of the church and state , if he were Tacitus , with all the rabble of his tribe of sectaries ; Tacitus was a Roman historian , and wrote the lives of some wicked heathen Emperors , but your loquatious Burges ( Whose discretion had more appeared had he been Tacitus ) hath with the vollubillity of his seditious verbosity , omitted Suetonius and destroyed tranquillius ; in a word , he hath talked so much strife and mischief , that thereby our former blessed peace and tranquillity is as rare to be found as truth and loyalty is either in him , or in his imposture scribe Mercurius Britanicus . 

Next ; he pursues the Bishops ( In the old beaten way of railing ) which is as common as the barking of dogs , and therefore i hold him not worthy of an answer . His ridiculous scoffs of the Earl of Bristol , the Lord Cottiugton , and Sir Francis Windebank , calling them Spanish figs and reisins , is such poor silly Rogish stuff , that the folly of Will Summer , or John dorye were profound wisdom in respect of it . 

Then Sir , ( To show your love to learning ( Like the rest of your sweet Master's magnificoes , Clarissimoes' committee and common-council men ) you jeer at the schools , which is a place renowned for a famous library through more kingdoms provinces and nations , then are in the Christian world , and the ever renowned founder ( Sir tho. Bodley , will for ever stand in the records of fame , when the memory of the calumniators of that magnificent fabric shall rot , stink , and be justly held odious to God and man . 

The Archbishop of Armaugh falls next into the rolling stream or railing strain of your aspersions , and indeed your commendations and approbation either of him , or any other man , is one of the greatest disparagements to blur and blemish a good reputation , on the other side , the ridiculous and malicious scandals which you are pleased to bluster against . Virtue , doth illustrate the brightness of it , and make it shine more gloriously perspicuous , ( For mine own part i had rather Brittanicus , and all his friends were hanged then that either he or they should be at the charges to bestow a good report on me , for every honest man would take me to be a Brownist or Anuabaptist , a rascal , a rebel and a traitor . 

The profound learning , the sincerity of the Protestant religion , the loyalty to his sovereign , the extraordinary pains of his studying , the manner , method , and elegancy of his frequent preaching , his charity , affability and carriage of his exemplary life and conversation ; all these virtues , being the unquestionable practice of this most reverend Bishop , cannot escape the snapping and snarling of Brittanicus , whereby the danger of a knaves good report is most plainly manifested . 

Brittanicus , you do amplify , and seem to stellify the rebellious Lord Denbigh , and some others , with the attainted and outlawed Say and seal , and if there were no other proofs of their delinquency , your justification were sufficient testimony . dear-ring ( You brag is come to you , i pray you make much of him , he is an excellent jewel to hang in the ear of a gallows , at which time a turned shirt of Holland May serve him for a winding sheet ( If the crows be not cozened . ) You say you look for Hopton next , ( You May look for him , but i think you dare neither look or see him where he is , if you look for him in imitation of deering , you May look your eyes out , and if you and your Masters and members had the grace to be good subjects till Hopton turn rebel , the miseries of this kingdom would quickly have a happy period ; in the mean space look to Hopton , for Hopton looks for you . 

You extol the Lord Gray of Warke and your speaker ( Nine yards London measure above ursa minor , ) prophesying that they with the common-counsell-men shall fill chronicles ; in this you are believed , for there are many men chronicled for disloyalty to their Princes , and setting of kingdoms in combustious contention , and why not they . And then you ( Victoriously ) do jeer our victories , you say we took certain prisoners , one was a trooper with five shllings 3d in his pocket , three men in scarlet breeches , and one dragoon in an old plush doublet , in this you keep your promise with your chapmen , in letting them have some news for their money , and no doubt but some of them have so much wit as to believe you . 

But you prize your general's blood at an inestimable value , that every drop of it is a ruby or an emerald , it is wonder that his exceeding excellency doth not beat thee for thy gross flattery , for he knows himself to be scarcely worth a pebble , and his loyalty to his King were overvalued at the rate of a saint Martens pearl . 

You tax us that all our letters are falsities , and we know that though they be written with all grounds of real truths , yet you have the art to falsify them , either by new transcribing , misinterpreted and prejudicated constructions , or forged counterfeit letters of your own devising and writing , which letters have been often interpreted by yourselves , sometimes at sea , out of a catch or an Oysterboate , by your victorious and unmatchable , admirable admiral , and others have been secretly conveyed to your generals and commanders , who have easily taken the poor papers , and sent them to London , by speedy order they have been printed , ( As full of your own lies , as your malice and the devil could thrust into so small rooms ) than they have been dispersed as dangerous plots and conspiracies , plotted by Papists , royalists , and cavaliers ; and public thanksgivings commanded to be given in all churches for great and extraordinary deliverances from fabulous dangers of your own devising . 

Prinne you are pleased to entitle , your protomartyr , in the worst times , and a champion in the best , Prinne hath heard of me lately in a larger tract , in my answer to his traitorous pamphlet of the power of parliaments ; and vindication of the new counterfeit great-seal , pennrye and Prinne are somewhat near in an annagram , they are nearer in their treasons , and no doubt they will be nearest , when Prinne suffers as Pennry did at Tyburn ( For less treason ) in Queen Elizabeth's time . 

The truth is , you do make bold with the names of some , who have been so bold to beat you squarely , and made you run away roundly , for which causes i will tolerate you to be angry , and revenge your Master's cause and your own with railing and playing the fool , that 's another full point . 

It is your profitable and safest way to keep your distance in staying at London or Westminister , & abuse his majesty , and as many as do love serve and honour him at Oxford , but your lies are not limited only hither , for their universality flees all over great Britain , by the false name of news : and because the gentleman is so exquisite and exact in taxing names in stead of news , the name of Mercurius Britanicus , ( As i am certified ) is James Hudson , which in an annagram is the sphinx , which the Oedipus of my pericranion makes a true signification , of , for it opens the riddle of the matter , the marrow , and the very intrincicall secrets of your name and pamphlets . as thus , James Hudson , annagram , oh , his madness , 



Thus your very name includes the nature of your weekly relations , the madnues of James Hudson , hath made abundance of fools , and knaves as mad as himself , he is mad in writing , and they are out of their wits , with countenancing , buying , reading , and believing his madness , which doth blow the coals that inflames this mad rebellion . But himself and his damnable lies and labours , are more really described in another annagram , of Mercurius Brittanicus , with his own name mixed with it ; as thus . Mercurius Brittanicus , James Hudsonne , annagramma , burn mi nonsense , why , it is accursed dreams . 

you see Sir , that your own name , with your accursed pamphlets title , doth most plainly demonstrate the lewdness , badness , and madness of your pestiferous news , and the reason is , you acknowledge it worthy to be burned , as being your nonsense , the question why it should be burned is , because it is accursed dreams . 

Thus you see that tailor the waterman ( Whose name you abused and scoffed amongst his betters ) hath fiddled a little with your name for this once . 

I could play with some of your Master's memberships such as have gotten too good estates in being bad servants to his majesty , as , Henry Vane senior , annagram , ruins any honor , 

Henry Vane junior , annagram , i honor vain Ruyn , 



or , William Fines , annagram , i am sinful evil . 





I could fool with the quondam grooms name , and tell him , there was a time when he was rich and very poor at once , till by his majesty's grace , he was rich in honour and estate , and now by his ingratitude , he is turned poor again , scarce worth a clout or rag of Holland . 

Then you tell us that Denmark and France are puzzled by the sweadish design ; indeed it behoves all the Kings of the earth , to take it into serious consideration how dangerous it is for monarchy , to be assaulted by a rebellious anarchy . and ( Arrogantly ) you spend your judgement , that nothing can help but Spain , and the pawn of Ireland , yes Sir , there is one that you know not , ( Or scarcely ever think on ) that both can and will help , without the help of man or foreign nations , or pawn of a kingdom . If you would but take God in your mind , you would quickly guess who it is that will help , but your cause is so bad , that you are fain to buy and beg help of your brethren , ( Some rebellious Scots ) for the payment of whom , you have pawned more than kingdoms , for you have mortgaged your souls to the devil , by your execrable perjury , oaths , vows , protestations and covenants . 

you hear that Holland is about to set forth some declaration at this time , if it be of his own writing , i shall do him the honour to laugh at it . You call Warwick , your unmatchable admiral , a brave man by sea and land , it is true that he is unmatchable in this rebellion , and his marks of a brave man , is his wicked constancy in an accursed cause . Sir tho. Fairfax , and Sir William Brereton are to high ( You say ) for any title that you can give them , they are not so high as they deserve , by ten steps at least . 

Then you tell us , that you had forgot one piece of news , you May do well , to let us have some small piece for our money , for you have told us of no news yet , but what is your piece of news , some good stuff no doubt , like the rest before ; but stand a side and be uncovered , this news is an humble wish , that ( For the edification of the ignorant persons ) their two thin houses of lower uppermost , and upper lowermost ( Which he calls the estates ) would be pleased , beneath and above , to annex to their commands , for the reading them in all churches , for the city knows enough already , and the country to little , and is it not fit that seeing all order , decency , and doctrine of Christianity is ( Irreligiously ) and blasphemously thrust out of the churches with you , that in the room thereof , the railings and revilings of this weekly Rabshekah May be brought in , which May in future ages make Mercurius Brittanicus , as famous for his madnewes and accursed nonsense dreams , as Mahomet is for his Koran . 

Then you say , that the parliament were in the worst condition , if it could not command all other courts in punishing delinquents , but if your thing at Westminster , were a parliament , they would have punished you for traitorous libels , against the sacred majesties of the King and Queen , the royal posterity , the reverend clergy , the faithful nobility and gentry , the true hearted commonalty , and finally , against the peace of all his majesty's kingdoms , these are such delinquencies , that they deserve less then to be dreamt a parliament , that gives them encouragement and rewards , these are no acts , or symptoms of a parliament . 

Lastly your words are , that you do not take arms against the King , but against those about him , cod is about him , and i hope ever will be , and environ him with his all saving protection , the blessed success he hath had in being still preserved from dangers , Might make you believe that God is about him , if you mean his trusty servants that are about him , that 's no news , it is their honour to be hated for their Master's sake . and if he will needs involve himself into their ruin ( Than belike you mean utterly to ruin them and the King together ) you can but only pray and sigh for the misfortune of the King , with a public thanksgiving , doing still our duty to the King . we thank you for your manners , i know none you have . 

Thus monster Mercurius Brittanicus , i have traced , tracked and truly answered all your madness for one week , which is as much as if i had confuted all that you have done , can , or will do , but if you meddle with me again . I shall make so bold , to bung up your chaps with a Gravesend toast . 

Finis .
