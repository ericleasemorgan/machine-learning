The stationer to the reader . 

Courteous reader ! 

Be pleased to take notice , that this loyal treatise was penned many years ago , and sent over from the Hague to be printed here , for his majesty's service ; but was hindered hitherto upon this occasion . The printer , to whose care it was commended , fell into some trouble , for some acts of loyalty , which were then called treason ; such as were the printing the late King's incomparable book , entitled ἐικὼν βασιλικὴ , in English , Latin , French and Italic : salmasii defensio regia : Elenchus motuum nuperorum in anglia , by dr. Bates ; and some other things of the like nature ; he was committed to Newgate ; his press and other materials seized upon and carried away by Hunscott ; his wife and six children turned out of doors ; and threatened to be tried by an high court of in-justice . under which time of tyranny and persecution this notable {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , arraigning and condemning the traitorous and rebellious actions of bloody-minded men , hath been forced silently to keep within doors . But since God , in his infinite mercy to this languishing nation , hath been pleased to dispel these black clouds , and to restore the sunshine of his favour by the glorious presence of his gracious majesty , i presume it May boldly come abroad , and tell these miscreants to their faces , their horrid wickedness in the barbarous murder of the most pious Prince that ever swayed the English sceptre , their designing the destruction of church and state , and sacrificing both to their own lusts of ambition and covetousness , the original ( As of all , so ) of this cursed rebellion against their lawful sovereign . 

But i shall no longer detain thee in the porch , be pleased to walk into the house , whic••ill entertain thee 〈◊〉 to thy desire . 



Cromwell's bloody slaughter-house discovered . 

Have you killed our King , and also taken possession of his goods lands and kingdoms ? Oh ye bloodthirsty and deceitful men ! Is this your Zion , that must be built with royal blood , and your Jerusalem , that must be raised with such detestabl• iniquity ? Oh ye painted sepulchers , w•ll no bones serve to fill you , but those of your King ? 

You ravening wolves , ( Whom God hath suffered to uncase yourselves of your sheep's clothing ) can nothing satiate your cruel appetites and hydropic thirst , but only the flesh and blood of our King ? whom with merciless hands and hearts , in an impudent triumph you have murdered before the face of God and his subjects ; whose royal posterities , and people's lives and estates you now hope to devour without any opposition or gainsaying . ( So cruelly heavy and barbarous is that iron sceptre , with which you think to rule this nation ; not allowing any fair and legal plea for either Kings or p•oples' lives , liberties , estates or r•ligion : but beyond all papal and mahume•ane tyranny you usurp over our souls , no less than our bodies ; and seek ( Now ) by slavish fears , and sinful agreements to make us all as much the children of the devil as yourselves : whose consciences ( No doubt ) like •ai•'s' tell you , your desperate and damnable estate : having sinned against the light of God , and his holy spirit , ( Some of you ) so impudently and maliciously , as justly excludes all hope of pity or pardon from God and man : having first treacherously betrayed , then barbarously murdered , both your and our King . 

Go on you Apollions , you Abaddons , in the spirit of Antichrist , to fill up the measure of your abominations , till you are drunk with blood , and stumble and fall together : oh you locusts , the black•st smoke , and noysomest vapour that ever the breath of the bottomless pit exhaled or sent forth into the Christian worl• , your maiden faces , in your first seemingly modest and fair pretensions to the King and kingdom , have now brought on the poisonous scorpions of your tails , after many cunning windings of flattery , perjury and hypocrisi• . 

B•hold the fruits of your oaths , prayers , fastings , your illuminations , raptures , and the sacred madnesses of your prophets ; are they not as the gr•peses of Sodom , sour and unsavoury , setting on edge the teeth of all men that have any taste or relish of true piety ? 

Are these the practices of saints of spiritual and seraphic minds ; of men living in God and in Christ by the spirit ? We call heau•n and e•r•h , and yourselves ( Who are to us as hell and devils ) to witness against you ; what can the most carnal , loose and profane A•••ists' do• more abominable , than you have done ? What have the fal•est Jews , the fierc•st Turks , the most brutish heathens , the renegado Chr•stians , the s•bt•lest Jesuits , or the m•st fanatic Anabaptists , and sc•••maticks , or any other , th•t are wholly without God in this world , ever done comparable to your immense villainies ? Yea what could devils do more , if they had t•eir w•llss , bu• by such instruments as you are , extend their malice to the utmost latitude of their powe• ? 

Have you not by treachery and tyranny usurped upo• all just power , and exalted yourselves ( Such despicable worms ) above a•l that is cal•e• God ? Neither King , nor parliament , nor laws , nor your own engagemen•ss to all , nor your m•ny proposals , promises and d•clarationss have any rever•nce with you , or we•ght upon you• but like riotou• and enrag•d beasts , you have overborne and trampled under your feet all th•t is either sacred or civil ; in the laws of God , n•ture , nation• , or this kingdom , of which you are members , though the most ulcerous and pestilent that ever the earth can bring forth , or bear . 

Haply your stupid pride and bruit•sh insolency will not suffer you to consider how odious , abominable and accursed you now are to all men , but such as are cockatrices of the same egg and brood with yourselves ; that is , seared saints , honest hypocrites , and enlightened Satans . 

We assure you , you are now looked upon by all sober and honest minds , as the heaviest and filthyest incubus' that ever oppressed church or state ; as the legions of unclean spirits , which by diabolical arts and magic of hypocrisy , have got possession of this church and kingdom , ( Till Christ by his power cast you out of , and suffer you like the demoniac swine , through the just judgement of God to be hurried headlong by your own terrors and despairs into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone . 

You are l•ke cursed cams , not mockers only , but murderers of the father of your country ; impudent ravishers both of church and state , to satisfy your most abominable lusts of tyranny , covetousness , and all licentious profaneness . 

Monsters of men , putrid apostates , execrable saints , shameless sinners , traitorous tyrants , what have you to plead for , or palliate with , your late horrid outrages and unparalleled villainies , by which you have obstructed the fountain of justice , altered the channel , broken the cistern , turned the clear and wholesome waters of our laws into blood , wormwood , and deadly poison ; while you have with unheard of tyranny and treachery , set up your private wills , by that public power ( Wherewith you were in••usted only for some limited uses ) above the m•jesty and lives of our King and his ch•ldrens ; above the dignity of our parliaments , the honour of our laws , the reverence of your c•untrey , and the regard due to your fellow subj•cts , and con•ederate nations ; and all this without the least colour of any call or authority from God or man ; reason or religion , against all obligations both sacred and civil , that Might possibly lie on men's souls to God or man , against many your particular pretensions and former p•om•seses of such due observance as became you• both as men , subjects , soldiers and Christians . 

You who are not the thousand part of his m•jesties' subject , how durst you knowingly act as in the name of all , and yet indeed against the duty , desi•es and consciences of all , but such children of Belial as yourselves . 

You that are for the most part such sons of the earth of so base extraction , of meaner education , strangers to all good literature , honour , or civility ; heirs of beggary and contempt ; whom most of the subj•ctss in England Might for your rudeness and b•rbarity justly have disdain•d to have set with the dogs of their flocks : how are you become the creators of a new heaven , and a new earth , who are such sons of tohu and Bohu , of chaos , obscurity and confusion ? 

You that at best are but God's brothers , the unjust executioners of his just vengeance ; as the evil and destroying angels sent among us for a time ; ( Though your exorbita•• malice and lusts disdain to be limited by your military commission , yet God , we hope , will restrain your fury who hath manifested your impious folly . ) With what forehead could you thus lift up your hand against , and set yourselves above all those who are confessed your betters , Masters and superiors : as if in a giantly impuden••••d cyclop•ck cruelty you could never be famous enough but by infamy ; nor fierce and wick•• enough , unless you •ought against heaven , against the express word of God , and his vicegerents on earth . Thus heaping up mountains of lies , perjuries , hypocrisies and cru•l•ieses , upon those vast and enormous lusts of rapine , sacrilege , covetousness , reu•nge and tyranny in yo•r hea••s , which nothing hath •u•r equalled or can exceed . 

You have indeed finished the masterpiece of your father the devil , whom as his first-born he hath filled with a double portion of malice , subtlety and cruelty beyond any , whose hearts like Elymas the sorcerer , or Simon Magus he hath possessed . You have nothing left you but impenitence and hell , ( Which you neither believe nor fear ) by which to make farther progress in your most flagitious and ever accursed villainies . 

What step have you more to advance to the blaspheming of the majesty of the most high God , both in himself and his deputies , lawful Kings and sovereign magistrates ? what more can you do or invent to the scandal of the gospel , to the exposing the name of Christ to open shame , to the trampling his blood under feet , through the hat•ed and de•estation of all nations , that are without the church ? How could you device more to adorn the triumphs of Pope and pap•stss ? to whose tails you are tied , though your fac•ss seem contrary : and whose business you have done , while you pretend to abhor their names , as much as d•vilss do pot•n• ch•rmss . 

What sea could ever wash away from the face of the Christian reform religion , the stain of that blood of our King , which you have ( In a page•nt o• justice ) most unjustly , inhumanly and barbarously •hed , to colour your malice , to sa•iate your revenge and to make way for your tyranny , if we the persons of England should b• our silence adopt , and by our assistance nourish those prod•gieses of rebellion , treason and confusion , which your libidi•ous Mars , by the h•lp of your prostitute and officious Venus , your unparliamentary junto hath lately brought forth and astonished the world withal . Was it ever so done , since the name of Christ was planted on the earth , save only by the spawn of those furies , from whom you are descended , who made such havoc first in Africa , after in other Western churches , and lately in Germany ? whose principles and practices you have as much surpassed , in hypocrisic , anarchy , cruelty , and blasphemy , as B•elzebub ( Your Prince ) May be thought to exceed the lesser fry of damned sp•ritss . 

Those impure Catharists exercised ( Indeed ) their donat•sticall and anabaptistical frauds and furi•ss , chiefly upon the vulgar , to the ruin of many thous•n•ss of the coun•rey persons and citizens ; but you like so many Ravilliacks , are not content to have spoilt so many noble and flourishing families , to have exhausted so many plentiful estates , to have made so many mourning widows , and fatherless children , to have destroyed the lives , and sucked the blood of so many Christians , your fellow-subjects , but you must in one day swallow up the two houses of parliament , in another murder the King , in a third cut off the right and inheritance of the crown from the undoubted heir , and all the King's children . At last you conspire to tempt us all by your simple and foolish paperfalsly called , the agreement of the persons , to join with you in the utter overthrowing of our laws , liberties , and the whole frame of this ancient and renowned kingdom , whose weight you will find too heavy for such weak atlases as you will shortly appear , both in counsel and in power , who are only wise to do wickedly , and strong to shed or drink the blood of your King and countrymen . Your cruelty hath fulfilled the wish of Caligula , at one blow to cut off the head of three kingdoms , and with him all m•narchy ; to make way for your lole•ocracy , a military tyranny , or Schismatichal anarchy . 

Thus have you been profound to deceive , skilful to destroy ; our souls •aint within us , because of such treacherous dealers , such hideous murderers , into whose snares the breath of our nostrils is fallen , and in whose deep dissembling pits the anointed of the Lord , our meek patient and most Christian King is swallowed up ; under the shadow of whose just authority , princely wisdom , and judicious piety w• hoped to have been safe . 

How doth this sometime famous and flourishing kingdom , now sit as a widow , oppressed , desolate , •espised ; full of unexpressible lamentations• the bitterness and gall of your cruel hypocrisy hath entered into , filled and overwhelmed our souls . 

How is she that was the joy , crown and Queen of all nations , the envy or emulation of all Christian churches , now become the horror and astonishment of her neighbours round about , the pity and calamity of all her friends , the •corn , reproach , hissing and triumph of all her enemies ? Nor is there any helper , comforter , or deliverer left , till God take the matter into his own hands , and pl•ad the cause of the King and kingdom against these proud Goliah's , whose uncircumcised hearts and lips , out of a •iot and supe•fluity of wickedness , have blasphemed our god , destroyed our King , laid waste and exhaust the ki•gdome , and turned this church into a den of thieves . 

Oh Lord arise , oh Lord consider , oh Lord hear the u•yce of our sig•ss , tears and prayers ; let the cry of the blood of •ur King and our persons come up to heaven ; have mercy on us for we are brought very low . 

Our gracious King , the husband of the kingdom , the father of his subj•ctss , the preserver of our laws , the patron of religion , the protector of the church , you have treacherously and barbarously murdered ; the two houses of parliament , ( Whose weakness , perverseness , unevenness , inconstancy and cowardice God hath seen , disliked , judged , and punished ) you have forcibly invaded , scattered and oppressed ; notwithstanding all your special engagements to them both of duty and promise , commission and trust . The •oyalty and love of the persons , you everywhere either with terror and cruelty seek to suppress and smother , so that they shall not dare to petition for redress , or complain of those endless calamities which they suffer under your tyranny ; or •lse making lies your hope and refuge , with forged semblances of compliant petitions , and counterfeit gratulations , you falsely and impudently pretend the concurrent votes of the countries , and the communities •pprobation to your most abominated practices : when God knows and even yourselves in your bloody di••imulation cannot be ignorant , that the generality of all men in all places , of all degrees , do from their souls utterly abhor , deprecate and detest , your execrable counsels , and accursed actions , which have thus brought upon us the abomination of desolation , through the damnable deceiveableness of your unrighteousness : nor do we believe that your pride and tyrannous hypocrisy either finds any comfort in them , or much con•iders those papers , which seem to own you or applaud your wicked deeds , further than they May carry on your strong delusions with the vulgar , whom you know to be neither very wary of evil , nor very steady in what is good . If you had the general consent of the vulgar ( Which you know you have in no sort ) yet neither is their judgement any good rule to measure the morality of your actions ; nor their inconstant pleasure any test of honour , virtue or piety : but indeed you ( As well as we ) are sadly conscious , that all those clamorous petitions for justice , by which you would seem ( As by oracles of your own inspiring to be fatally directed and divinely encouraged in your cruelties and treasons ) were nothing else but the strokes of the lions own tail , the more to enrage himself ; the very froth and scum , which arose only from the zealous activity and boilings of your own bloody faction ; who restless as devils , continually go about seeking whom they May deceive and destroy , we are well assured that your schismatical crew of regicides are no more to be compared to the persons of England , than the gleanings May be to the harvest ; or canters , thi•veses , beggars and jugglers to the sober and settled dwellers in this kingdom . 

no , every honest man , who hath any sense of piety , loyalty , modesty , pity or humanity left in his soul , ( as you have none ) takes up Jacob's words against you , cursed be your wrath for it is fierce and your anger for it is cruel : into the secrets of these men let not our souls enter ; Lord lay not the guilt of the sins of these men to the charge of the persons of this kingdom . 

No , let the blood of our pious , patient and most Christian King be upon you and your abettors for ever ; who , as without any sense of loyalty , pity or charity , so without any shadow as well as substance of justice , having neither law , rule , nor any due authority , first by fraud and unheard of insolency seized upon his majesty's person , afterward by flatteries , lies , and terrors sought to deceive him ; at last by mere force and b••stl•ke cruelty have massacred and as so many horrid assa•sinateses utterly destroyed him . 

And all this after many fawnings , and shows of loyal and tender regard toward his majesty and his royal family , as both your first proposals , and your after agitations , ( Honestly and very providentially discovered by Major Huntington ) do declare ; in which all men now plainly see , that you did but make way by the fox , to let in the wolf , and by your Dalilah to bring the Philistines upon our Samson : yea , after his majesty was not only entered into and advanced in a treaty with the two houses , agreeable to their votes , and the general desires of all his subjects ; under the most solemn national security and public faith , which could be given or pass between a King and his subjects , or indeed any honest men : but even when his majesty's great wisdom and goodness had so far brought all things to a fair closure and happy agreement , that the two houses were satisfied and resolved to proceed upon his majesty's conce•ionss , as a firm ground of peace to the kingdom . 

Yet after all these public , civil and sacred obligations , which lay upon the two houses and the kingdom , on yourselves as well as any and all of us ; for you to seize again upon his majesty's person , without any pretended authority , and with your iron hands , and adamantine hearts to ravish and pull him out of the arms and embraces of his subjects , violently to hale and tear him from the reviving love and loyalty of the two houses and his persons ; thence to hurry and toss him to and fro , to what inhospitable places , and desolate prisons you listed , there to deprive him , not only of all things proportionable to his quality as a King , but even of those civil accommodations , which ought to be allowed to any gentleman , though an •nemy and a captive of war ; which the King never was , not being taken by force , but rendering himself to the professed love and sworn loyalty of his subjects . After this , with a sacrilegious mo•kery of justice , in the highest affronting of God , the King , the parliament , and the three kingdoms , by an unheard of and most horrid outrage , and riotous force to oppress and utterly destroy the remaining honour , freedom and power of the two houses ; and in despite of them to erect a new court of justice ( As you most unjustly term it ) for which you have no colour of law from God or man , no precedent in this or any other Christian kingdom , no ground or pretence of parliamentary consent or autho•ity , of either houses ( Whose members , three parts of •our at least , you forcibly detained and deterred from sitting in the house of Commons , the Lords being unanimously against you ; by all which methods of cunning and violence you seek like absalo• ( The co•tradiction be•tween whose name and actions , very well fits your affected but undeserved title of saints ) to intrude yourselves into a judicative as well as a military power , ( As if hangmen and executioners should u•urp t•e seats of judges , who are not fit to be of a jury ; since their interest and advantage ( Like yours ) lying in the destruction of others , will •asily tempt them to condemn any man . ) 

At length you make a shift to pack , not a high court of justice , as you shamelessly style it , but the basest conventic•e of injustice that ever was in the world ; in which all cards of honour being shuffled out , you turn up such knaves only for trumpets as will best play your game : a very medley and r•psody of the most ignorant , shallow , cowardly , cruel , weak , debauched and insolent fools or atheists ; hypocrites , traitors and tyrants , that ever usurped power over any honest and innocent man : your president Bradshaw and your clerk cook are commonly known and branded to be men of as corrupt souls as any lived in their profession ; their most traitorous and covetous villainies not allowing the least pretence of ignorance in the laws , which are in no case more clearly , expressly , and se•verely contrary , then in this , of taking away the King's life , wherein they , against all law , du•y and conscience , were as judas•s •hiefly employed . 

At last upon the wicked , most unjust , and cruel sentence of these mercenary , unauthorised• and tyrannous sycophants , and hucksters of justice , ( Who must needs have their comm•ssion from him that is the father of lies , the false accuser , the old murderer , the deceiving serpent , the r•aring lion , the red dragon , the dead sea of cruelty and the sink of all confusion , the damned and damning devil , and not from God ( The fountain of justice , the father of mercy , the institutor of order , the author of peace , and the commander of ••bjection to lawful Kings ) in any ••tion imaginable ; further than the devil May have commission from God , permitting and limiting the activity but not approving the activity but not approving the iniquity of his rage and malice , ) to compel such a King , so great a monarch of three kingdoms , their undoubted sovereign Lord , to submit to the•r arraignment , Accusations• , and sentence ( Who were most of them his declared and desperate enemies ) without allowing him the l•be•ty of protesting against their confessed usurpation and non-authority , or of pleading for his own both innocency , and well known privilege , sovereignty , and unquestionable immunity , according to the laws of God and of this kingdom ; which are expr•ssely against their traitorous and tyrannous proceedings , as well as the nullity of their authority . 

After this , without an• remorse or pity to their and our King , to force a person of so excellent worth , wisdom , virtue , honour , and majesty to bow down at the feet of so vile persons , and then to chop off h•s head which was sacred , crowned and anointed , as rightful King over them and all his subjects in his dominions . ( A butchery so barbarous , that the common headsman abhorred to do it ; nor May we think those bloody zealots were willing he should d•prive them of the pleasure of cutting the throat of such a sacrifice , to inaugurate them in their royal priesthood ; by which their schismatical fury p•etends a title against , or above all lawful Kings and governors . 

What words , what tera• , what sihgs , what oppressive thoughts , what secret and unutterable reflect•onss of most stupifi•d and aston••hed sou•s , are sufficient to measure the immensity , to weigh the burden , to express or conceive the h•rror of this outrag•ous sin , and most flagitious villainy . 

poor Prince , after so many delusions , so many lying addresses , made by the chief engines and movers of the army ; after so much patience , so great demonstrations of excellent wisdom , meekn•sse , calmness and Christian gentleness to his very enemies and jailors ; under infinite reproaches , injuries and indignities , even to the very spitting in his face ; after all those gracious descendings , by which he had reduced himself almost to the u•ry shadow and bare name of a King ( Saving that he had gained the highest and most absolute empire in the renewed love and loyalty of the most and best of his subjects ) that he Might please all , secure and satis•ie all , purchase peace for all at any rate but the price of his conscience : yet after all these infinite demonstrations of goodness , capable to have softened even devils themselves , to be thus butcher•d by a soldie•y and schismatical cruelty , to be brought to public execution without any help or redemption from parliament or persons ( Who generally abominated so horrid , inhuman , unseen , and unheard of a spectacle ; whose public faith , besides their personal al•egiance was engaged for his Majest•eses honour and safety , ) what ••art can be large enough to equal the sorrow , what •yess can be fountains sufficient to d•plore so unmerited a fate , befalling so excellent a Prince , by the malice , ambition , cruelty and treason of so base and execrable villainies . 

And all this tragedy of tragedies c•rried on to such bloody conclusions , under colour of safety and reformation at first ; afterward of satisfaction and indemp•ity to the army ; in both which the good King deny•d nothing , that men of an• mod•st• , worth or ingenuity , could exp•ct or would d•sire . Yet a•t•r ••fi•ite delusions , and mutinous insolences committed against King , pa•l•am•nt and persons , some impotent and amb•t•ous tyrants , ( Who have the marks of blood and cruelty in their faces and on their foreheads , in the army and Commons house bethink themselves of a scene of justice , which must speedily be acted by them• least the closure of a peace with the King and the two houses should render their employment useless , as it hath long been burdensome ; and forcing their buff grandees and proud officers to return to their needles , their hammers , their lasts , their sl•ngss , their carts and their flails , should qui•e defeat those designs of power , estate and all licentious profaneness both in opinions and practices ; which their chief officers and levelling sticklers have all this while designed for themselves and their false , giddy , cruel , covetous and unreasonable faction ; through that power and influence , which by their lies , sorceries and hypocrisies , they with the help of that mongrel minister , that military priest , that modern Simon Magus , th•t disguised executioner , that bloody butcher of the King h — p — they have gained upon the common soldiery . Upon whose simpl•city and val•ur they have presumed tyrannously and trayterou••y to advance the mere will and pleasure of some officers in the army , and those rotten and ever infamous members of the Commons , over all the laws and liberties , the lives , estates and inheritances both of King , Prince and persons . 

Yet after all these scenes of various villainies , they have the impudence to glory , as if they had done God good service , and so extremely pleased God and the persons , that they expect all should agree to their pla•dite , as if Might and right were well met in the army . 

Oh you most seared consci•nceses , you most r•bellious souls against God , the King , and your own light ; you most accursed doers• you deaf adders , whether you will hear or w••ther you will forbear , know this , that we the Christ•an persons and l•yall subjects of England , do in the bitterness of our souls declare ( •s in the •ight of God , to whose just tribunal we appeal , and summon your stupid and cruel hypocrisy ) to all the world , our to all detestation , and utter ab•orring of your counsels , actions and future designs . you glory , as if you were now Masters of our estates , liberties and lives : but we shall by God's grace keep our souls unspotted from those great offences and presumptuous wickedness , wherewith you are infected beyond all cure or recovery . 

No we would have your impeni•ent hardness , as well as the softer world to know , that we look back with extreme sorrow , shame and repentance , upon our former delusions and forwardness to this unhappy war ; wherein though they were most to blame who were the deceive•ss and instigators of us ; yet we cannot excuse ourselves further than thus , that we did it out of credulo•• inconsiderateness , and not out of malicious wickednesse• the God of heaven , whose mer•ie• exceed our sins and your cruel ies , forgive the errors and •reat sins of this nation in this unnatura•l war ; which have deservedly as from the divine vengeance , though most perfidiously , as from your multiplied tre•sonss and wilful r•bellionss , b aught upon these kin•domss such a sore plague and intolerable opp ession as you are . 

Whose detected hypocrisy hath now made it clearly appear , that both King , parliament and persons •ere merely cheated and abused , by the Fra•d first , after by the force of those factiouss , schismatical , bloody and implacable spirits , your chief genius' ; who de•paired to carry on their wicked d•signss of ambition and tyranny , but by the means of anarchy , p•ofanen•sse , disloyalty , and public ruin of church and state . 

All which rottenness and villainy must be masked awhile under the names of reformation , laws and liberties , King and parliament , which we see too evidently ( Though too late ) after infinite miseries , oppressions , bloodshed , and delusions , amount to no more but a slavish submission to the will and arbitrary tyranny of a few sanguinary schismatics , cruel hypocrites , and desperate usurpers over all ; who , like deep ditches , and open sepulchers , having swallowed up , our King , our parliament , our estates , our liberties , and many of our brethren's lives , now like impudent strumpets , in the wantonness and security , to which success have hardened their hearts and foreheads , wipe their mouths as if they had done no evil ; and now lying in wait for our precious souls , dress their whorish faces with the harlotry and temptation of a new fashioned representative , and that both silly and ridiculous babble called the agre•ment of the persons . 

Then which never any poison was presented in a sordider and less suspected cup ; nor foolish devil never used less inviting baits for his snares : their gross and brutish unpoliticness offering nothing in that beggar's dish to the miserably abused , and justly discontented kingdom , but only such general dull and confused notions , as Might become the soberer sort of •ictss or highlanders , or the less savage ind•anss , when from their acorns , nakedness , and barbarity they began to form some conceptions of casting themselves into more orderly and civil societies , for their better government and common welfare ; so vastly short their m•tly agreement comes of those most tried , wise , noble , rational , just , and indeed divine principles and foundations of true government , order and polity , on which this famous monarchy hath for many hundred of years been raised to so stately a fabric ; having flourished to so perfect a beauty , to so ancient and venerable a glory , as became the Wisdom• , piety and gravity of our former Kings , parliaments and ancestors ; men of renown for true wisdom and heroic greatness ; to whom these late overturners and innovators of all government would scarce have served for their dwarves , zanies , and bussoons . 

But least these cursed movers of the ancient boundaries and landmarks should lose both themselves and us in the wood and wilderness of their poor , rude , barbarous and novel projections they bring forth their ignes fatui , lights of private inspirations , fan•tick delusions , false and falsified interpretations of wrested and corrupted scriptures , to make some show to their seduced pr•selyteses ( Whom they would rebaptize in the blood of the King with themselves ) as if they were the little stone cut without hands which must become a great mountain , &c.  They the saints which must bind Kings in chains , and nobles in links of iron , &c.  They the persons of the most high , to which the kingdoms of the earth must be given , &c.  Whereas true saints , which had the power , not show only of godliness , would not take all the kingdoms of the world upon such d•u•l•sh co•d•tionss , and by such d•mnable practis•ss , as yours are , most apparent , and by yourselves confessed to be unjustifi•ble . Such scripture paintings upon the f•ce of your jezeb•ll would have served the turn of John of Leyden , knipp•rdoling , Muncer , and those other impostors your infamous predecessors , as well as you and indeed they were by them no less pretended ; but with how blessed success you are loathe to own or remember , as presaging your like destinies in God's due time . 

It is a strange and unwonted way of any sound and true Christians , apparently to violate and wholly decline from the obedience of clear moral precepts of justice and other both religious and civil duties to God and man , under a pretence of zeal and a call to fulfil prophetic obscurities ; which darkly foretell what shall be done but do not precisely command us to do this or that ; in which eve••s even the wickedest men and antichrists ( Such as these are ) May , as the vials of the wrath of God , pour out themselves , and have a great part to act , and yet receive no comfort or reward , other than that of hypocrites ; who May ( As Joseph's brethren , and N•buchadnezzar did ) then most serve God's p•ophetick and providential disposings , when they act most contrary to h•s revealed will , and only seek to se•ve their own envy , covetousness and unsatiable tyranny , however they May as the devil bait their temptations with scripture allegations . 

But know oh ye hard-•earted belsazzars ( Whom no •and-writing out of God's words , clearly setting forth your sin , curse , woe and damnation can yet scan or deter from your frolic villainies ) that , if you were angels from heaven , as you are Luciferan brats from hell , ( Transforming yourselves at first into angels of light : but now fully uncased ; so that now your fiery eyes , your black and wide mouths , your blasting and sulphurous breath , your proud horns , and your cloven feet appear to all but your own besotted •mpss and familiars• if ( We say ) you yet appeared as angels , yet you should give us leave to believe the express will and word of God , rather than your juggling fancies , to which that is diametrically contrary , both in the precept and all practices of Christ and his true saints . H•ar how the voice of God disagrees with your apparent folly and madness . He bids honour and obey the King and our lawful governors ; you cry cr•cifie , destroy , and scatter them . Christ commands to give unto Caesar's that which is Caesar's , no less than to God what is God's : but you take away as from God and his church what is his ; so from our Caesar , his empire , liberty , life , posterity and all . 

The voice of God bids us se•k peace and ensue it , branding with the reprobate marks of hypocrites , those that as traitors , heady , high-minded , and fierce despisers of what is good , break all truce or treaties , which you have done , beyond what ever the falsest miscreants ever did . 

The word of God is a clear constant , uniform light as to the rules of an holy life in piety , equity and charity ; •ut your opinions , practices and pious pretensions , centaur-like are various and deformed changelings , many-shapen and misshapen monsters , shifting Proteuses , slippery and virtiginou• serpents , folded and hidden in the winding labarinths and intr•cate circulations of your many subtle , •ly , and perplexed designs . 

The truth is , there is as wide a difference between your clamours , h•wlings , and hideous yellings ( Which sound nothing but war , blood , rebellion , famine , death , desolation and damnation ) and that soft• sweet gracious and most glorious u•yce of God in the holy scriptures , ( Which you use for a net not a garment ) as there is between the most bright beautiful soul savi•g-truthss , and most black deformed souldamning-lies . yourselves cannot think us uncharitable , if we do believe and tell you , that you have more blasphemed the spirit , name , grace , word , saints , and servants of God , by intitling these as inspirers , authors , and approvers of your most graceless and devilish practices ; then ever those hard-hearted and impudent hypocrites the Pharisees did , by imputing the saving miracles of our Lord Jesus Christ to your Beelzebub the Prince of devils ; whose servants you are , whose work you do , and whose wages you must expect . 

Nor do we doubt but all the curses written in the book of God ( Which like that of Meroz , have been causelessly , factiously and falsely by some of you•double•faced Janus' formerly imprecated upon the King and his loya•••st subjects ) will certainly overtake and fall upon both you and your viperous generation . 

We hope God will in his infinite goodn•sse not suffer this dying church and desolated nation , to be further partakers of your Babylonish sins and open sorceries least we be partakers of your plagues and torments ; which are laid up in the treasures of the wrath both of God and all good men against you and your desperate faction . 

We tell you , we are so far from Counting you saints and saviours , that we look up•n you as the Tophet which God hath indeed prepared for the King and these kingdoms , to try and torment them a while ; but we doubt not , but God will at last cast you ( Who are our sin , our death , and our hell ) into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone for ever . 

Unless you repent ; so many of you officers and soldiers as are capable of repentance , not being so deeply and maliciously engaged in the desperate sins of those men your chief leaders and seducers , who being past feeling , of a most r•probate sense , greedy and unreas•nable sinners , make no conscience to damn your souls , for the perf•cting their ambitious and covetous designs , for which they have hitherto made use of the hands of so many valiant men worthy of a better work and a nobler war , whereby to destroy your and our King , subvert our parliaments , laws , government , and religion ; and all this , against all your and our protestations , vows , oaths , promises and covenants to God and man . 

Oh you that have followed these theudasses , as the seduced persons sometime did Absalon in the simplicity of your hearts , not aware of their devilish stratagems , devises , and designs ; you that have any touch of God's spirit , or his grace in your hearts ; any fear of God or dread of sin left in you ; you that have any sense of your souls eternal welfare ( Which those either qu•stion or deny ) any terror of the wrath of God , or hope of his love and mercy ; you that are afraid to degenerate into unreasonable beasts , or incarnate devils , ( That you May enjoy the benefit of the Kings last charitable prayers for your pardon and repentance ) make haste to depart from the tents of these Achan's , these Korah's , these sinners who know themselves accursed of God and men . Come out of their Babylon , which is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , a cage of every unclean and hateful bird , by a penit•nt and pious withdrawing from such filthy harpies , such cunning , yet cruel hyenas , such weeping yet devouring crocodiles ; such banners as bear not the King's arms , but his head cut from his body ; such banners as are died in the blood of their King , murdered by them , while they pretended to fight for him , and preserve him . 

Oh drink no more of the wine of the wrath of their fornications , which they hold forth in that poisonous and filthy cup of their agreement of the p•ople ; with which they hope to make drunk this whole nation ; that as Lot's incestuous daughters ; their lusts May be fully impregnated b• the conjunction of the strength , riches and counsel of these kingdoms : know you for certain ( Oh you soldiers ) that no place of repentance can be found among those Esau's and Judas' who have been the chief and mal•cious actors and contrivers of these wicked and cruel confusions ; whose names as we well know ; so we are sure the hand of God will find them out ; making them ( Who have been the terror and torture of men of all degrees , ) to become as Pashur , Magorncissabis ; terror round about , as a wheel , in past revolutions from prosperous wickedness to miserable punishments ; as chaff tossed to and fro by the breath of God's displeasure , and the execration or abhorrence of all persons in all nations , Christian and heathen ; where ever they are driven to be vagab•ndss and runagates : carrying with them in their festered conscienc•ss the forked arrow , of their deceiving and then cruelly destroying both their King , and their country . 

And this , till they are cast into the chains of utter da•kness , who have quenched the light of Israel ; and to everlasting flames , whose wrath kindled with the fire of hell , hath burned to the very foundations of so happy a nation . 

No person of worth , honour or piety , but will ever loath to eat , dri•k , or converse with them , looking upon them as unlucky prodigies : much more will every ingenuous man or woman abhor ever to marry or make any affinity with them , or their families polluted with the blood of their King ; but mo•t of all abominated will they be as to any communion with them in prayer or other religious duties ; who having turned the grace of God into wantonness ; cannot but already hear Judases si enter clamours , deep despairings and self-condemnings ; like Julian the apostate , they cannot but feel the secret and sma•t strokes of God in their consciences , for betraying , persecuting and destroying the innocent blood of our King . Oh e•rth cover it not , oh Tim• forget it not , oh heaven fail not to reveng• their prodigal a•d cruel wast of so royal and precio•s blood ! Sur•ly without any uncharitab•e ra••n•sse , they May be suspected to be past all grace and recovery by any prayers . There remaining for such sinners of the sin to death , such relapsing swine and reso•bing dogs , who pre•ending to have escaped the poll of the world , are returned to their mire and vomit ; feigning to be illuminated saints ; yet have wrought such works of thick darkness , nothing but a fearful expectation of vengeance , a•d fiery indignation to consume them . 

They have impudently and traitorously judged , condemned , and murdered the King upon the pretence of his raising war against the parliament ; of which fact themselves are doubly and most unquestionably guilty before all the world , twice menacing , invading , and forcibly assaulting their Masters in the two houses of parliament . Nor if their charge had been true against the King ( Which upon his death he both denied , and most evid•ntly p•oved by the legal right he had to the militia , and the date of their commissions for raising war , before his majesties were out ) yet were not these usurpers any competent judges by God or man appointed ; nor was indeed that calumny the real motive of their sudden , bloody , and resumed cruelty ; but only that extreme fear , hatred and terror their hypocrisy and villainy had conceived against the King's excellent wisdom , constant piety , and immovable goodness ; which they had so often , and so unmeasurably abused ; and which they saw was the chiefest obstacle in the way of their sacrilegious ambition . 

And now like desperate empirics upon whose c•uel tamperings we have sp•nt our blood , our estates , our lives ; the honour of our nation• and the credit of our reform religion : you ( Now ) pr••end to stop that bloody issue ( Which by tumult and treason you have made ) by destroying the whole royal family , and le•ting out all the ancient blood of our Kings out of the veins of these kingdoms ; to ext rpate Kings , peers , and parliaments ; and by ••dle fi•tionss of your weak and c•n•used brains to obtrude the fri•p•ry and gull•ry of •our agreeme•t of the persons . 

As if all rules of justice , all true policy and reason of state , and good grounds of government ( No less than all wickedness , cruelty , hypocrisy and treason ) only dwelled in your shallow brains and narrow •eartss : who for the most part are not guilty of any learning or civil improvements ; are open and declared authors of ignorance , con•usion and tyranny ; enemies to all sober manners and good order , both in church and state . 

Nor do those great things ( As you call them ) which you have hitherto with most inf•mous treachery and cruelty peracted and attained , any way render you considerable with sober , godly and truly wi•e men : for what May not frontless hypo•riteses do , who have forsaken God , and given themselves over to the devil's captivity , when impowered with arms and might , they resolve barbarously to break through , and cast off , all bonds of right , trust , duty , credit and conscience to God and man , as you h•ve done . 

But oh you hardened and infatuated regicides , c•n you in good earnest flatter yourselves , that this foolish toy , this shameless imposture , your bastard brat , your headl•sse Chimaera , your many-headed Hydra , call•d the agreement of the persons , ( But by as •ull an antiphrasis , as the fiends and •uriess of hell were called Eumenides ) will be a salve sufficient to heal , or plaster to cover the wide deep and festered wounds , which your treacherous cruelty hath made upon this kingdom in all estates , both jointly , as in parliament , and severally , as in t•e interests of the crown , the nobility , the clergy and the comm•nss . 

No , yourselves know , that very ti•le , which you shameles•y impose upon your mad and deformed model is nothing but a lie and f•lsity ; b•ing in no sense the a•r•ement of the persons , nor we hope ever like to be . Neither in their representatives the Commons , whom you have disbanded and cashiered in the majority ; leaving •nly som• few members left• whose a•inine p•tience and stupidity suffers th' bala•mss of the army , as mad and false prophets to ride upon them for the price of blood , and wages of iniquity : to which vassalage , we hope no gentlemen of any honour or conscience , will ever betray themselves or their country by returning to that house again , or sitting and voting there , while it is under such insolent tyrants . 

Nor will you find it more agreeable to the generality of the persons throughout the kingdom both ministers and others , who in their souls disagree as much from what you have done and by that further design , •s li•ht doth from darkness , liberty from oppression , and g•d from your dictator the devil . 

No , the persons of England , will o•e day ( If God please to cast his net upon you , and put his hook into the all d•vouring jaws of your Leviathan ) make you and your Dawbers with the untempered mortar of a mouldered and dissolved parliament , to unde•stand ; that they abominate •ou and your deeds , as much as hell itself ; for your monstrous sins are their own hell and horror , more to be detested then all the sinl•sse sufferings of he•l . 

The ancient and most honourable h••se of peers , whom sometimes you flattered into a fool's paradise , ( While the poor shreds and remnants of that court Might serve your •urn to face yo•r affairs by any s••w of their authority ) as if you had designed nothing to their dim•••tion : yet you have wholly laid t•em aside , as useless and dangerous idols of honour , fit to be cast out to the bats and moles , to be leveled unto or abased beneath , the meanest animals , and vilest beasts of the persons ; for though they should , any of them , so dishonour themselves as to descend into the hell of your infected walls ; yet c•uld •hey never there ascend to any degree of public influence either for counsel or action , be•ng sure to be always overlay•d , smothered and oppressed by your over voting crew of mechanic idols ; who saving that they have mouths to speak a treasonable Y•a or No ; in other points , have eyes and see not , noses but smell not , hearts but consider not , the blood , cruor , carcases , skulls and dead bo•es of their King and their brethren of all degrees , with which they have inhuman•ly filled that charn•ll-house , that Golgotha of that quondam h•use of comm•nss . 

Sure the numerous , and once both famous and flourishing nobility of England , besides those of Ireland and Scotland , cannot but infinitely abhor and detest your arrogant despising of them , and trampling upon them ; if they have but any drops of their ancestors noble blood running in their veins , or any sparks of true honour left in their breasts : it will at length kindle such a fire of just indignation and revenge in those cedars as shall consume such base shrubs , such offensive thistles , and such domineering briars : but if their ignoble despondency have so debased them to luxury and cowardice , that they dare not vindicate the honour of their nation , name and order , together with the rights of the crown , the fountain of their honour , but are content to be either bowed , or hewed down , or overdripped , or exsuccated by such aspiring ivies as you are ; our counsel is , that the ancient Barons of England , sometimes peers and chief counsellors in parliament , would solemnly degrade themselves , lay aside their vain and ridiculous titles , reverse their escutcheons , sell their scarlet robes to the brokers in Long-lane , rather than keep them , either to feed moths , or to be monuments to all posterity , what capons , poultroons and degenerous buzzards they are , descended from such eagl•ss , as many of their ancestors were . 

But if the nobility should so far betray and desert themselves , their posterity , their King and their country ( Who though their number be not great , yet their interest is ; and so Might their influence on the public yet be , both great and good , if their spirits and gallantry were such , yet , how can you the greater bugs of the army ; or you the lesser vermin and maggots of the Commons ( Who survive and crawl after the dissolution of your parliament ; bred of , and feeding upon , the putrefaction of that house ) how can you think , that the persons of England , who are generally and highly concerned in the honour , credit and religion of the nation , can ever with a good con•cience , or any face of common honesty agree to your juggling and sophistry ; as if you or your Western Mahomet and new Antichrist ( Hugh Peter ) had any pap•l power to absolve their souls from those protestations , covenants , o•thss of allegiance and supremacy , by all which they were and are both lawfully and •eligiously bound , under the greatest curses of God both to the kingdom in general , and specially to the parliaments privileges , and the rights of the King and his lawful successors : of which gross and manifold perjuries they must make themselves guilty , only to make way to the dictatorship and empire of some of yo•r greater brambl•ss ; that ( Forsooth ) the persons of England Might enjoy that liberty , peace and plenty under your unavoidable tyranny , unsatiable rapine , and cruel oppression ; o• such beggars as most of you are , and were , which formerly they c•uld never have under the gracious King's wi•e and loyal parliaments , the ingenuous laws , and excellent government of this sometime flourishing kingdom . 

Sure you are not yet so much beasts as to think , that the community of this great persons can all govern themselves , or mutually one another : government must necessarily be settled a•d centred somewhere : nor is it likely , that your leaders and bashas , whose hands are embrued in the blood of their King , will ever be so modest , as to lay themselves aside ; and denying their own most ambitious and cou•tous desires , to let any others but themselves and their creatures reap the fruit of their projects and labours ; for which they have pawned their souls to the devil , and sold themselves as Ahab to do wickedly . 

But , if you dare venture it upon so ingenuous a trial , let the persons of England without your terror , cunning , injurious restraints and exceptions be their own umpires , and choosers , whether they will bear the light and easy yoke of the •awss , and the gentle as well as just chastisements of their penalties under a lawful King , or the iron-yoke of your tyranny , and the scorpions of your wills , being so many evening wolves , bloody traitors , and unlimited tyrants , ( Whose little fingers in these last three years have been infinitely heavier than the loins of all the Kings , that ever were in this kingdom ) let the persons have free suffrages , you will soon find , that the true agreement of the persons ( A hundred voices to one ) is this , to shake off your cruel tyranny , to bring to condign punishment such unheard of traitors ; and to invest in his throne our lawful King Charles the second ; the elder son of that good King you lately murdered . But how can the persons of England ever hope to have any other civil agreement of theirs bin•ing to you and your pragmat•ck faction ; further than your own fancies , lusts , and pleasures think fit ; since they find you to have so lately broken through all laws of God and man ; all ancient and fundamental agreemen's in this nation , on which the honour and safety of our Kings , the privileges of our pa•liamentss , the liberties of the persons , the order and purity of our church , and the happiness of our nation were settled ? What cautions can you give that you will hereafter submit to any public agreement ; who are such shifters , jugglers and dissemblers , that no laws , leagues , covenants , protestations or promises you freely make can bind •ou ; no faith to King , parliament , persons , neighbour nations , or God a•mighty can hold you ; but like the man possessed with the unclean spirit , you break all ties and bonds , casting church and state into fire or water , as the rash motions of your frantic humours carry you , &c.  

conscience you can have none ; since your lights are so lunatic , and your principles vary every month . 

credit you have none , who have made bankrupt of the publiq•e faith , and forfeited so many solemn and sacred obligations to God and man . 

sense of honour or duty you can have none , since you have neither fear of God , nor reverence of man . 

estates you have little or none to hazard or loose upon any forfeiture of your faith or agreement : and for your heads and lives they are now so vile and cheap , that although you are not fit to live , yet they are scarce worth the taking . 

Sure you cannot but appear to yourselves as well as to all men , the most outlawed , notorious and stigmatised re•elss , the most perfidious traitors that ever any King , or senate , state or persons employed or trusted : having utterly blotted out all your former promeritings and good service so much boasted of ; since the event proclaims you served not King , parliament , or co•ntrey , but your own lusts and villainous designs , which by the advantages of mutinous power you now seek to accomplish under the now void and forfeited commission of that stupid saint , that stain of honour , that dumb show of your silent , extatick and seduced general the poor and unexcellent Lord 

So that the darkening of your most wicked designs by this title of the agreement of the persons , amounts to no more in the true and last sense of it , but this , that you would have the persons of England , and the other two united kingdoms , willingly to bow down to your hoddy dody ; your all breech-idol , as your own prophet so variously and falsely inspired , justly calls your unlicked and monstrous projects , not of government , but of anarchy and tyranny . 

You would have us all to pledge you in that horrible draught of the King's blood , which you have greedily drank ; to approve and ab•• your execrable villainies ; and to submit for ever to the intolerable tyranny of such Goths , Vandals , and Saracens as you are . 

Who are but the devil's lieutenants ; factors for the god of this impure world ; signal antichrists , accurate fulfillers of all the characters foretold , and brands set upon you in the last and perilous times ; in which true glass you and all men May clearly see the ugly lineaments of your most deformed faces and manners . 

It is hoped , that God hath yet so much mercy left in store for these sinful ( And by you most miserable ) kingdoms ; as he gives us grace utterly to abhor your desperate sins•• so that we trust he will never suffer us by a devilish apostasy to fall from all vows , oaths , and covenants to God and man , by which we and our posterity are bound to God , the crown , and our Countrie• ; only to have yours and the d•vils' absolution , to m•ke a cove••nt and agreement with hell and death ; with your most irreligious •nd damnable designs and practices . 

No , the sin and horror of your ways are now like Absaloms' incestuous and noonday rapes , discovered in the sight of the sun and all the world ; nor will the s•btilty of your soft and feigned voices like Sirens any more charm , and enchant the honest persons of England , into such beasts and monsters , •s yourselves are ; to whose hell•sh deformities you would have a•l others to conform : they have seen and felt too much already of your cruel hypocr•sieses ; your devilish and strong delusions . 

Have not your words been always soloecisms to your purposes and your practices contradictions to your pretences ? 

Have you not as much as lies in your power and mal•ce cast us into the dead sea of disloyalty , perjury , cruelty , barbarity , irreligion , and confusion , that is possible for any nation suddenly to relapse and fall into , after so many sacred and solemn professions of loyalty , and reformation to God and the world , whom we called to w•tness upon our souls ? 

Agreeable to all which , and to fill up the measure of our sins , as if our rebellion against God and the King were hitherto but a light and small matter , by which we have most unhappily occasioned his death , by the hands of cruel edomites and cursed amal•kiteses as you are ; which most deplorable calamity to us and this na•ion we penitently look upon as the severest temporal st•oke which the wrath of God , gone out against us , can infl•ct upon us . Yet your impudent hypocrisy now seeks to obtrude upon us your wretched and abhorred agreement ; the sum of which is to leave the kingdom without a King ; government without authority ; magistrates without power ; a persons without laws ; a body without an head ; sheep without a shepherd ; Christians without Christ ; churches without ministers ; ministers without maintenance ; a nation without fai•h : in a word , you would have us live as men without souls , without God ; wilfully degenerating to beasts , without sense of virtue or vice , shame or honour ; without fear of hell , hopes of heaven , or thoughts of eternity ; and all this to maintain a few tyrannous hypocrites , and sodomitick saints , the cry of whose sins like Sodom is gone up to heaven , and are a burden too heavy for the earth to bear ; have you not already made the name of these Pretestant and reform•d churches to stink among •ll na•ionss both Christian and heathen , through the dead flies , and •ot en••ss of your principles and manners . 

Have you not •urp 〈◊〉 the cunning and c•uelt• o• t•• most ••su•tick h•a•ss a•d 〈◊〉 •s ••ch as you 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 o•  an•  to adu••ce  above that of Kings : but you upon base principles seek to subject the regal sovereignty to that of the persons , as you call it ; nor that you mean so in good earnest , further than to delude the persons , and to raise the heads of your desperate faction above all , both King , Prince , peers and persons . 

We appeal to all sober Christians , whether your treasons have not far surpassed the powder conspiracy ; inasmuch , as they plotted secretly , but you have peracted openly , the murder of the King , the ruin of all the royal issue ; the overthrow of all our laws ; the blowing up of all parliaments ; the subverting of the whole state and government ; the devastation of your country ; the abolition of all true religion ; the extirpation of all liberty , peace , order , and humanity . 

Your elder brother Faux himself Might seem a saint compared to you : whose new light , and dark lantern you have so long made use of to hide and disguise your desperate intentions : nor were the rest of those powder traitors so criminal as you , if they had effected what they designed ; since they neither pr•tended to that saintsh•p , or that smooth precisen•sse which you have done ; nor had they upon them such signal ties of public and special trust ( Besides your many voluntary obligations ) the total violation of all which , renders your sins out of measure sinful , and your treasons incomparably traitorous : beyond what any ca•elines but yourselves , ever had the desperate boldness to have conceived or committed . 

Had you been our open enemies , or self-raising rebels in a declared r•valry and enmity against King , parliament and country , we could either have prevented and opposed you ; or have born with less shame and disdain your insolent and prevayling cruelties against them all . 

But when we consider what ostentation and show you made of exact obedience and plenary a•quiescence in their votes , results , and orders , from whom you had your unhappy commission ; also of loyal regard to his majesty's safety , rights , honour and posterity , ( To whom some of your chief commanders ( As they well know ) engaged their souls , as much as was possible for any mortal men to do , devoting themselves to all the curses of God , t•mporall and etern•ll upon the breach and failer of their words to his ma•esty . 

Add to these the fair gloseings you made at your first meeting , of speedy and impartial endeavou•s to settle all things in peace , justice , due l•berty and piety ; which how faithfully you have effected , the present deplored state of this church and state May witness ; whose face is now miserably squalled and hideously besmeared with the blood of the King , and those most indelible reproaches wherewith you have blasphemed our god , our King , and our religion . 

We the persons of England , of all sorts , Lords , gentry , clergy and Commons , do again and again declare to God and all the world , the present age and posterity so long as the world shall endure , our infinite abhorrence , utter detestation , and to•all d•sagre•ment from what you the officers of the army ; and your most slavish , ever infamous and unparliamentary juncto have already done , or shall further do , ( Through God's vengeance upon this nation ) in prosecution of your never sufficiently abominated villainies . 

Nor do we desire any thing more of the just and alm•ghty God , ( Not in order to the sati•faction of our private ma••ce , or desire of revenge on any of you ( Though our par•icular injuries hav• been many from you ) but o••y in order to the publiqu• vindication of Go•s' glory , the ho•our of the reform•d religion , the loyalty , faith and credit of this nat•on , the wiping away those foul sins of tr••s•n , perjury , truce-breaking and regal parricide , ( In all which villainies your execrable faction , wallowing in the blood of your King and fellow-subjects now seek impenitently and irreparably to implunge this whole nation ; ) that we m•ght ( As some solace under our immense sorrows , and tyrannising miseri•ss infl•cted by you ) but live to see God's temporal judgements so far upon you , as May pull down your Lucif•rian pride , and make your obstinate minds to see the horror of your villainies ; that like Cain , you May be afraid of all men ; like Judas , accursed to all posterity ; given over to Sa•an , and excommunicated by all good chris••anss , as murderers of your father , killers of your King ; that you May ever be ha•ted with the r•full ghost , and hideous phantasm of the King , whom you have trayterousl• butchered : that the exemplary vengeance of God May be upon you and your adherents so rema•kably , and in such a proportion to your villainies , that if there be any place left for repentance , you May find it ; and yet all the world May see , your destruction is the Lord's doing , and say , doubtless , there is a God that judgeth the earth . 

Nor do we despair , but God will upon our true repentance for our great sins and sup•ne folly ( Which gave you advantages to fulfil your most odious villainies ) so far remember his mercies to this most deplorable kingdom , and by you ( As so many wild boars ) desolated churches , as to stir up some powerful avenger of the King's blood ; and all that other innocent blood , which the depths and dece•tss at first , the force and violence afterward , o• your bloody faction hath occasioned and caused to be shed ; by your tumultuating the persons ; your instigating the spirits of the two houses with false and panic fears ; your calumniating the King , and perverting his gracious purposes ; your enflaming the enmities , and heightening the animosities on both sides ; your fraudulently voting , no addresses , and publishing that lying and most infamous libel for your pretended grounds ; your widening the differences , and hindering all fair equable closings , both formerly , and in that last memorable treaty at Newport ; of which you were the most rude , savage and perfidious violators , that ever history recorded . 

We know , that you can now only trust in your arm of flesh , in the devil's aid and council , having in your works denied the living god ; instead of whom , your belly and the present world , are become your god and your glory : for the satisfaction of which , and the attaining places of profit and power ( Agreeable to your lusts , which are enlarged like hell ) you have dared to advance thus far to the destroying of King , parliament and laws ; which were the only boundaries and conservers of our peace , Properti•s , liu•s and liberties ; yet after all this , you inscribe on your bloody banners , and impudent foreheads , the agreement of the persons ; and the restorers of our liberties . 

Which plots , although you think them your masterpieces for artifice , juggling and policy ( That so you Might by fair words and flattering lies , allure the many and meaner persons to maintain those monsters which you have brought forth ) yet you must know , that the persons of engl•ndss eyes are not so bloodshot , nor their consciences so seared , nor their hearts so disloyal , nor their senses so bewitched by your magic and charms , as not to see through , and fully both discover and detest your devilish designs of tyranny , anarchy and profanen•sse , whereto you drive , through all these cloudings of immethodical nonsense , and indigested scribblings ; which like your late damnable remonstrance and your other illiterate and irrational papers discover ; that where there is so much want of grace and common honesty as in you , it is impossible not to want •ven those shows of common sense and vulgar reason , which are n•cessary ( Not to justify ( Which no tongue , pen or wit of devils can do ) but so far as to palliate your filth , and cover your nakednesse• or to render your wicked projects but tole••bly plausible to those , that have the grossest perception of things . 

The better to temper this your cup of deadly poison , to please the vulgar relish ( Which you think is gross and undecerning ) you tempt them with the name of liberty ; first in civil things ; which all men see is but a mere cheat , while they are l•ke to be held under your iron hands , and squeezed under your tyrannous wills , and int•lerable exactions ; instead of in•o•ing the benefit of our ancient and famous laws ( The best that any subjects in the world enjoyed , the ju•t and only bo••dss of our liberti•ss , and conserver• of our both pe•ce and p•osperitieses ; to which all ••n•st men ( Who have no jo•n• stock with you in k••very , pou•rty and baseness ) desire most humbly and •arnestly •o return ; d••pairing ( An• w•t• good cause• that •u•r their l•b•rtieses and p•ope•tieses can be either a•vanced or def••ded b• y•u , who have been so insol•nt u•u•pe•s over King , parliament , and all our la•ss and liberties ; which o•r forefathers indeed •njoyed m•ny years , through god••l•ssing and •h• fatherly care of their p••nc•ss , to a g•ea•e• measure of peace , plen•y and pie•y , •hen ever can be hoped for under such bloody l•echeses , such n•merous and unsatiable caterpillars , as we have felt you to be : n•y , we tell you , we so far disdain , your hypocrisy , treachery and tyranny , that we had rather be under the tyranny of our rightful King ( Of whose justice and clemency we nothing doubt ) then owe our liberty , as you call it , to such vile mushrooms and detested traitors as you are ; who boast of liberty , yet are indeed slaves to your damned and desperate lusts ; studying nothing but how to delude the persons with the name and fancy of liberty ; as if you would persuade us rather to be the devil's freemen , as you are , ( Led captaive by his will ) then to be loyal subjects to our lawful and most hopeful King ; or hum•le servants to God , whose sacred ties are many w•yeses upon our souls , binding us to fear God , and to honour the King ; and no less to abhor you ; and have no fellowship with such as are given to seditious or perjurious changes : forbidding us to use our liberty , as men and Christians , for a cloak off maliciousness , perjury , tyranny , hypocrisy , and all licentious villainies , as you have done . 

The next pretence wherewith you bait the mousetrap , and temper the ratsbane of your agreement , is that of liber•y in religion ; your meaning is ; that men May be free to profess no religion ; or any which they call such , so it be not the true one ; which you know is most opposite to your seditious , traitorous , merciless , uncharitable and bloody superstitions : the very truth is ; you aim at such an intolerable toleration in religion , as you think is most agreeable to the profane hearts , and licentious manners of the most debauched lives and atheistical spirits , with which you have already pestered this English world . 

In order to this truth-darkning , and soul-damning design , we know you follow your leader the devil , and his lieutenant general , to the utter dissolving of all government , order , and discipline in the church , to discourage all learned , godly and painful ministers ; to rob and spoil them of all settled maintenance ; to reduce them and the work of the ministry to that contempt , which in the pride and luxury of these times follows poverty and beggary ; that they depending on the people's good will and charity , ( Which in many you have made bad and cold enough toward the best and ablest preachers ) or upon your insolent and niggardly stipends , they and their families May either eat their own dung , and drink their own piss ; or be forced by necessities of life to desert their function and places ; so as to leave their congregations destitute of all holy public duties ; or expose them to those military wolves and mechanic foxes , which you have in great store provided for the supply of all places , in church as well as state . 

Thus doth your rage reach as high as heaven , and as low as hell : but we hope the god of heaven will look down upon us , and our children in mercy , and by some speedy rebuke of such Satans not suffer your folly and fury to proceed any further , it being manifest to all moral and sober men , that you are factors not only for yourselves , to devour our estates , houses , lands , liberties , peace , and lives ; but like the great dragon , you pour forth a sea off blood and poison , ignorance , and profaneness , such as May for ever drown both our and our children's souls in heathenish barbarism , superstition , atheism , and eternal destruction . 

But know oh you neither millstones , you poisonous asps , you king-killing-basilisks , you desperate deceivers and damnably deceived : that although you have against all faith of Turks , Jews , or any heathens , by fraud and force usurped upon our secular and civil liberties ; so that at present we have not any form power to oppose you , and call your ringleaders to a seu•re accou•t for your unheard of crimes and injuries against our King and our coun•rey . Yet sh•ll our constancy in , and our suffe•ing for our rel•gion , and our encouragement of godly , learned and faithful ministers , to our best abilities , make the world to see , that there is no agreement between Christ in us , and Belial in you ; our god , and your Mammon . 

We hope the triumphing of such hypocrites as you are , is but short ; nor shall you long insult over the dead and divided corpse of our late Lord and sovereign King ; whose wisdom , piety , faith , and patience God ( We doubt not ) hath crowned with glory and immortality ; having perfected those many princely gifts and divine graces in him ( As God often doth in his dearest saints and martyrs , after the example of his crucified son Jesus Christ ) by his sufferings and your cruelties ; whose memory and posterity will be ever dear , precious , and honoured , to us and our succeeding generations as a King ; who now appears , beyond the errors and jealousies of former Surmi•eses •chiefly raised and fomented by your false and envious faction ) to have been the most constant pil•ar , the noblest patron , the resolutest protector , and he most patient martyr for our laws , liberties , lives , and religion : yea and of our parliaments true privileges ; which his m•jesty best saw , and fullest declare• at first to have been shamefully invaded and out-raged by your tumults , after by your armies , next by your new modellings , at last by actual mutinings , impude•t menaces , violent and warlike impressions upon their safety , liberty , faith , loyalty and honour , with which purposes you sometime falsely aspersed , and afterward accused the King : and for which calumnies you most unjustly condemned and traitorously murdered him ; yourselves being most truly and notoriously guilty of that , for which you wickedly , cruelly and injustly destroyed your and our King . Shall you escape the righteous judgement of God ? Will not God visit you for these things ? shall he not be avenged of such 〈◊〉 hypocrites ? 

•or is it without a special providence , that you should be left wholly naked and d•stitute of all pretended du• authority in the fulfilling your ex•crable vill•nieses , to which you would now fain invite the persons of England , not having any sh•w or colour of any parliamentary votes , authority , •r commands to countenance •our mischiefs , murthe•ss , and tyran•••ss , not any concurrence of either Lords or Commons ; whom now under force , and without all freedom ( Becoming either gentlemen or Christians ) we must tell you , we look upon as no house ; and their enforced or enslaved votes as null ; their after sittings and complyings with you , being nothing but infamous and base prostitutings of the honour of that house , and vassallatings of the dignity and liberty both of the parliament and persons of England , to the tyranny of a few mutinous cutthroats , traitorous rebels , and bloody schismatics ; who are in no sense to be Counted the persons of England ; any more than scabs , or plague-sores , or leprosy , or putrid ulcers , and noisome excrements are to be ••puted any part of the body , whose grief , burden and annoyance they are . 

So that unless you can flatter yourselves to have done well and worthily in all you have cru•lly , insolently and traiterou•ly acted against King , lo•dss , Commons , gentry , clergy and all honest men . 

Unless you can propound something to recompense the inestimable injuries you have done to all estates in these three kingdoms , as in other acts of your tyranny and treason , so chiefly in that unparalleled villainy of murdering such a King , and depriving us of so incomparable a Prince , for wisdom , piety , gravity , patience , magnanimity , courage , constancy , charity , and all other virtues most adorning a man a King and a christia• ( The loss of whom all 〈◊〉 lives of you and your approvers cannot countervayl or expiate , being but as so many dog's heads to such a boon . ) 

Unless you can stop the mouths of all men , or cut their throats , or sea• their consciences , or persuade them to damn their souls , for your sakes to gratify a few c•uterised consciences , bloody and ambitious spirits among you . 

You cannot but hear the sound of much vengeance coming upon you , to which your own black souls summon you , and which your own consciences will in the first place silently , but yet severely execute upon you . 

Nor will your seeming smiles , and forced confidences , nor yet the applauses of your sordid flatterers , and desperate confederates , nor yet the assistance of your numerous and deluded soldiers , be able to exempt you from that storm of fire and brimstone , that pit , s•are , curse and hell , which pursues you , and is ready to overtake you . 

How can such Zimri's , who have so traitorously slain such a King , their Lord and Master , ever hope to have peace or impunity in this or the other world ? Since the justice of divine providence ( In a case where his name was not blasphemed , and so his glory not so concerned as in this , ( Of your murdering so lawful and so Christian a King ) suffered not any of the murderers of Julius Caesar , who was but an usurper , to die other than a violent and immature death . Nor will ( We hope ) our Solomon by God's blessing and his subjects assistance , suffer the hairy scalps of those who were the chief counsellors and actors in destroying his dear father , and our dread sovereign , to go down to the grave in peace , or to die a dry death ; who have shed the blood of war , in a time when all differences were by a treaty drawn to a peace and union . 

We can never think , that a Babel of so confused a fashion , of such a headlong height , as yours is ; such a toads-stool suddenly grown out of the earth of beggary and ignorance , by fraud and cruelty , lately watered with the blood of the King and his subjects , can long thrive or stand ; having no foundation in the world , or any show of reason , equity , honour , peace , liberty or piety to support it . Not any seeming authority ( For due and legal you could have none upon earth . ) Not any general desire , delight , consent or agreement , in what you have done , or propound further to do ; but rather a general detestation , an utter abhorrence , and a perfect hatred of you and your deeds ; which honest men will then agree to , and subscribe , when they can be content to love death and hell , or to hate God and their own souls . 

Nor doubt we , but many of those soldiers , whose valour and simplicity you have thus far grossly abused by engaging them in such desperate assistances ( Whose profit will redound to but few or none of them , ) when their Christian , penitent and smiting hearts shall come to see ( As no doub• many of them already do , who are not thoroughly poisoned with your desperate principles ) to what horrid villainies they are made gossips and accessary by your fraud and hypocrisy , they will speedily return from you , dead dogs , desperate Sheba's , and cursing Shimei's ; whose mouths and hearts are full of the gall of bitterness , whose hands and feet are swift to shed blood , who know not the way of peace , nor have any fear of God before your eyes ; whose curse is to boast yourselves in your iniquity ; to fall from one wickedness to another , till eternal vengeance seize upon you . 

Penitently smiting their breasts , as those that came from crucifying Christ Jesus , ( A work proportionate to the malice and cruelty of you our King's murderers , our barabbasses ) whose barbarity hath at once deprived the King of what is wont to be dearest to men , his life and his kingdoms ; robbing his subjects , the Christian world , and all mankind , of the greatest glory , and most illustrious example of virtue and piety that ever sat upon a Christian throne ; the most unspotted person , the wisest •rince , the most charitable Christian , the most imitable pattern for moderation in prosperity , for patience in adversity , for devout humility toward God , for judicious zeal to true religion , for constant love to the church , for winning majesty upon all men , that ever swayed the sceptre of this or any other kingdom ; accessible in his brightest splendour , magnanimous in his greatest diminutions ; of a thriving and victorious virtue under the heavyest pressures and crosses ; w•ose excellent skill was never so much discovered as in the late storms ; whose darkenings rendered him not less formidable to his enemies , or less venerable to his friends• nor was he ever more terrible to those , that are perfect haters of God , of him , and of all goodness than when they saw , that the eminency of his virtues was not to be smothered by their calumnious expressions ; but the beams and lustre of divine majesty in him daily conquered all eclipsings that either his own misfortunes or your malice cast upon him . 

This was the man , this the Christian , this the King , this the saint , this the martyr , whom these Judas' have betrayed , these •ewes destroyed , these cannibals devoured . 

A sin questionless exceeding in many respects that of Christ's crucifiers , ( Not as to the dignity of the person , wherein Christ infinitely surpassed the majesty as well as merit of all earthly Kings ) but as to that eminency of civil dignity and sovereignty , wherewith the King from God was invested ; which Christ Jesus never assumed , contenting himself with the form of a servant , and subjecting h•mself to civil magistracy . Also in regard of that malice , hypocrisy and pretenslesse cruelty , which these monsters showed against the King , destitute of any show of due authority ; which the crucifiers of our saviour wanted not ; urging also a law they had , by which they said , ( Though falsely ) he ought to die : what law the King's murderers either produced or pretended to justify their authority , their accusations , or their sentence against , and execution upon the King , we and they are yet to learn ; nor is it possible they ever should ; since all• our laws do most fully and cleary declare the person of the King , as supreme , sacred , unaccountable , inviolable by any person , process , judgement or punishment on earth . 

When the soldiery by sea and land shall once seriously reflect upon and consider the infinite odious aggravations , wherewith this horrid murder of such a man , such a Prince , and their lawful King , is laden ( To which villainy , their valour was abused , to be only as bloodhounds , butchers , and hangmen ) no doubt they will conceive so just and generous a disdain , that no men's hands will be more ready to avenge their own dishonour , the shame of their profession , the wound and stayn of their consciences , the blood of their King , the dignity of parliaments , and the loyalty of their nation , ( Never so branded in any fo•mer age ) than those soldiers , whose valour you the Achitophel's , jeroboam's , Haman's and ma•hiavelss of our times have basely abused , only to serve you in accomplishing your execrable villainies , and to preserve you from just and speedy vengeance ; which ( As Severus said to those villains and traitors , who had murdered their Emperor Pertinax ) can neither be invented for you , nor executed upon you , proportionable to the many and outrageous villainies committed by you . 

We the persons of Engla•d , cannot but appeal to God , your own consciences , ( Such as they are , cauterised and polluted with the blood of our King ) also to the judgement of all men , that have but common sober sense , whether any age , any monuments of former times , any history of human affairs , have ever recorded any excess of riot , any superfluity of wickedness to have ever flowed from the hearts of any men , or have been f•lfilled parallel to yours ? Whether any combination of desperate men , filled with the quintessence of all wickedness , fraught with flattery , cruelty , hypocrisy , tyranny , and all degrees of malicious villainy , incident to human nature , have since the world began , and mankind hath been planted upon the earth , ever committed the like villainies ( Which exceed all names of vice and infamy ) or ever more deserved to be made a public curse , and universal execration to all mankind , to have their persons cut off from the face of the earth , and buried with the burial of an ass ; to have their posterity , as a pes•ilent progeny spewed out of the land , ( Unless they fully declare their unfeigned and utter abhorrence of their father's villainies , who have defiled the land with the blood of the King ; ) that their houses •which are neither great nor many ) May be razed ; that their memories May be blotted out from under heaven , or only remembered with perpetual scorn , cursing and infamy . 

Since they have besides many other preparatory mischiefs , by murdering the King , disinheriting his posterity , and dissolving this ancient and flourishing monarchy , ( As far as lies in their power and malice ) put us upon this miserable choice ; either cowardly , basely and shamefully to submit to their detestable and unsatiable tyranny ; or to be ever oppressed with a war in our own bowels ; in which we must either expose our lives and fortunes to these men's covetous cruelty , or help to enslave and destroy ourselves by assisting these usurpers ; or compel the rightful heir of these kingdoms , our hopeful King Charles the second , to plead and assert his right by a foreign sword ; being denied that just assistance , which as his subjects we ought to afford him against the murderers of his and our country's father ; his own enemies , and indeed of all kingly majesty , and mankind ; the Dissolvers of our •arliamentss , the oppressors of our liberties , the exhausters of our estates , the suckers of our blood , the blasphemers of our religion , the damners of our souls ( Unless God preserve us , ) the crucifiers afresh of the Lord of glory , and putting him to open shame . 

The cry of the blood of our King , the voice of the genius of this nation , and the alarm of God's justice , call aloud to all honest men of foreign nations round about ; to all loyal subjects in these three kingdoms , to all men of any common honesty or sober profession of religion in all the world ; summoning them to san••ifie themselves , and lustrate and expiate not only this English nation and these three kingdoms , but all mankind , and civil societies , by taking speedy vengeance , and executing gods and man's severest justice on these per•idious truce-breakers , proud usurpers , cruel hypocrites , traitorous apostates , and barbarous king-killers . 

We cannot but send the divided parts of our dead but endeared King , now a glorious saint , ( Whom these men have with subtlety and cruelty lately murdered ) to all the tribes of this our Israel , to desire the advice of all good men , to see and consider , whether this hideous villainy were committed with their consent , or deserve to be patronised with their agreement ; whether it was ever thus done in any Christian nation or kingdom , by any army of pretending saints , or any men , we say not of common honesty , but of the most exquisite and studied villainy : whether any thing can be produced out of common principles of sound reason , out of the laws of God , out of Christ's holy precepts , out of the actions and examples of any holy and good men ; or lastly , out of any letter , sense or meaning of our laws , whereby in the least degree to countenance , cover or excuse the actions of these men ; or to satisfy any man's conscience , that doth not utterly abhor and seriously endeavour to expiate the sin and guilt of such detestable villainies . 

According to the heaped and overrunning measure of their open sins , and abominable villainies , so let every good man , that fears God , knows the memory and virtues of so good a King , loves his country , will keep a good conscience , and desires to save his own soul , not only withdraw all voluntary assistance from them , least they seem approvers of their wicked deeds , and be partakers of their gild and judgements ; but heartily pray , and constantly endeavour the restoring of the crowns and kingdoms to the only lawful heir , the late King's elder son , upon whom are many happy presages , and great expectations of glorious achievements ; whom God hath in mercy , we hope , to these churches and kingdoms , preserved out of the hands of these bloody villains , who declared in their devilish remonstrance , their purpose to destroy him , with his brother the Duke of York , and mingle their tender bloods with that of their father ; whom special providence hath prepared for great and excellent designs , by the maturity of his years , by the procerity of his person , by the gallantry of his spirit , by the excellency of his understanding , by the gravity of his manners , and severity of his example , far beyond what is wont or expected in young men , or young Princes in point of piety and virtue . 

This is that person , this that Prince , worthy of his high descent , worthy of such a father , whose worth already promises to exceed all you can desire or hope for from a good and gracious King ; upon him God , and our laws , and our oaths , commands all loyal and religious subjects to fix their eyes , to unite their hearts and hands to the love and assistance of him , to expiate the sin and shame of their former errors and defaults , which have produced such sad and abhorred effects ; to break the strength , to extirpate the persons , to oppose the designs , •nd to revenge the villainies , which have been with an high hand committed against God , the King , the parliament , the laws , and the kingdoms , by these miscreants , men always of desperate fortunes , but now of so desperate minds and manners , that all their paths lead to the chambers of death , and their steps are descending to the pit of hell . 

From which the Lord in mercy deliver the persons of this nation , by prospering our rightful 〈◊〉 and by his valour and virtues , r•deeming us speedily from the sins , sufferings and tyrannies of these bloodthirsty and deceitful men ; with whom no agreement can be made by any man , who doth not desperately resolve to sin against the holy ghost , and eternally damn his own soul . 

rom. 16. 17.  now we beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine you have learned , and avoid them . 

18.  for they that are such , serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own bellies , and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
