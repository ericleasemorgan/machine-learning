An humble remonstrance to the high court of parliament . 

Most honourable Lords , and ye the knights , citizens and burgesses , of the honourable house of Commons ; 

Lest the world should think the press had of late forgot to speak any language other then libellous , this honest paper hath broken through the throng , and prostrates itself before you : how meanly soever , and unattended , it presents itself to your view , yet it comes to you on a great errand , as the faithful messenger of all the peaceable and right-affected sons of the church of England ; and in their names , humbly craves a gracious admittance : had it regarded the pomp and ostentation of names , it Might have gloried in a train past number ; it is but a poor stock that May be Counted ; million of hands ( If that tumultuary , and underhand way of procured subscriptions could have reason to hope for favour in your eyes ) shall at your least command , give attestation to that , which this scroll doth in their names humbly tender unto you . 

Ye are now happily ( Through God's blessing ) met in a much-longed-for parliament ; it were but a narrow word to say that the eyes of all us the good subjects of the whole realm are fixed upon your success ; certainly there are not more eyes in these three interessed kingdoms , then are now bent upon you ; yea all the neighbour churches and kingdoms , if i May not say the whole Christian world , and , no small part beyond it , look wishly upon your faces , and with stretched-out necks gaze at the issue of your great meeting ; neither doubt we but since sovereign authority hath for this purpose both summoned , and actuated you , you will not fail to produce something worthy of so high an expectation . 

Ye are the sanctuary , whereto now every man flees , whether really , or pretendedly distressed ; even a Joab or Adonijah will be also taking hold of the horns of the altar : your noble wisdoms know how to distinguish of men and actions , and your inviolable justice knows to award each his own . 

Many things there are doubtless , which you find worthy of a seasonable reformation , both in church and state . Neither can it be otherwise , but that in a pampered full body , diseases will grow through rest . Ponds that are seldom scoured will easily gather mud ; metals , rust ; and those patients that have enured themselves to a set course of medicinal evacuations , if they intermit their springs and falls , fall into feverous distempers ; not , that supreme , and immediately-subordinate authority hath in the mean time been wanting to its charge ; surely , unless we would suppose Princes to be gods , we cannot think they can know all things : of necessity they must look with others eyes , and hear with others ears , and be informed by others tongues , and act by others hands ; and when all is done , even the most regular , and carefullyinquisitive state is not like the sun , from whose light and heat nothing is hide . 

It cannot be expected that those constellations which attend the Southern pole , should take view of our hemisphere , or intermix their influences with those above our heads ; every agent is required , and allowed to work within the compass of its own activity : ye therefore , who by the benefit of your dispersed habitations , enjoy the advantage of having the whole kingdom , and all the corners of it within your eyes , May both clearly see all those enormities , wherewith any part is infested , ( Unknown to remoter intelligence ) and can best judge to apply meet remedies thereunto . Neither can it be , but that those eyes of yours , which have been privately vigilant , within the places of your several abodes , must needs ( Not without much regret ) in this your public meeting , take notice of the miserable disorders of so many vicious and misaffected persons , as have thrust themselves upon your cognizance . 

While the orthodox part in this whole realm , hath ( To the praise of their patience ) been quietly silent , as securely conscious of their own right , and innocence , how many furious and malignant spirits everywhere have burst forth into sclanderous libels , bitter Pasquines' , railing pamphlets ? ( Under which more presses than one have groaned ) wherein they have endeavoured , through the sides of some misliked persons , to wound that sacred government , which ( By the joint-confession of all reform divines ) derives itself from the times of the blessed apostles , without any interruption , ( Without the contradiction of any one congregation in the Christian world ) unto this present age ; wherein , as no doubt their lewd boldness hath been extremely offensive to your wisdoms , and piety , so May it please you to check this daring , and misgrounded insolence of these libelers , and by some speedy declaration to let the world know , how much you detest this their malicious , or ignorant presumption ; and by some needful act to put a present restraint upon the wild and lawless courses of all their factious combinations abroad , and enterprises of this kind . 

And if you find it pass for one of the main accusations against some great persons , now questioned before you , that they endeavoured to alter the form of the established government of the commonwealth ; how can these pamphleteers seem worthy of but an easy censure , which combine their counsels and practices , for the changing of the settled form of the government of the church ? Since , if antiquity May be the rule , the civil polity hath sometimes varied , the sacred , never ; and if original authority May carry it ; that came from arbitrary imposers , this , from men inspired , and from them in an unquestionable clearness derived to us : and if those be branded for incendiaries , which are taxed of attempting to introduce new forms of administration , and rules of divine worship into our neighbour church , how shall those boute-feux of ours escape , that offer to do these offices to our own ? the several , and daily variable projects whereof , are not worthy of your knowledge , or our confutation ; let me have leave to instance in two , the prime subjects of their quarrel , and contradiction ; liturgy , and episcopacy . 

The liturgy of the church of England hath been hitherto esteemed sacred , reverently used by holy martyrs , daily frequented by devout Protestant's , as that , which more than once hath been allowed and confirmed by the edicts of religious Princes , and by your own parliamentary acts ; and but lately , being translated into other languages , hath been entertained abroad , with the great applause of foreign divines and churches ; yet , now , begins to complain of scorn at home : the matter is quarrelled by some , the form by others , the use of it by both : that which was never before heard of in the church of God , whether Jewish , or Christian , the very prescription of the most holy devotion offendeth . Surely , our blessed saviour , and his gracious forerunner , were so far from this new divinity , as that they plainly taught that , which these men gainsay ; a direct form of prayer ; and such , as that part of the frame prescribed by our saviour , was composed of the forms of devotion then formerly usual ; and God's persons ever since Moses his days , constantly practised it ; and put it over unto the times of the gospel ; under which , while it is said that Peter and John went up to the temple at the ninth hour of prayer , we know the prayer wherewith they joined was not of an extemporary , and sudden conception , but of a regular prescription ; the forms whereof are yet extant , and ready to be produced ; and the evangelical church , ever since , thought it could never better improve her peace , and happiness , then in composing those religious models of invocation and thanksgiving ; which they have traduced unto us : and can ye then with patience think , that any ingenuous Christian should be so far mis-transported , as to condemn a good prayer , because , as it is in his heart , so it is in his book too ? Far be it from me to dishearten any good Christian from the use of conceived prayer , in his private devotions ; and upon occasion also , in the public ; i would hate to be guilty of pouring so much water upon the spirit , to which i shall gladly add oil rather ; no , let the full soul freely pour out itself in gracious expressions of its holy thoughts , into the bosom of the almighty : let both the sudden flashes of our quick ejaculations , and the constant flames of our more fixed conceptions mount up from the altar of a zealous heart , unto the throne of grace ; and if there be some stops or solecisms in the fervent utterance of our private wants , these are so far fro being offensive , that they are the most pleasing music to the ears of that God , unto whom our prayers come : let them be broken off with sobs , and sighs , and incongruities of our delivery , our good God is no otherwise affected to this imperfect elocution , than an indulgent parent is to the clipped , and broken language of his dear child , which is more delightful to him then any others smooth oratory ; this is not to be opposed in another , by any man that hath found the true operation of this grace in himself : but in the mean time , let the public forms of the sacred church-liturgy have its due honour ; let this , by the power of your authority be reinforced , as that which being selected , out of ancient models , ( Not Roman , but Christian ) and contrived by the holy martyrs , and confessors of the blessed reformation of religion , hath received abundant supply of strength , both from the zealous recommendation of four most religious Princes , and your own most firm and peremptory establishment ; amongst which powerful inducements , that is worthy of no slight consideration , which i humbly tender unto you , from the judgement of the learnedest King that ever sat upon this throne , or ( As i verily think ) since Solomon's time , upon any other ; King James of blessed memory , who ( However misalleged by some , as letting fall disgraceful speeches concerning this subject ) after a solemn hearing of those exceptions , which were taken by some against this open form of commonprayer , ( As it is called in Queen Elizabeth's act for uniformity ) shuts up in his proclamation given at Westminster , the fifth of March , in the first year of his reign , with these words ; and last of all , we admonish all men , that hereafter they shall not expect or attempt any farther alteration into the common and public form of God's service , from this , which is now established ; for that , neither will we give way to any , to presume , that our own judgement having determined in a matter of this weight , shall be swayed to alteration , by the frivolous suggestion of any light spirit ; neither are we ignorant of the inconveniences that do arise in government , by admitting innovation in things once settled by mature deliberation : and how necessary it is to use constancy in the upholding of the public determinations of states ; for that such is the unquietness , and unsteadfastness of some dispositions , affecting every year new forms of things , as , if they should be followed in their unconstancy , would make all actions of state , ridiculous and contemptible ; whereas the steadfast maintaining of things , by good advise established , is the weal of all commonwealths . 



Thus , that great oracle of wisdom , and learning , whom i beseech you suppose , that you still hear directing this prudent and religious advise to your present ears ; and consider how requisite it is for you , out of the reason both of state , and piety , to rest in that his sound , and exquisite judgement . As for those particularities of exceptions which have been taken by some at certain passages of that book , they have more than once received full satisfaction , by other pens : let me only say thus much , that were the readers but as charitable , as the contrivers were religiously devout ; those quarrels had either never been raised , or had soon died , alone : oh suffer not then , i beseech you , this holy form of God's service , to be exposed to the proud contempt of ignorant , and ill-affected persons ; maintain , and bear up the pious acts of your godly predecessors , yea , make good your own : and if our holy martyrs heretofore went to heaven with a litany in their mouth ; let not an ill advised newfangleness be suffered to put scorn upon that , wherein they thought themselves happy . 

As for that form of episcopal government , which hath hitherto obtained in the church of God , i confess , i am confounded in myself , to hear with what unjust clamours , it is cried down abroad , by either weak , or factious persons ; of either , or both which , i May well take up that word of our saviour , father forgive them , for they know not what they do : surely , could those look with my eyes , they would see cause to be thoroughly ashamed of this their injurious misconceit ; and should be forced to confess , that never any good cause had more reason to complain of a wrongful prosecution ; were this ordinance merely human , and ecclesiastical , if there could no more be said for it , but that it is exceeding ancient , of more than 1500 years standing , and that it hath continue in this island , since the first plantation of the gospel , to this present day , without contradiction : a man would think this were enough plea to challenge a reverent respect , and an immunity from all thoughts of alteration ; for , even nature if self teaches us to rise up before the hoare-head ; and hath wrought in us a secret honour , even to the very outward gravity of age ; and just policy teaches us , not easily to give way to the change of those things , which long use , and many laws have firmly established , as necessary , or beneficial . 

Yea , the wisdom of the ancient Grecians went so far , as to forbid the removal of a well settled evil ; but , if religion teach us better things , and tell us , that nothing morally evil , can be settled well : and being , however , settled , had the more need to be ( After too long delay ) removed ; yet right reason , and sound experience inform us , that things indifferent , or good , having been by continuance , and general approbation well rooted in church , or state ; May not upon light grounds be pulled up : but , this holy calling fetches its pedigree higher , even from no less , then apostolical ; ( And therefore , in that right , divine ) institution ; for , although those things which the founders and prime governors of the evangelical church did , as men , went no further than their own persons , yet , what they did as apostles , is of an higher and more sacred consideration ; and , if as Apostolic men , they did , upon occasion , enact some temporary things , which were to die with , or before them , yet , those things which they ordained for the succeeding administration of the church which they should leave behind them , in all essential matters , can be no otherwise construed , then as exemplary , and perpetual . 

Now if to this text , we shall add the undoubted commentary of the apostles own practices , and to this commentary , we shall super-add the unquestionable gloss of the clear practice of their immediate succeslors , in this administration , continue in Christ's church to this very day ; what scruple can remain in any ingenuous heart ? but , if any one resolve to continue unsatisfied , in spite of reason , and all evidence of history , and will wilfully shut his eyes , with a purpose not to see the light , that man is past my cure , and almost my pity : the good god of heaven be merciful to such a miszealous obstinacy : certainly , except all histories , all authors fail us , nothing can be more plain than this truth ; out of them , we can , and do show , on whom the apostles of Christ laid their hands , with an acknowledgement and conveyance of imparity and jurisdiction ; we show what Bishops so ordained lived in the times of the apostles ; and succeeded each other , in their several charges , under the eyes and hands of the then living apostles ; we show who immediately succeeded those immediate successors , in their several sees , throughout all the regions of the Christian church ; and deduce their uninterrupted line , through all the following ages , to this present day ; and if there can be better evidence under heaven , for any matter of fact , ( And in this cause , matter of fact so derived , evinceth matter of right ) let episcopacy be for ever abandoned out of God's church ; but if these be ( As they are ) certain and irrefragable ; alas , what strange fury possesseth the minds of ignorant , unstable men , that they should thus headily desire , and sue to shake off so sacred , and well grounded an institution ! 

But i hear what they say ; it is not the office of episcopacy that displeases , but the quality : the apostles Bishops , and ours , were two ; theirs was no other than a parochial pastor , a preaching presbyter without inequality , without any rule over his brethren ; ours claims an eminent superiority , whether in a distinct order , or degree ; and a power of ordination , jurisdiction , unknown to the primitive times . Alas , alas , how good persons May be abused by misinformation ! Hear , i beseech you , the words of truth and confidence ; if our Bishops challenge any other spiritual power , than was by Apostolic authority delegated unto , and required of Timothy , and Titus , and the angels of the seven Asian churches , ( Some whereof are known to us by name ) let them be disclaimed as usurpers ; and if we do not show , out of the genuine and undeniable writings of those holy men , which lived both in the times of the apostles and some years after them , and conversed with them , as their blessed fellow-labourers , a clear and received distinction , both of the names and offices of the Bishops , presbyters , and deacons , as three distinct subordinate callings , in God's church , with an evident specification of the duty and charge belonging to each of them ; let this claimed hierarchy , be for ever hooted out of the church : and if the bounty of religious Princes have thought meet to grace this sacred function , with some accession of titles , and maintenance ; far be it from us to think , that the substance and essential parts of that calling is aught impaired , or altered , by such gracious munificence ; and , although ( As the world goes ) these honours cannot balance the contempt of those eminent places ; and that portion ( Which is now made hereditary to the church ) cannot , in the most of these dignities , ( After all deductions ) boast of any superfluity , yet ( Such as they are ) if any man have so little grace , and power of self-government , as to be puffed up with pride , or transported to an immoderation in the use of these adventitious favours ; the sin is personal , the calling free ; which May be , and is managed by others , with all humble sociableness , hospital frugality , conscionable improvement of all means and opportunities to the good of God's church . 

I May not yet dissemble , that , while we plead the divine right of episcopacy , a double scandal is taken , by men , otherwise not unjudicious , and cast upon us from the usual suggestions of some late pamphleteers ; the one , that we have deserted our former tenet , not without the great prejudice of sovereignty ; for , whereas we were wont to acknowledge the deriving of our tenure , as in fee , from the beneficent hand of Kings , and Princes ; now as either proudly , or ungratefully casting off that just dependence , and beholdingness , we stand upon the claim of our episcopacy , from a divine original ; the other , that , while we labour to defend the divine right of our episcopacy , we seem to cast a dangerous imputation upon those reform churches , which want that government ; both which , must be shortly cleared . 

The former had never been found worth objecting , if men had wisely learned to consider , how little incompatibleness there is in this case , of God's act , and the Kings ; both of them have their proper object , and extent : the office is from God ; the place , and station , and power , wherein that office is exercised , is from the King ; it is the King that gives the bishopric , it is God that makes the Bishop ; where was it ever heard of , that a sovereign Prince claimed the power of ordaining a pastor in the church ? this is derived from none , but spiritual hands : on the other side , who but Princes can take upon them , to have power to erect , and dispose of episcopal sees , within their own dominions ? It is with a King , and a Bishop , as with the patron , and the incumbent : the patron gives the benefice to his clerk , but pretends not to give him orders , that this man is a minister , he hath from his diocesan ; that he is beneficed , he hath from his patron ; while he acknowledgeth his orders from the reverend hands of his Bishop , doth he derogate aught from the bounty of a patrons free presentation ? No otherwise is it with episcopacy ; which thankfully professes to hold at once from God and the King ; its calling , of God , its place and exercise of jurisdiction , of the King : and , if it be objected , that both some former , and modern divines , both abroad ▪ and at home , borrowing s. Jeromes' phrase , have held the superiority of Bishops over presbyters , to be grounded rather upon the custom of the church , than any appointment of Christ , i must answer ; first , that we cannot prescribe to other men's thoughts ; when all is said , men will take liberty , ( And who can hinder it ? ) to abound in their own sense : but secondly , if they shall grant ( As they shall be forced ) that this custom was of the church apostolical , and had its rise , with the knowledge , approbation , practise of those inspired legates of Christ , and was from their very hands recommended to the then present , and subsequent church , for continuance ; there is no such great dissonance in the opinions , as May be worthy of a quarrel . 

The second , is intended to raise envy against us , as the uncharitable censurers , and condemners of those reform churches abroad , which differ from our government : wherein , we do justly complain of a sclanderous aspersion cast upon us ; we love and honour those sister-churches , as the dear spouse of Christ ; we bless God for them ; and we do heartily wish unto them that happiness in the partnership of our administration , which , i doubt not , but they do no less heartily wish unto themselves . 

Good words , you will perhaps say , but what is all this fair compliment , if our act condemn them , if our very tenet exclude them ? for , if episcopacy stand by divine right , what becomes of those churches that want it ? Malice and ignorance are met together in this unjust aggravation : first , our position is only affirmative ; implying the justifiableness , and holiness of an episcopal calling , without any further implication : next , when we speak of divine right , we mean not an express law of God , requiring it upon the absolute necessity of the being of a church ( What hindrances soever May interpose ) but a divine institution , warranting it where it is , and requiring it where it May be had ; every church therefore , which is capable of this form of government , both May , and aught to affect it , as that , which is , with so much authority derived from the apostles , to the whole body of the church upon earth ; but , those particular churches , to whom this power and faculty is denied , lose nothing of the true essence of a church , though they miss something of their glory and perfection , whereof they are barred , by the necessity of their condition ; neither are liable to any more imputation , in their credit , and esteem , than an honest , frugal , officious tenant , who , notwithstanding the proffer of all obsequious services , is tied to the limitations and terms of an hard landlord . But so much we have reason to know , of the judgement of the neighbour churches , and their famous divines , that , if they Might hope to live so long , as to see a full freedom of option tendered unto them , by sovereign authority , with all suitable conditions , they would most gladly embrace this our form of government ; which differs little from their own , save , in the perpetuity of their ( {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , or ) moderator-ship , and the exclusion of that lay-presbytery , which never , till this age , had footing in the Christian church . 

Neither would we desire to choose any other judges of our calling , and the glorious eminence of our church , so governed , than the famous professors of Geneva itself ; learned Lectius for a civilian , and for a divine , fredericus span•emius , the now renowned pastor , and reader of divinity in Geneva ; who in his dedicatory epistle before the third part of his dubia euangelica , to the incomparable Lord primate of Ireland , doth zealously applaud , and congratulate unto us , the happy , & ( As he conceiveth ) flourishing estate of our church , under this government , magnifying the graces of God in the Bishops thereof , and shuts up with fervent prayers to God for the continuance of the authority of the prelates of these churches . Oh then , while Geneva itself praiseth our government , and God for it , and prays for the happy perpetuation of it , let it not be suffered , that any ignorant or spiteful sectaries , should openly in their libels curse it , and maliciously brand it , with the terms of unlawful , and Antichristian : your wisdoms cannot but have found abundant reason to hate , and scorn this base and unreasonable suggestion ; which would necessarily infer , that not Christ , but Antichrist , hath had the full sway of all God's church upon earth , for these whole sixteen hundred years ; a blasphemy which any Christian heart must needs abhor ; and who that ever hath looked into either books , or men , knows not , that the religious Bishops of all times , are , and have been they , which have strongly held up the kingdom of Christ , and the sincere truth of the gospel , against all the wicked machinations of Satan , and his Antichrist ? And even amongst our own , how many of the reverend , and learned fathers of the church , now living , have spent their spirits , and worn out their lives in the powerful opposition of that man of sin . Consider than i beseech you , what a shameful injustice it is , in these bold sclanderers , to cast upon these zealously-religious prelates , famous for their works ( Against Rome ) in foreign parts , the guilt of that , which they have so meritoriously and convincingly opposed . If this most just defence May satisfy them , i shall for their sakes rejoice ; but , if they shall either with the wilfully-deaf adder stop their ears , or against the light of their own consciences , ( Out of private respects ) bear up a known error of uncharitableness , this very paper shall one day be an evidence against them , before the dreadful tribunal of the almighty . 

What should i urge in some others , the careful , peaceable , painful , conscionable managing of their charges , to the great glory of God , and comfort of his faithful persons ? And , if while these challenge a due respect from all well-minded Christians , some others hear ill , ( How deservedly , god knows , and will in due time manifest ) yet , why should an holy calling suffer ? why should the faults ( If such be ) of some , diffuse their blame to all ? Far , far we know is this , from the approved integrity of your noble justice , while in the mean time , ( Unless your just check do seasonably remedy it ) the impetuous and undistinguishing vulgar are ready so to involve all , as to make innocence itself a sin ; and ( Which i am amazed to think of ) dare say , and write , the better man , the worse Bishop . 

And now , since i am fallen upon this sad subject , give me leave i beseech you , to profess , with how bleeding an heart , i hear of the manifold scandals of some of the inferior clergy , presented to your view , from all parts ; it is the misery , and shame of this church , if they be so foul as they are suggested ; but , if i durst presume so far , i should , in the bowels of Christ , beseech you , ( Upon the finding of so hateful enormities ) to give me leave to put you in mind , of the charitable example of our religious Constantine , in the like case ; you cannot dislike so gracious a pattern ; i plead not for their impunity , let them ( Within the sphere of their offence ) bear their own sin ; but oh , forbid to have it told in Gath , or published in the streets of Ascalon ; your wisdoms well see , under what malignant eyes we are , of opposite spectators ; what a death it is , to think of the sport , and advantage these watchful enemies will be sure to make of our sins , and shame ? What exprobrations , what triumphs of theirs , will hence ensue ? These , and all other our cares are now securely cast upon your exquisite prudence , and goodness ; the very mention of our fears , while ye sit , had need to crave pardon of presumption ; but withal , to take down the insolence of those envious insulter's , it May please you to give me leave to tell them , that , however , in so numerous a multitude , there be found some foully vicious , ( As there is no pomegranate wherein some grains are not rotten , and even in twelve there is one Judas ) yet , upon a just survey , it will be found , that no one clergy in the whole Christian world , yields so many eminent scholars , learned preachers , grave , holy , and accomplished divines , as this church of England doth at this day ; and long , and ever May it thus flourish , as it surely shall ( Through God's blessing ) while the bountiful encouragements of learning , and ingenuous education are happily continue to it ; and the more , when those luxuriant boughs of disorder and debauchedness , are through just censures seasonably lopped off . 

But stay ; where are we , or what is this we speak of , or to whom ? While i mention the church of England , as thinking it your honour , and my own , to be the professed sons of such a mother , i am now taught a new divinity , and bidden to ask , which church we mean ? My simplicity never thought of any more churches of England but one ; now this very dayeswiser discovery tells us of more ; there is a prelatical church ( They say ) for one ; and , which is the other ? Surely it is so young , that as yet , it hath no name ; except we shall call it indefinitely , as the Jews were wont to style the creature they could not abide to mention , that other thing ; and what thing shall that be , think we ? Let it be called , if you please , the church antiprelatical ; but leave England out of the style ; let it take a larger denomination , and extend to our friends at Amsterdam , and elsewhere , and not be confined to our England : withal , let them be put in mind , that they must yet think of another subdivision of this division ; some there are ( They know ) which can be content to admit of an orderly subordination of several parishes to presbyteries , & those again to synods ; others are all for a parochial absoluteness , and independence ; yea , and of these , there will be a division , in semper divisibilia ; till they come to very atoms : for to which of those scores of separated congregations , known to be within and about these walls will they be joined ? and how long without a further scissure ? Oh God ; where do men stay , when they are once past the true bounds ? But if it be so , that the prelatical part must needs make up one dividend member of this English church ; tell me , brethren , i beseech you , what are the bounders of this church ? what the distinction of the professors and religion ? and , if the clients of the prelacy , and their adherents , ( Whose several thousands are punctually calculated ) be they who make up this prelatical church , what grounds of faith , what new creed do they hold , different from their neighbours ? what scriptures , what baptism , what eucharist , what Christ , what heaven , what means of salvation other than the rest ? Alas , my brethren , while we do fully agree in all these , and all other doctrinal and practical points of religion ; why will ye be so uncharitable , as by these frivolous and causeless divisions , to rend the seamless coat of Christ ? Is it a title , or a retinue , or a ceremony , a garment , or a colour , or an organ-pipe , that can make us a different church , while we preach and profess the same saving truth , while we desire ( As you profess to do ) to walk constionably with our God , according to that one rule of the royal law of our maker ; while we oppose one and the same common enemy , while we unfeignedly endeavour to hold the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace ? Oh consider , i beseech you in the fear of God , consider , whether these be the thoughts of the sons of peace , and such as are suitable to the charge , and legacy of our dear saviour , and think seriously from what spirit they proceed ; for us , we make no difference at all ( In the right and interest of the church ) betwixt clergy and laity , betwixt the clergy and laity of one part , and another ; we are all your true brethren ; we are one with you , both in heart and brain ; and hope to meet you in the same heaven ; but if ye will needs be otherwise minded , we can but bewail the church's misery , and your sin ; and shall beseech God to be merciful to your willing and uncharitable separation . Howsoever , i have freed my soul before my God , in the conscience of this just expostulation , and faithful advise . 

What remains , but that i pour out my heart in my fervent , and daily prayers to the father of all mercies , that it would please him to inspire this great counsel , with all wisdom from above ; and crown this great meeting with the blessing of all happy success , so as it May produce much glory to his own name , much complacency and contentment to his dear anointed , comfort to all good hearts , terror to his enemies , seasonable restraint to all insolence and faction , prevention of all innovations ; and lastly , a firm peace and settlement to this church and commonwealth , and to all other his majesty's dominions ? Which God grant for the sake of the son of his love , Jesus Christ the righteous . amen . Amen .
