TO THE READER . 

I Easily foresee some People will be disobliged with the Freedom of these Papers , and think themselves treated with too little Ceremony ; But unless they can disarm their pretended Adversary , and confute his Arguments , I would desire them by all means to smother their Resentments : For as bad as the World is , to appear in defence of Pride , and turn Advocate for the Devil , looks like an untoward sort of an Employment . However to sweeten their Humour as much as may be , they may please to consider that there was no good to be done in this Case without plain dealing ; This Malady of all others must be well examined , otherwise it 's in vain to expect a Cure. 't is to no purpose to declaim in general against a Proud man , and to give him a great many hard Names ; for unless you point directly upon his Vice , distinguish its Nature , and discover the weakness of that which he builds upon . Every one will be sure to avoid the Charge and parry against the Application . Farther , to abate their Censure I think it not improper to acquaint them that here are no particular Characters attempted , nor is there the least intention to provoke or expose any Person Living . Besides when a Piece like this is drawn from so many different Faces ; the mixing of Features and Complexions , will keep the Originals from being discovered . In short the Design of this small Discourse is only to make Men more useful and acceptable to Society , and more easy to themselves than they generally are : And that those who overtop their Neighbours upon any considerable account ; may manage their Advantage with that Modesty and good Humour , that none may have any just occasion to wish them lesle . 

A Moral Essay UPON PRIDE , IN A CONFERENCE Between PHILOTIMUS and PHILALETHES . 

Philot.   Philalethes , I am glad to see you , though you are so wrapped up in Speculation that I scarce knew you at first sight ; pray why so thoughtful ? you don't use to have so much Philosophy in your Face . 



Philal.   I have a particular reason to look a little pretendingly at present ; therefore I hope you will excuse it . 



Philot.   With all my heart , for I suppose you will not make a practice of it : But whatever Emergency you may be under , I would advice you to appear in your old shape again ; for in my Judgement that contemplative Figure does not become you . 



Philal.   I am sorry to hear Thinking agrees so ill with my Constitution ; but I hope this Alteration does not arise from any natural Antipathy I have to Sense , but from the unacceptableness of the subject I am upon . 



Philot.   Pray if it be not too free a Question , what were you musing upon ? 



Philal.   Why last night I happened to light upon an overgrown Fop , who plagued the Company with such an impertinent History of his Quality and Performances , and was so vain and insolent in all his behaviour , that as soon as I was delivered from him , I had a plentiful occasion to consider the unreasonableness of Pride ; which is the present Employment of my Thoughts , and upon a full view , I find so much folly , and ill humour , and Monster , in the Composition of this Vice , that I am ashamed , and almost afraid , of the Idea I have raised . 



Philot.   't is somewhat hard you can't stand the charge of your own Imagination ; But though I shall not dispute your Courage , yet I much question your Mortification . 



Philal.   The Reason of your censure ? 



Philot.   Because I have observed it 's but a bad Sign of Humility to declaim against Pride ; for he that is really humble will be unconcerned about Respect and Applause ; such a Person values himself upon nothing but his Conscience and Integrity , and therefore the haughtiness of another can't make him uneasy ; so that if he finds himself wince upon the account of neglect , he may be pretty well assured he has a fore place . 



Philal.   I think you are somewhat out in your notion of Humility ; for that virtue does not make us either servile or insensible , it does not oblige us to be ridden at the pleasure of every Coxcomb . We may show our dislike of an imperious humour , as well as of any other foolish Action , both for the Benefit of others , and in vindication of our own right . 



Philot.   I am glad to hear this concession from you , because from hence it follows that a man may have a just esteem of himself without being proud : Now if this observation was remembered and rightly applied , men would not be so censorious in this point , nor mistake their own Pride for their neighbours so often as they do . For instance , a man whom the Law has made my Superior , may take notice of his Quality if he pleases ; but this can't well be done , except he makes me an abatement of the regard he receives from me , therefore I ought not to interpret the Reserve or Familiarity of his Carriage as a Neglect , for provided he keeps within his proportion , he challenges nothing but his own ; so that if I am displeased , the Pride lies on my side , for affecting to have an equal Regard paid to persons who are unequal . 



Philal.   I have nothing to object against the main of your discourse , and conceive that the best way to know whether we are guilty or not , and to prevent charging this odious Imputation unjustly upon others , is to state the Nature of Pride , and to inquire into the Grounds of it . 



Philot.   I confess that is the way to pinch the Question , therefore let what will come of it , I will stand the Test of your Method , though I am afraid you will say some unacceptable things . 



Philal.   Suppose I do ; if the subject leads me to it , the fault is not mine : But to come to the point : Pride has a very strong Foundation in the mind ; it 's bottomed upon Self-love . 



Philot.   then I find there is somewhat to work upon . â€” 



Philal.   Pray give me leave , I say Pride is originally founded in Self-love , which is the most intimate and inseparable Passion of human Nature . The kindness men have for themselves , is apt to put them upon overvaluing their own things : which humour unless checked in time , will make them take most delight in those Circumstances and Actions which distinguish them from their Neighbours ; and place their supposed Advantages in the best light . Now this design is best pursued by being Master of uncommon Excellencies , which though desired by all , are possessed but by a few ; for the Rareness of things raises their Esteem , and draws a general Admiration . And their desire of being distinguished , is one reason why they love to keep the odds in their own hand , and to make the distance between themselves and their Neighbours as wide as may be , which often runs them upon a vain , and tyrannical Ostentation of their Power , Capacity , etc.  For this magnificent discovery makes the difference between them and their Neighbours the more apparent , and consequently occasions their own Greatness to be the more remarkable . 



Philot.   I think you have said something very remarkable , and I don't know but you may grow considerable by it , if you can prove your Assertion . 



Philal.   Pray what rising Doctrine have I laid down ? 



Philot.   You say that Pride is founded in Self-love , which is an unseparable Passion of human nature ; from whence I gather , that it 's impossible for a man not to be proud , because it 's impossible for a man not to love himself . We are like to have an admirable Preservative from you at this rate . 



Philal.   Not so fast , If you had attended to the whole , you might have observed that by self-love I meant the Excesses of it . 



Philot.   I thought a Man could not have loved himself too well . 



Philal.   If by loving you mean wishing himself happy , I agree with you ; for we may , or rather we must desire to be as happy as is possible , provided it be without prejudice to another . But then if Esteem is understood by Love , it 's easy ( without care ) to exceed in our own behalf ; and in this sense we certainly do love ourselves too well , as often as we set an overproportioned and unusual value upon any thing because it 's our own ; as if our fondness and partiality was the true Standard of worth , and we had the faculty of turning every thing we touched into gold . 



Philot.   I will not contest this point any farther with you ; but as I remember you started another Paradox , by intimating that it was a sign of Ambition to esteem any Excellency the higher for being uncommon : Now since the value of an Advantage is enhansed by its scarceness , and made more reputable to the owner ; I think it somewhat hard not to give a man leave to love that most which is most serviceable to him , 



Philal.   So it would if he had no body to love but himself ; but since he is both obliged and naturally inclinable to universal Benevolence , this altars the Case : for he who values any thing the more for being uncommon , will desire it should continue so , which is no kind Wish to his Neighbours , and is an Argument that a man does not delight in an Advantage so much for itself , as for the Comparison ; not so much for its own irrespective goodness , as because others want it . Now it affords a more generous , and I believe , a more transporting pleasure , to converse with universal Happiness , though we make no greater figure in it , than the rest of our Neighbours ; than to be gazed at , and admired by a Crowd of indigent and inferior People . 



Philot.   The World does not seem to be of your opinion ; however I will let your Argument pass for the good nature of it . But after all let me tell you , though I have no mind to be counted proud , yet I have a strong fancy for myself , and therefore if you will not allow me to be civil to my Person , we might even as good dispute no farther , for â€” 



Philal.   Don't trouble yourself , if your Terms are moderate , we 'll never break off upon the score , therefore I will offer at a short negative description of Pride , in which if it 's possible , I will give you Satisfaction . 



Philot.   Pray let us see how liberal you will be . 



Philal.   First it 's no part of Pride to be conscious of any perfections we have , whether intellectual or moral ; for this is in many Cases necessary , and impossible to be avoided . He that is wise or learned must know it , otherwise he can't understand when he judge's true or false , nor distinguish difficult and noble Speculations , from trifling and vulgar Remarks , nor tell when he acts rationally or not . Now a Man that is ignorant of these things can neither be wise nor knowing : Therefore as he that has a just and vigorous sense of the Magnitude , Distance and Colours of Objects , must conclude that he has eyes whether he will or not ; so these perfections of the mind discover themselves by their own Light. The Possessor can no more be ignorant of them , than he can doubt of his Existence when he is awake . To give one instance more ; How can any Person have true Fortitude , who does not know how far he ought to hazard himself , and wherein the baseness of Cowardice consists ? So that to affirm a Man may be ignorant of his own considerableness , is to make him wise and great , and good by Chance , which is a contradictition to the Excellencies supposed in him . 



Philot.   Right . And since I like the Frankness , and tendency of your Argument , I 'll try if I can reinforce it : I say then , supposing it was possible for a man to be ignorant of his good Qualities ; it was by no means convenient : For if he carried such a Treasure about him , without knowing how well furnished he was ; it 's somewhat hard to conceive , how he could either improve or use it . If it lay thus close , it would be little better , than a Mine undiscovered , for which neither the owner of the Ground , or any Body else are ever the richer , 



Philal.   You say well , and therefore I shall venture in the second place to affirm , That as we may be acquainted with our own Accomplishments , without being guilty of Pride , so neither is it any branch of this sin to discover that they are greater than some of our Neighbours enjoy . If we have a real Advantage over another , it 's no sin to be sensible of it ; to apprehend otherwise , is to judge contrary to the Reason of things , when the Case is plain , we may believe we have more Honesty , Sense , etc. than some others . This is as allowable as it is for us to think , that we have better Complexions than Moor , and are taller than Pigmies . 



Philot.   Can you go on ? 



Philal.   Yes , I 'm not afraid to add , Thirdly , that we don't fall into the sin of Pride , by being delighted with those Advantages of Mind , Body or Fortune , which Providence has given us ; these things in the very notion of them are supposed to be beneficial . Now it 's natural and necessary for us to be pleased with the Enjoyment of that which is good ; of that which is agreeable to our Faculties , and an Advancement of our Nature : To speak strictly , when the Faculty and the Object are rightly proportioned , Satisfaction follows of course , and it 's as impossible for us not to be pleased , as it is for fire not to ascend : Farther , if we are not allowed to take any Satisfaction in our condition , we are not bound to give God thanks for it , ; for we are not obliged to be thankful for that which does us no good : But nothing can do us any good , except it be by giving us a pleasure either in hand or in prospect . Fourthly , it is no part of Pride , to be more pleased with having an Advantage ourselves , than by seeing one of the same value possessed by another . 



Philot.   Make this out and you will oblige me . 



Philal.   Very well : I prove my Proposition thus . First , Because that which is in our Possession , or incorporated into our Essence , is always in our Power , and ready to be made use of when we think fit . But that which belongs to another is often at a distance , and out of our reach , and can't be communicated to us , though the owner was never so willing . Secondly , it must be more agreeable to be Master of any perfection ourselves , than to contemplate one of the same nature in another ; because every one is more certain of the kind Inclination he has to himself , than he can be of the Affection of any other Person whatever : That I will be always kind to myself , I am as well assured of , as that I have a being ; but that another will be so , is impossible for me to know : And therefore let a man be never so good natured , it must be somewhat more satisfactory to him , to see himself well furnished in any kind , than his Neighbour . Thirdly , that which is our own and in our Nature , we have the most intimate and vigorous sense of ; for the presence of any desirable Object , we know is more acceptable and entertaining than either the notion or Prospect of it : Possession gives us the Life of the thing , But hopes and Fancy can furnish out no more at the best than a Picture finely drawn . So that , for Example , let a man be of never so generous and disinterested a Spirit , yet it 's natural for him to be better pleased , with being rich himself ( if he has any value for riches ) than in having the bare Idea of an Estate : Besides as I observed , that which is our own , is always at our disposal , and does not depend upon the uncertain Inclination and humour of another . 



Philot.   Very comfortably argued . I find then by your discourse that a Man may without vanity be pleased with his Circumstances , and have good Thoughts of himself too , if he deserves it . Now some People are so unreasonable , that they will neither give Men leave to love , nor understand themselves ; if they are conscious of any commendable Quality , they must be sure to lay it out of the way that they may not see it ; nay if a Man has taken never so much care to make himself insignificant , in order to the promoting of Humility , they will scarce let him know he is good for nothing , for fear he should grow conceited of his Virtue . But I perceive you are not so straight laced , and pedantic in your Notions . Therefore if you can recover us no more Ground , let us know directly what Pride is , and be as fair as you can . 



Philal.   Why Pride in the plainest words which I can think of , is too high an Opinion of our own Excellency . 



Philot.   How shall we know when we overrate ourselves ? 



Philal.   That is a very seasonable question , and absolutely necessary to the state of the Case : Therefore I shall lay down some indisputable Marks of this Vice , that whenever we see the Tokens we may conclude the Plague is in the House . 



Philot.   Let us hear your Diagnosticks . 



Philal.   First , then we may be assured we have this Disease , when we value any Person chiefly because his advantages are of the same nature with those we enjoy , neglecting others who have an equal right to Regard , only because their Privileges are of a different kind from our own . For instance , when Men who derive their considerableness from the Sword , the Gown , or their Ancestors , think none worthy their Esteem but such as claim under their own Pretences ; In this case it 's evident it can be nothing but Partiality and Conceitedness which makes them give the Pre-eminence . 



Secondly , We may certainly conclude ourselves infected with this Vice , when we invade the Rights of our Neighbour , not upon the account of Covetousness , but of Dominion ; only that we may have it in our power to create Dependencies , and to give another that which is already his own . 

Thirdly , When Men don't measure their civil Advantages by the Laws of their Country , but by their own fancies , and the submissions of Flatterers ; this is another infallible sign they are Proud.  

Fourthly , to mention no more , When Men love to make themselves the subject of discourse : To con over their Pedigrees , and obtrude the Blazon of their exploits upon the company ; this is an argument they are overgrown with conceit , and very much smitten with themselves . 

Philot.   Though I think you have hit the symptoms pretty well , yet except they are marked somewhat more distinctly , 't is possible for a Man to have most of them without being ever the wiser . For unless we are able to draw up a just State of the Degrees of merit , we can never take the true height of our Pretensions , and being in this uncertainty its odds if self Love does not make us determine to the prejudice of our Neighbours . Now I would gladly know how we must go to work to be sufficiently informed in this Point . 



Philal.   We must endeavour to get right apprehensions of the several Excellencies of human Nature , and what proportion they hold to each other : In order to the assisting our Judgement in this case I shall lay down these general rules . 



First , Those advantages which spring from ourselves , which are the effects of our power and courage , of our Industry or Understanding , are more valuable than those which are derived , and borrowed , because they are a sign of a Richer and more active nature . 

Secondly , Those Qualities which are most useful aught to have the Preference : for since acknowledgements ought to be suitable to the nature of benefits received , those who have the largest Capacity of obliging , may fairly challenge the Perheminence in our Esteem ; and therefore in the third place the duration of an advantage ought to be considered ; And that which has the firmest Constitution and is most likely to continue , aught to be preferred to others which are brittle and short lived . These rules carefully applied will snew us how far our pretensions to Regard are short of , or exceed other men's , and so prevent an overweening opinion of ourselves . However , we are to observe that outward Respect ought to be given according to the Distinctions of ; Law , and though a Man may happen to be very defective in point of merit , yet we ought to take notice of the value Authority has set upon him . 

Philot.   Give me leave to put in a word , which is to tell you , that though I am not satisfied with your Instances , yet I am glad to find you will allow us different degrees of worth . I was almost afraid you would have set all Mankind upon a Level . 



Philal.   To deliver you from such apprehensions , I freely grant you that the Distinctions of Quality ought to be kept up for the Encouragement of Industry , and the support of Government . I hope now you have the reason of my Concession , you will not be so suspicious for the future . 



Philot.   no , not till you give me a farther occasion ; especially since the inference of your discourse is not unacceptable : from whence it followeth , that when a Man sees plainly that he has the Advantage of his Neighbour , he may let him understand so much without any offence to humility . 



Philal.   no doubt of it , especially when his station is public ; but then the discovery of his superiority ought to be managed with a great deal of Art and good nature , to which we are obliged not only in point of Complaisance but Justice . For though there is often a real difference between one Man and another , yet the party who has the advantgae usually magnifies the inequality beyond all Sense , and Proportion . Men don't consider that the great privileges of human Nature are common to the whole Kind ; such as being equally related to God and Adam , Reason and Immortality , the same number of Senses , and much of the same perfection and continuance . And as for those things which are the peculiar Advantages of a few ; they are either acquired and enjoyed by the strength of those general ones I have mentioned , or else they are foreign and in a great measure Chimerical , and therefore can be no real enrichments of our nature . They are often no more than the Blessings of Chance , of Flattery , and Imagination . And though they may set us upon higher Ground , yet they can add nothing to the true Stature of our Being . But to combat this Vice more successfully , we 'll examine its most plausible Pretences , and see if we can discover the weakness of them . 



Philot.   What pretences are those ? 



Philal.   I mean Learning , Nobility , and Power ; for these you know are accounted the brightest and most distinguishing Advantages . But though they ought all to be considered , yet I believe there is much more Weight laid upon them , than in strict reason they will bear . 



Philot.   You talk as if you were retained by the Mobile , and had a Mind to bring us back to our original State of Ignorance and Peasantry . 



Philal.   I tell you once again you are much mistaken . I have no design to lessen the value of any man's Honour , or Understanding : Let People have as much Sense and Quality as they please , provided they don 't grow troublesome and ridiculous about it . 



Philot.   I somewhat suspect you have a mind to engross this Vice of Pride to yourself . This sort of discourse looks like declaiming against Arbitrary Power , where the sharpest Invectives are commonly made by the most Enterprizing , and unmortifyed Men , who are only angry that they are not possessed of that absoluteness themselves , which they endeavour to render odious in others . 



Philal.   Ha ! you are somewhat smart . However let me tell you , if I have any such project as you imagine , you have me upon a fair Dilemma . For , if my reasons against Pride hold good , they will stand upon record against myself , which I suppose will be no unacceptable revenge for you : if they are insignificant , you will have the diversion of laughing at the folly of the attempt : and which is more considerable , you may keep your good opinion of yourself into the bargain . 



Philot.   Pray begin your attack as you think fit , and for disputes sake I 'll try how far I can maintain the ground against you . 



Philal.   First then , Learning ( to begin there ) and High Conceit agree very well together : for a Man of Letters may have a clearer notion of the stupidness and deformity of this Vice , and being better acquainted with the frame and passions of human Nature , he can't choose but discover how unacceptable it must make him to all Mankind . Besides he is supposed to know that nothing in strict reason deserves a true Commendation , but a right use of the Liberty of our Will , which is in every one's power to manage to advantage . 

Secondly , Learning gives us a fuller conviction of the imperfection of our nature , which one would think might dispose us to Modesty . The more a Man knows the more he discovers his ignorance . He can scarce look upon any part of the Creation , but he finds himself encompassed with doubts and difficulties . There is scarce any thing so trifling or seemingly common , but perplexes his Understanding , if he has but sense enough to look into all the objections which may be raised about it . He knows he has a being 't is true , and so does a Peasant , but what this thing is which he calls himself , is hard to say . He has reason to believe , that he is compounded of two very different Ingredients , Spirit , and Matter ; but how such unallyed and disproportioned substances should hold any Correspondence and act upon each other , no man's Learning yet could ever tell him . Nay how the parts of Matter cohere , is a Question which it 's likely will never be well answered in this life . For though we make use of the fairest Hypotheses , yet if we pursue the Argument home , we shall go nigh to dispute away our Bodies , and reason ourselves all in pieces . Insomuch that if we had nothing but Principles to encourage us , we might justly be afraid of going abroad , lest we should be blown away like a heap of dust : For it 's no solution to say the greater parts of Matter are connected with hooked particles ; for still the difficulty returns how these Hooks were made ? Quis custodiet ipsos Custodes ? What is it that fastens this Soder , and links these first Principles of Bodies into a Chain ? And as the more refined Understandings know little or nothing of themselves , and of the material World ; so upon Enquiry we shall find them as defective in their Skill about Moral Truths : ( excepting those who are taught by Revelation , which supernatural Discoveries the unlearned are capable of understanding , as far as their happiness is concerned . ) Those who made Laws in their respective Countries , we have reason to believe had their minds polished above the vulgar rate : And yet we see how unaccountably the public Constitutions of Nations vary . The Persians and Athenians allowed Incest , the LacedÃ¦monians Stealing , and some Indians Herodotus mentions , used to bury their best Friends in their Stomaches . In short , the Rules of Decency , of Government , of Justice itself , are so different in one place from what they are in another , so particoloured and contradictious , that one would almost think the Species of men altered , according to their Climates ; and that they had not the same Nature in common . One would almost think that Right and Wrong lay rather in the Fancies of men , than in the reason of things , and was bounded more by Seas and Rivers , than by any unalterable limits of Nature ; that Virtue and Vice were minted by the Civil Magistrate , and like Coins would pass for Currant only in his own Dominions . The Heathen Philosophers may fairly be granted to have as good pretences to Learning , as any other sort of men among them : And yet we may observe from Tully and Laertius what a small Proportion of solid Knowledge they were Masters of ; how strangely did they differ in Matters of the highest Import ? How eagerly did they dispute , and not without probability on both sides : Whether there was any thing certain ? Whether the Criteria of Truth and Falsehood were clear and indubitable or not ? Whether the Government of the World was casual , fatal , or providential ? How many Summum Bonums have they presented us with , some of them only fit to entertain a Brutus , others noble enough for a Spirit of the highest Order ? It were tedious to recount the differences one Sect had with another , their Inconsistences with themselves , and the ridiculous and ill supported Tenets some of the most famous of them have held . Insomuch that Tully takes notice that there was no opinion so absurd , but was held by some Philosopher or other . 't is true they could wrangle and Harangue better than the common People ; they could talk more plausibly about that they did not understand ; but their Learning lay chiefly in Flourish , and Terms , and Cant ; for as for any real Improvements in Science they were not much wiser than the lesle pretending Multitude . Indeed the more modest of them would confess that the chief use of Learning was to give us a fuller discovery of our Ignorance , and to keep us from being peremptory and dogmatical in our determinations . Now one would imagine the more intimate Acquaintance we had with the Imperfections of our Nature , the greater reason we should have to be humble . Is Weakness a proper Foundation to erect our lofty conceits upon ? Indeed he that has not the leisure or capacity to examine how it 's with him , may be fond persuaded to fancy himself somebody , and grow vain upon the kind presumption ; but for a man to be proud who can demonstrate his own poverty , is little lesle than Madness . 



Philot.   If the case stands thus , to make all sure , we had best get an order to burn the Twenty four Letters , and hang up CadmÃ¼s in Effigy ; for â€” 



Philal.   Pray don't interrupt me , and I will try if I can give you a little Ease . Granting therefore , as we may , that Learning does give some advantage , and that our Understandings are really enriched by it ; yet in regard we have but a few Principles to build upon , the greatest part of our Knowledge must consist in Inferences , which can't be wrought out without great Labour and Attention of mind : And when we are at any distance from self-evident Truths , the mind is not only perplexed with the Consideration of a great many Circumstances , but which is worse , Forgetfulness or Mistake in the least of them , frustrates our whole Design , and rewards us with nothing but Error for our trouble . 

Now he that is so liable to be imposed upon , who rises but by Inches , and enriches himself , by such slow and insensible Degrees ; 't is a Sign that his Stock was either very small , or that he is unskilful in the management of his Business , and therefore he has no reason to be proud of what he has gotten : Besides it 's an humbling consideration to reflect what pains we are obliged to take to muster up our Forces , and to make that little reason we have serviceable . How fast does Obscurity , Flatness and Impertinency flow in upon our Meditations ? 't is a difficult Task to talk to the purpose , and to put life and perspicuity into our Discourses ; those who are most ready and inventive have not their best Thoughts uppermost : no , they must think upon the Stretches , ransack , and turn over their mind , and put their Imagination into a kind of Ferment , if they intent to produce any thing extraordinary : So that considering the Trouble and almost Violence we are put upon , one would think that Sense and Reason was not made for Mankind , and that we strive against our Natures , when we pretend to it . 



Philot.   Well ; What though our Minds were poor , and unfurnished at first , is it any disparagement to us to have more Wit than we were born with ? What though we can't strike out a Science at a Heat , but are forced to polish ourselves by degrees , and to work hard for what we have ? The lesle we were assisted by Nature , the greater commendation it is to our Industry , and our attainments are so much the more our own . And since we have thus fairly distinguished ourselves by Merit , why should we seem unapprehensive of our Performances ? since we have paid so dear for the Improvements of our understanding , and our advantages are gained with so much Difficulty , what harm is it to make our best of them ? Why should we not oblige the negligent to Distance and Regard , and make those who are younger or lesle knowing than ourselves sensible of their Inferiority ? 



Philal.   I agree with you as I have already hinted , that a Man may lawfully maintain his Character and just pretences against Rudeness and Ignorance , especially when the public Good is concerned in his Reputation . But when he acts a private part , and converses with People of Sense and Modesty , he should give them but very gentle remembrances of his Prerogative : his Opinion of his own worth should but just dawn upon them , and at the most give them but an obscure and remote notice , that he expected any singular Acknowledgement : He should take the respect that is paid him rather as a Present than a Debt , and seem thankful for that which is his own : But to be stiff and formally reserved as if the Company did not deserve our Familiarity ; to be haughty and contemptuous , and to make scanty and underproportioned returns of Civility : this is a downright Challenge of Homage , and plainly tells people , they must be very mannerly : 't is in effect to say , Gentlemen , I have more Learning , and have done the public greater Service than you , and therefore I expect to be considered for it : you may possibly say that I have more preferment too , and am paid for my merit in money , but that shall not serve your turn ; for except you show yourselves very dutiful , I shall give you broad Signs of my dissatisfaction , and never let you have the Honour of my converse again . Now such a Man if he went much abroad , would plague mankind more with his Company , than he could oblige them with his writings , though they were never so considerable . Such People seem to own their parts to their ill Temper : Their Industry is malicious , and they have taken pains not so much to oblige the World , as to get an Opportunity of trampling upon their Inferiors . Had they been good-natured , they would have been as dull and insignificant as their Neighbours . But their imperious Carriage is just as reasonable as it would have been for the old Athletae to have drudged hard in Eating and Exercise , that they might employ their Bulk and Activity in beating every one who was weaker , and lesle skilful than themselves . 



Philot.   By your discourse you seem to mistake the matter , and not to weigh things rightly . 't is not Superiority that these Gentlemen of Learning are so solicitous about ; 't is not personal Advantage which they chiefly intent by their Reservedness : They have no doubt a more public and generous Design ; for you may observe they usually bear hardest upon those of their own Order and Profession , which is nothing but a forced and politic stateliness for the promoting of Knowledge in others . The young Fry , whether you know it or not , must be held at a Distance , and kept under the Discipline of Contempt . If you give them any tolerable Quarter , you indulge them in their Idleness , and ruin them to all intents and purposes . For who would be at the trouble of Learning , when he finds his Ignorance is caressed , and that he is easy and acceptable enough in the Company of the best Authors of the Town ? But when you browbeat them and maul them , you make them Men for ever ; for Vexatio dat intellectum ; though they have no natural Metal , yet if they are spurred and kicked they will mend their pace , if they have any feeling . Such rigorous usage will make them study night and day to get out of this ignominious Condition , in hopes that it may come to their own turn to be proud one day . Take my word for it , there is no such way to make a Scholar , as to keep him under while he is young , or unpreferred . 



Philal.   Notwithstanding your Flourish I can't persuade myself that this Dispensation of Pride is so mighty useful as you pretend . I should think such an untoward management of any Accomplishment should rather discourage others from attempting such dangerous circumstances . If Sense and Learning are such unsociable imperious things , a good-natured Man ought to take especial care not to improve too fast . He ought to keep down the growth of his Reason , and kerb his Intellectuals when he finds them ready to outstrip his Neighbours . I assure you , if I was of your opinion , and thought myself near the temptation to so much ill humour , I would never look on a Book again . 



Philot.   Come when you have said all , there is no keeping up the Credit of Learning without that which you call a reserved behaviour . For if those who are eminent this way should condescend to those Familiarities which you seem to desire , the honour of their Profession would suffer much by it ; if they should converse upon the Level , the veneration which their Inferiors have for them would quickly wear off : And if the vulgar observed there was no distinction kept up amongst the Men of Letters ; they would suspect there was nothing extraordinary in any of them . Pray who are supposed to be the best Judges of Learning , those who have it or others ? 



Philal.   no doubt those who have it . 



Philot.   then if they seem to undervalue it themselves , is not this the way to bring it into a general disrepute ? I tell you once again , if the privileges of Merit are not insisted upon all , must go to wrack . If a Man who has digested all the Fathers , and is ready to add himself to the Number , shows any tolerable countenance to one who has scarce rubbed through Ignatius , and let's a pure English Divine to go cheek by jowl with him , the Commonwealth of Learning will grow almost as contemptible as that of the Pigmies , and be only fit to write Romances upon . 



Philal.   I shall not inquire how far this lofty method may advance the Reputation of Learning , but I am pretty sure it 's no great addition to theirs who use it ; for it only makes others more inquisitive into their defects , and more inclinable to expose them . If they take them tardy they endeavour to humble them by way of Reprisal . Those slips and mismanagements are usually ridiculed and aggravated , when such persons are guilty of them , which would be overlooked or excused in others of a more modest and affable Conversation . If they hap to be found inconsistent with themselves : If their vanity of appearing singular puts them upon advancing Paradoxes , and proving them as Paradoxically . If a presumption upon their own strength , and a desire of greater triumph makes them venture too far into the enemy's Quarters , and take up a Post which they can't maintain ; they are usually laughed at for their folly and left to shifted for themselves ; for Pride never has any friends , and all Men are glad of a just occasion to lessen his Reputation who makes such an illnatured use of it . 



Philot.   I conceive you harp a little too much upon one string : do you think the inferior Clergy for whom you are now pleading , are discouraged by none but those of their own Profession ? 



Philal.   no , I grant there is another sort of People who use them with neglect enough : But then they are somewhat more to be excused . They have not such fair opportunities to understand the just pretences of a liberal Education , and a Religious employment . They are apt to fall under unfortunate hands in their minority : The vanity of their Parents , and the Knavery of Flatterers often gives them a wrong notion of themselves , and makes them admire nothing but Wealth hand Greatness , and think no condition deserves regard but that which resembles their own . Besides their neglect looks lesle unaccountably by reason of their Quality , and their Breeding makes their Pride sit more decently upon them . They usually contemn with a better Grace than others : for there is a great deal of Art and Mystery in Pride to manage it handsomely : A man might almost as soon learn a Trade : and if we observe we shall find that those who were not brought up to it , seldom prove their Craftsmaster or practice with any sort of address . To which I may add , that such persons are usually willing to pay for their imperiousness , so that a Man is not made a Fool for nothing . But when this lofty humour is clumsily and inartificially managed , when it 's affected by those of a selfdenying and mortified Profession , and who get their Living by declaiming against it . When it 's taken up by Men of Sense , who may well be expected to see through the folly of this Vice , and who generally have not those pretences of a biased Education to misguide them : especially when they play it upon persons of their own Order who were born and bred to as fair Expectations of Regard as themselves , and are sometimes their Inferiors in nothing so much as in Success ; this is such a singular Practice that I had rather leave it undescribed than be forced to give it its proper Character . 



Philot.   I believe you will be willing to abate , if not to retract your censure when you consider that these Gentlemen of the Gown , whom you think too much depressed , are many of them Curates ; and is it not very reasonable there should be a distance observed between Masters and Servants ? If you confound these two Relations by lavish and indiscreet Familiarities , you destroy the respect , and by degrees the very notion of Superiority . If there is not a due Homage paid in Conversation , those who are in a state of subjection will neither know their Condition nor their Duty : They will be apt to forget they hold by a servile Tenure , and think themselves enfranchised from all manner of Suit and Service . Besides , if the Parson should use his Curate with that freedom which you insinuate , as if there was neither dependence nor obligation between them ; this might be of very ill example to the Parish , and make all other servants challenge the same liberty , and grow pert upon their Masters : And when this Sauciness became universal , as it 's likely it might do in a short time , what lesle Mischief could be expected from it , than an old Scythian Rebellion ? 



Philal.   I confess , I was not aware the being of Government depended so much upon the distinction between Rector and Curate , and that if the modern way of Distance and Subordination was not kept up , we must presently return to Hob's state of Nature . If a Curate be such a dangerous thing , that a little civil Usage to him is ready to make the World fall about our Ears , I wonder why so many of them are suffered . Now without raising the posse Comitatus , if the Pluralists would but do their best to suppress them , their Number might quickly be so retrenched , that they would not be in the least formidable . But you seem to argue all this while upon a wrong Principle , you take it for granted , that Curates are Servants ; now if this proves a mistake , you will own they may be treated with a little more freedom , without any danger to Authority . 



Philot.   Who doubts of their being Servants ? 



Philal.   I do , and for very good reasons . 



Philot.   See how a Man may be mistaken ! I thought the English of Curate had been an Ecclesiastical Hireling . 



Philal.   no such matter , the proper import of the Word signifies one who has the Cure of Souls ; therefore in France all Parochial Priests are called Curates , as they are likewise in our Rubric and Common-prayer . 



Philot.   I find then there lies no Servitude in the Name , so that it must be either the Deputation , or Salary which they receive from the Instituted Priest , which sinks them into this condition . 



Philal.   That there is no Servitude in either of these , I am ready to make good . 1.  Not in the Office ; and here I must crave leave to ask you a few Questions . 



Philot.   Take your own method . 



Philal.   What in your apprehension is a Curate's Employment ? 



Philot.   To serve God in the public Offices of Religion , and to take care of the Parish . 



Philal.   then he is not entertained to serve the Rector . 



Philot.   Go on . 



Philal.   In the next place I desire to know whether Authority is not essential to a Master ? 



Philot.   Who questions it ? 



Philal.   Has the Curate his Authority to Preach , and Administer the Sacraments from the Rector ? 



Philot.   no , from the Bishop . 



Philal.   May not a Master turn away his Servants when he pleases ? 



Philot.   I think so . 



Philal.   But the Rector has no power to remove the Curate after he is Licenced and Fixed by the Bishop . To sum up the Evidence therefore ; if the Curate was not entertained to wait upon the Rector , nor has his Authority from him , nor can be removed from his Employment , I think it is pretty plain he is none of his Servant . 



Philot.   Well , but does not the Parson make choice of him , and pay him ? 



Philal.   Don't a Corporation choose a Mayor ? 



Philot.   What then ? 



Philal.   Pray who 's Servant is he after his Election ? 



Philot.   None but the Kings that I know of : but you have not answered the latter part of my objection about his being paid by the Rector . 



Philal.   If you had not called for my answer , I had waved it for your sake , because I think your objection borders somewhat upon Treason . 



Philot.   How so ? 



Philal.   Why , is it not of kin to Treason to say the Subjects are Masters over the Supreme Authority ? 



Philot.   If Nonsense will not excuse a Man , I think it is . 



Philal.   But your Argument proves the King a Servant to the People . 



Philot.   How ? 



Philal.   Because they pay him Taxes , and that among other reasons , by way of acknowledgement of the benefits of his Government , and that they may show themselves willing , if it was in their power , to requite him for his care of the State.  



Philot.   Pray why so much concerned to prove Curates no Servants ? 



Philal.   Because I am willing to rescue them from that contempt , which they will certainly fall into , as long as they pass under this notion : which considering the number of persons Officiating , this way , must be very prejudicial to Religion . Besides it makes some persons , who are fit to do the Church service , suspend themselves , and show their Priesthood only by their Habit , rather than serve God under such uncreditable circumstances : and for the same reason others are tempted to grow too fond of a Presentation , and choose rather to court it by Flattery , or other indirect practices , than be condemned to the servile condition of a Curate . For let me tell you , it is no ordinary piece of Selfdenial , for a Man of a generous Education , who has been trained up all along to Freedom and good Usage , to be degraded in his Manhood , when the mind is most in love with Liberty , and to enter upon Business with marks of disadvantage , when he stands most in need of Reputation . To my thinking this is a very discouraging and preposterous way of Educating the Clergy . If a Man must go to service , he had better begin with it as they do in Trades , and not be Master at first , and then be forced to turn Apprentice , or Journyman afterwards . Of such ill consequence it is to miscall things , and as Plato observes , that an alteration of the Notes in Music is apt to produce an Innovation in the Laws and Customs of a Country : so by changing the names of Offices for others of lesle Repute , we change the Uses and Designs of them , and make them lesle satisfactory to those engaged , and lesle serviceable to the Public than they would have been , if the Character of their Institution had been kept up . 



Philot.   Granting at present what you say to be true , yet a Curate seems to lie under another disadvantage , which makes him considered with Abatement . 



Philal.   What is that ? 



Philot.   Why , People are apt to fancy that it is the want either of Parts or Conduct , which keeps him without a Patron . 



Philal.   If People think so , I am sorry their Sense and Charity is no greater ; for if they examined things fairly , they would find that the being a Curate is no Argument of a Man's insignificancy , nor any just blemish to his Reputation . For it is often the integrity and generous temper of his mind which hinders him from a better Provision ; it is because he will not flatter the Pride of some , nor keep pace with the Bigotry of others : because he will neither court Greatness nor Faction , nor make himself popular to the disadvantage of his Audience . Because he cannot digest a Simoniacal Contract , nor charge through Perjury with the courage of an Evidence . In short , it is his plain and impartial dealing with the People , his resolution to preserve the Decency of his Character , and the Innocence of his Conscience which bars his promotion : so that if he was mean enough to complain , he might have the satisfaction to apply this Sentence of Tully to himself , Non nos vitia sed virtutes afflixerunt . 



Philot.   What a broad Innuendo is here upon the beneficed Clergy ? 



Philal.   I am glad you have given me an opportunity of explaining myself . My meaning is not that those who are possessed of livings have gained them , by such indirect Courses : God forbid ! I only say , that all Men are not so lucky as to have the offer of fair Conditions , and those who have not , must be Curates if they will be honest ; or else lay by the use of their Priesthood , which I am afraid is not very accountable . 



Philot.   I confess you have brought yourself off well enough : But now I think on 't you must try to maintain the liberty of your Curate a little more convincingly . For some say there lies Prescription and immemorial Custom against it , and then you know he is a Servant by Common Law.  



Philal.   Not at all : For as we are lately told by a great Lawyer , Prescription is good for nothing where there are any Records to the contrary . 



Philot.   What Records can you produce ? 



Philal.   Why , to mention no more , the 18th of the Apostles Canons , and the 80th of the Council of Eliberis , are , I think , considerable Evidence ; the first of which forbids the ordaining of those who had married a Servant , and the other excludes manumized persons , while their Patrons were living , from the Priesthood . 



Philot.   Say you so ? then I fancy those who drew up Queen Elizabeth's Injunctions knew nothing of this piece of Antiquity you mention . 



Philal.   Your Reason ? 



Philot.   Because by those Injunctions a Clergyman could not lawfully marry till he had gone and made his complaint against Celibacy , before two Justices of the Peace , and gained their consent , and the good will of the Master , or Mistress where the Damsel served . 



Philal.   And then I suppose if he could not prevail by his Rhetoric they gave him a Warrant to distrein . 



Philot.   Or possibly if he courted in forma pauperis they assigned him a Wife gratis out of an Hospital . 



Philal.   Upon my word this Order , take it which way you will , has a singular aspect , and looks as if it intended to put the Clergy in mind , that they ought not to aspire above an Abigail . Certainly Discretion and Merit ran very low in the Church at that time , or else , some People were willing to make the Nation believe so . But to return to the Canons , the design of which was to secure the Reputation of the Clergy ; but according to the modern opinion , this provision signifies nothing ; for if a man must go to Service after he is in Orders , had he not as good do it before ? In your sense he often only changes his Lay for an Ecclesiastical Master , which sometimes might be so far from an advantage that it would make the Servitude the more uneasy , by being subjected to one no more than equal to himself . 



Philot.   I grant you in the Primitive Times the advantage of Priesthood was equally shared among all the Order , and none of that Character had any Superiority over another . For then the Revenues of the Church consisted only in the voluntary Offerings of the People , which were all deposited with the Bishop , who assigned every one his respective portion ; so that no Priest had any dependence upon another for his maintenance ; but now the case is otherwise , and a man ought to be subject to him that supports him . 



Philal.   it 's somewhat hard , that the bare alteration of the Church Revenues should make so wide a difference between those who were equal before ; that a man must lose his freedom only for want of a Presentation , and he made a Servant because he does not take Tithes , though he has as much spiritual Authority as if he did . But I perceive you think there is no consideration equivalent to a little money , and that he who receives it must be no longer at his own disposal , though he makes never so valuable a return . Since therefore you insist so much upon maintenance , what if it appears that the Curate maintains the Parson ? 



Philot.   That would be strange indeed . 



Philal.   To what end were the Church Revenues intended ? 



Philot.   To keep up the worship of God.  



Philal.   Which way ? 



Philot.   By settling a competent maintenance upon the Ministers of Religion , that they may be in the better capacity to discharge their Office , and not be obliged to lose their time , and lessen their Character , by engaging in Laborious or Mechanical Employments . 



Philal.   By your arguing there should be something for them to do . 



Philot.   Yes , they are to take care of that Precinct to which their Endowment is annexed . 



Philal.   I hope you don't mean not to come at it . 



Philot.   I mean they are to take care of the performance of the duties of their Office.  



Philal.   then ought not he to have the Revenues who performs these Duties ? 



Philot.   I am not willing to grant that . 



Philal.   Have a care of denying the conclusion ; you grant the Revenues of the Church were designed for the support of the Clergy . 



Philot.   Yes . 



Philal.   Of what Clergy ? Those who live many miles distant from the Premises ? 



Philot.   no , I 'm afraid they were intended for those who live upon the place , otherwise methinks Endowments are a very slender Provision for the benefit of the Parish . 



Philal.   then if the Curate does all the work , ought he not to have the reward for his pains ? In short , either he is qualified to undertake the Parish or not ; if not , with what sincerity can he be employed ? If he is qualified , why is he barred the profit when he only performs the Conditions upon which they were settled , when none but himself answers the design they were intended for ? To speak properly , the Rector seems to live out of the labours of another , he is maintained by the perquisites of the Curates Office ; and therefore is in effect but a kind of Pensioner to him . 



Philot.   I see you are an everlasting Leveller , you won't allow any encouragement to extraordinary Industry and Merit . 



Philal.   You mistake me . I would have the best men have the best livings , but then before we go to doubling of Preferments , possibly it were not amiss to examine whether the number of Benefices exceeds the persons who are capable of them . Let us first examine whether they will hold out one apiece , and when every man has one , than the supernumerary livings may be divided amongst those who are most deserving . 



Philot.   In good time , when it 's likely there there will be none left ! Now do you imagine the Church can be defended against her Adversaries by the strength of a single Parsonage ? But it may be you will say all our Plurality-men are not Writers . 



Philal.   no , nor Readers neither . Besides , we may observe that Heresy and Schism were very successfully combated before Unions , Dispensations , and Consolidations were heard of . If you consult Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent , ( p. 216. ) he will inform you that Nonresidence and Pluralities are things of no very primitive establishment . I confess some of the Lay-managers of our Reformation have not been over-kind to the Church , so that Affairs are not in so good a posture as they might have been : But God be thanked there is still some provision left for the Ornament and Defence of Religion . 



Philot.   What Provision do you mean ? 



Philal.   Why , to speak to your Case , there are Dignities , to which those Gentlemen who are prepared to engage in the Controversy have a good right : And with submission to better Judgements , I think it would not be amiss if all dignified persons held their Preferments by a new Tenure . 



Philot.   What Tenure ? 



Philal.   By Knight's Service ; pursuant to which they should be obliged to draw their Pens in the Cause , when ever their Superiors required them : to appear in the Field upon an Invasion with their Quota , and in short , to maintain any Post that shall be assigned . 



Philot.   What if a man has not a mind to quarrel , must he be turned out of his Dignity for being of a peaceable Disposition ? 



Philal.   Those peaceable men you speak of , are none of the most useful in a time of War , and therefore a smaller Gratification should content them . 



Philot.   What if they are disabled by age ? 



Philal.   then they should be continued for their past Services . 



Philot.   Truly this is a good probable Expedient to keep the Church Militia in Discipline , and might for aught I know , very much improve the noble Science of Controversy . But to return to the old Argument , if you intent to bring me over to your opinion of the Curate , you must clear the business of his Salary a little better , for I am afraid where he has his money he ought to own he has his Master too . 



Philal.   I confess there would be a great deal in what you say , if the Rector had the right of Coinage . If the Money had his Image , and Superscription upon it , the Curate's taking it for currant , would conclude him under his Jurisdiction : but that the bare receiving a sum should sink a Man into a servile state , is past my comprehension . For considering that Money is a thing of such quality , and sovereign sway in the World , one would imagine it should bring Power and Reputation along with it , and rather enlarge than abridge a Man's Liberty by receiving it . And to mention nothing farther , the nature of the Contract between the Rector and Curate , is sufficient to give you satisfaction ; for there , as has been observed , the Curate undertakes no other Employment but the Instruction and Government of the Parish . There is no attendance upon the Parson , no running upon his Errands , nor subjection to his Humour indented for . 



Philot.   Methinks it is a little hard a Curate must not be called a Servant , as well as a Cook , or a Footman , since he has Wages as much as the other . 



Philal.   Possibly not always so much neither ; but waving that , if you had remembered what I urged to you before , this Objection would have been no difficulty . 



Philot.   What was that ? 



Philal.   Why , that the Curate is to wait upon none but God Almighty , that the manage of his Employment is not prescribed by the Rector , but by the Rubric and Constitutions of the Church , and that he is not removable at pleasure . I suppose by this time you apprehend there is a difference between him and a Footman , or a Steward either . 



Philot.   Well! Notwithstanding your subtlety , this notion of Wages sticks in my Stomach still . 



Philal.   I wonder the glitter of a little Money should dazzle your Eyes at that rate , that you cannot see so plain a distinction . You don't seem to understand Commerce , if you think that something of Authority and Dominion is always given in exchange for Mony. Now I am of Diogenes his mind , and believe it possible for one to buy a Master , as well as a Servant . 



Philot.   As how ? 



Philal.   Why , for the purpose , if a person of twenty one puts himself Apprentice to another , you know this is seldom done without charge : now what does a Man do in this case but purchase his subjection , and hire himself a drubbing upon occasion ? To give one instance more . When a Woman of Fortune marries a Man with nothing , does she not give him Meat , Drink , and Wages to govern her ? And to end this dispute , you know Physicians , and Lawyers , and Judges , have Fees or Wages , either given , or assigned them by Law , without being thought Servants to those they are concerned with . Now , what reason is there a Curate should have worse luck with his Money than other People ? 



Philot.   To deal plainly , I suppose it is because he does not get enough of it . If his Fees were as considerable as any of those Gentlemen you speak of , I question not but his Office would be much more reputable . 



Philal.   Well guessed , and therefore what Character do they deserve who confine him to this scandalous Pittance . I believe you can scarcely name any sort of Injustice which has a more malignant influence upon Religion than this oppresion of Curates . 



Philot.   Why so Tragical ? 



Philal.   Because their Poverty exposes them to Contempt , which renders their Instructions insignificant , and which is worse , makes them lesle considerable in themselves , as well as in the opinion of others . 



Philot.   I hope Poverty is no crime . 



Philal.   no , but it 's a scurvy temptation , especially to those who have lived freely , and been bred to better Expectations . For when a man finds his hopes disappointed , himself unsupported , and topped upon by persons of meaner Pretences and Employments ; this is apt to palls his Spirits , and check the courage of his thoughts , so that his Compositions and Fortune will seem to be much of a piece . 



Philot.   I thought straight circumstances had been none of the worst promoters of Learning , according to the old saying , Ingenii largitor Venture . 



Philal.   I grant there is some truth in your observation , and that it is Want which often reconciles men to Labour and Letters ; but this is at their first setting out , when though they have not gained their point , yet they are full of hopes , which pricks them on , and puts them upon their utmost . but after they are once qualified for success , and find their industry discouraged , this makes them sink in the socket , and fret away their strength and Spirits ; so that either out of impotence , or disgust , or despair , they give over the fruitless pursuit , and seldom make any generous attempt ever after . 't is true , there are some hardy souls that won't be beaten off by ill usage , but these are very rarely to be met with . 



Philot.   then you think there would be a strange improvement in the unbeneficed Clergy , if they had a better Salary . 



Philal.   Yes ; I think they would have more Books , and more Learning , and more Credit . They would not be so easily obliged to improper Compliances , nor so liable to several other miscarriages in their Conduct . 



Philot.   By your discourse the slender provision which is made for them , should be very Criminal . 



Philal.   Doubtless so it is . For pray consider . 



Philot.   Pray be as brief as you can . 



Philal.   I say then , for a Clergyman to enrich himself by the labour and necessities of one of his own Order , and make his Figure out of the Church without performing the Services required , is a direct translating the holy Revenues to a Foreign and secular use , and consequently besides other aggravations is no better than sacrilege , which is a very uncanonical Sin , and unless we are very much in the dark will be accounted for afterwards . In short this Practice has been the main ground of the Contempt of the Clergy , making one part of them grow cheap by their Poverty , and the other by their Covetousness . 



Philot.   Pray what allowance would you oblige the Rector to , if you had the Regulation of that Affair ? 



Philal.   To speak within Compass , in my Opinion the Curate ought to have half the profits , let the value of them be never so considerable ; for if the Parson has the other moiety for doing nothing , I think he has no reason to complain . But if the Living be small , than he that supplies it should have two thirds assigned him , because he cannot be decently supported under that proportion . 



Philot.   Well , I am not disposed to examine that matter any farther . But I beseech you what is all this to the business of Pride ? I think your Zeal for the Curates has transported you a little out of your Subject . 



Philal.   no such matter ; for it is generally nothing but Ambition which makes Men Covetous and Mean : besides , if it is a Digression it is a very seasonable one . However I am willing to take my leave of this part of the Argument , therefore if you please we will call a new Cause . 



Philot.   I think it is best to adjourn at present , and when we meet again I will venture the other Brush with you . 



Philal.   Till than Farewell . 



A SECOND CONFERENCE BETWEEN Philotimus and Philalethes . 

Philal.   WELL met ! I am glad the opportunity you mentioned is so quickly returned . 



Philot.   So am I , and therefore if you please without any further Ceremony , let us pursue the Argument we were last upon . 



Philal.   With all my Heart , and since ( as has been showed ) Learning and Conceit , make so odd a Figure ; let us proceed to examine the pretences of Nobility , for I am afraid the Vulgar Notion of it is screwed somewhat too high , and that it has not , Ballast enough to carry all the Sail which is commonly made out . 



Philot.   I must tell you , you are upon a touchy Point , and therefore I hope you will treat so nice a subject as this is with proportionable caution . 



Philal.   I am sensible of what you say , and shall manage my enquiry with all the fairness , and decency , the free discussion of the Question will allow . To begin , you know all Men were equally Noble , or if you will , equally Plebeian at first : now I would gladly understand how they came to be so much distinguished afterwards , for there are different reasons assigned . 



Philot.   I suppose the distinctions you mention , were founded upon extraordinary performances , and wone at the expense of Industry and Merit . For how can you imagine any persons should emerge out of the common Mass of Mankind , unless by the advantages of Capacity , Labour , and Resolution ? Their mounting , argues that Fire was the ruling Element in their Composition ; and that they were of a more vigorous and enterprizing Spirit than their Neighbours . 



Philal.   I am willing to suppose with you , that they made a generous use of these advantages , and employed them for the benefit of Mankind : being as remarkable for their Justice , Fidelity , and good Humour , as for their Conduct and Courage ; and therefore I am not willing to believe the account which some pretend to give concerning the Original of Nobility . 



Philot.   What is that ? 



Philal.   They will tell you that it has been often founded upon Rapine and Injustice . It seems they have observed out of Thucydides , that in ancient times it was counted an Heroic Atcheivement to Plunder lustily , and he was a Man of the best Quality , who was able to steal most dattle . These Nimrods' ( say they ) grew great by the strength of their Limbs and their Vices , engraved their Murders upon their Shields , and Hectored all the little and peaceable People into Peasantry . 



Philot.   This looks so like a Chimerical and ill natured Opinion , that I shall not do it the honour of a Confutation . 



Philal.   I have no exceptions to your Resentment , but to go on , for the more distinct consideration of the Argument , we will divide Nobility into two kinds , Hereditary , or Acquired . The first is transmitted to us from our Ancestors , the other is immediately conferred by the favour of the Prince . 



Philot.   Proceed upon the several parts of your Division . 



Philal.   1.  then , Hereditary Nobility seems no just ground for a high Opinion , because it is borrowed . Those great Actions which we had no share in , cannot properly be any part of our Commendation , especially if we want abilities to imitate them . 't is true , they ought to be taken notice of by others for the encouragement of Virtue , and the ornament of Society . But then he that depends wholly upon the worth of others , ought to consider that he has but the honour of an Image , and is worshipped not for his own sake , but upon the account of what he represents . To be plain , it is a sign a Man is very poor when he has nothing of his own to appear in ; but is forced to patch up his Figure with the Relics of the Dead , and rifle Tombstones and Monuments for Reputation . 



Philot.   Notwithstanding your rallying , I cannot conceive what crime it is to possess the Inheritance of our Forefathers . Now Honour is part of their Estate , which was raised on purpose that we might be the better for it . And since their Children were the occasion of their merit , and pushed them on to generous undertake , ought they not to share in the glory of the Success ? 



Philal.   Yes . But it should be managed with great modesty , because though an honourable Title may be conveyed to Posterity , yet the ennobling Qualities which are the Soul of Greatness , are a sort of incommunicable perfections , and cannot be transferred . Indeed if a Man could bequeath his Virtues by Will , and settle his Sense , and Learning , and Resolution , upon his Children , as certainly as he can his Lands , a brave Ancestor would be a mighty privilege . 



Philot.   I hope those fine Qualities are not so incommunicable as you suppose , for methinks there is a je ne scay quoi , in persons well born : there is a peculiar Nobleness of Temper in them , their Conversation is inimitably graceful , and a Man may distinguish their Quality by the Air of their Faces . 



Philal.   I wish that Spirit of Honour and Bravery you mention , was inseparable to their Quality ; but it is too plain that great Minds , and great Fortunes don't always go together ; however I grant there is some Truth in your observation , but am afraid the distinction does not always spring from the cause you assign . For by the gracefulness of Conversation , I suppose you mean a decent Assurance , and an Address in the Modes , and Gestures of Salutation . Now these are pretty accomplishments I confess , and recommend a Man to Company with some advantage ; but then they are easily gained by Custom and Education , and therefore we need not fetch them ex Traduce . And moreover , these little Formalities are often magnified beyond all Sense and Reason , and some People are so Fantastically fond of them , as if they were the topper perfections of Human Nature ; and that it were in reality a more valuable and gentile quality to Dress well , and come handsomely into a Room , than to take a Town , or to be fit to discharge the Office of a Privy Counsellor . Now with submission to these Ceremonious Gentlemen , I am not of their mind in this matter , but think it much better for a Man's Parts to lie in his Head , than in his Heels . 



Philot.   I think so too , but you have not answered the whole . 



Philal.   True ! Your Air was omitted : now if this was a constant privilege of Birth , which you know it is not , yet in this deceitful Age of ours , there is no Arguing from an Outside . Besides , I doubt this Advantage is sometimes the effect of a slothful and Effeminate Life . When Men will attempt nothing either in the Field , or in their Closets : when they will neither trouble themselves with Thinking , nor endure to be exposed to the Wether : This Niceness , though it renders them insignificant to the great purposes of Life , yet it Polishes their Complexion , and makes their Spirits seem more moving and transparent . Sometime this Sprightliness and Grandeur of Face , is Painted by Flattery : for when Men are once made to believe they are very Considerable , they are presently for trying to write the Inscriptions of their Quality upon their Forehead . Now Conceit when it is Corrected with a mixture of Gravity , is an admirable Wash , and will make one look as Wise , and as Great as you would wish . 



Philot.   This Grandeur of Face , as you call it , may possibly be explained upon kinder Principles ; for I am apt to believe that a quick Sense of Honour , a Consciousness of Worth , an Elevation of Thought , will sometimes break out into a Lustre , and make the great Soul sparkle in a Man's Eyes . 



Philal.   I cannot deny what you say , and therefore the best Construction aught to be made , where the known Character of the person does not disallow it . 



Philot ,  I see you can be fair when you list , therefore I shall venture to go on with you to another Advantage of Nobility , viz. Antiquity . Now to begin in your own way , Don't you think it is a great addition to ones Birth to stand at the bottom of long Parchment Pedigree , and be some yards removed from the first Escocheon ? Is not that Family substantially Built which can stand the shock of Time , and hold out against all varieties of Accidents ? How generous must that Blood be , which has been so long Refining , and run through the Channels of Honour for so many Ages , where it is sometimes as hard to come to the Plebeian Fountain : as to find out the Head of Nilus ? 



Philal.   Not so hard neither , For if you go but one Inch farther than the Gentleman at the Top you spoke of , it is ten to one but you take old Goodman , etc. by the Leathern Breeches . And as for the Antiquity of a Family , though it looks prettily at first sight , yet I fear it will abate upon examination . 



Philot.   Pray try your skill upon it , for I am not of your mind . 



Philal.   then to deal plainly with you , I conceive the Antiquity you talk of , is commonly nothing but ancient Wealth , and therefore the chief commendation of this Privilege consists in the long continued Frugality of the Family , who after they were once possessed of an Estate , had the Discretion to keep it . 



Philot.   Is it nothing then for a Man's Ancestors to have lived in Reputation , and to have had Interest and Command in their Country for so many Generations ? 



Philal.   I suppose the English of all this is no more than that they have lived in good Houses , Eat and Drank better , and born higher Offices than those who have wanted a Fortune . Now Money , and a moderate share of Sense , will furnish any Man with all these Advantages . And as to the holding out against so many Accidents , and Alterations of State , I am afraid it sometimes proceeds from shifting and indifferent Principles , and from a servile compliance with whatever is Uppermost . So that what my Lord Bacon mentions in reference to Notions and Inventions , may be sometimes applicable to Families ; where he tells us , that Time is like a River , in which Metals and solid Substances are sunk , while Chaff and Straws swim upon the Surface . 

Secondly , You are to consider that an ancient Gentility does not necessarily convey to us any advantage either of Body or Mind : and to speak like Philosophers , these are the only two things in which we are capable of any real improvement . I confess , if every Generation grew Wiser , Stronger , Handsomer , or longer Lived than the other : if the Breed of a Man's Family was thus improved , the farther it was continued ; then indeed the quality of an Escocheon would be exactly contrary to that of Clotheses , and the one would always grow better , as the other does worse , by wearing . From whence it would follow , that if the seven Sleepers had been made Gentlemen immediately before they entered their Cave , and had held on their Nap from seventy , to seven hundred years , they had most undeniably slept themselves into a considerable degree of Quality . 



Philot.   You may talk as subtly as you please , but you must not think to baffle established and uncontested Opinions , with a few Logical quirks . 



Philal.   Pray don't grow warm , and I will endeavour to satisfy you , and in order to it , I observe in the third place , That an ancient Gentility , makes a Man Superior only to those of the same Quality , ( viz. an Esquire , to an Esquire , and so in the rest ) and that in nothing but in point of Precedency . The reason , I suppose , why those which are placed in any degree of Honour , precede others who are afterwards raised to the same Height , is for the encouragement of Industry . To make Men forward to exert their earliest Endeavours to deserve well of the State ; for this reason there is a distinction made between Merit , otherwise equal , only upon the account of the Priority of Time.  



Philot.   Is this all you can afford ? 


Philal.   Look you ! We that pretend to be subject to a Constitution , must not Carve out our own Quality , for at this rate a Cobbler may make himself a Lord  



Philot.   And what then ? 


Philal.   Why , then I say , it is Vanity for any Man to have a better Opinion of his Family than the Law allows : my Reason is , because the Law is the measure of Honour , as well as of all other Civil Rights . Besides , I must tell you that it is both reasonable , and the Interest of the State that Merit should be considered , of what date soever it is . A worthy Action ought to be as much rewarded now , as one of the same kind was a thousand years since . The prospect of Honour , to a generous Mind , is the chief incitement to all great Undertake . This consideration Polishes Arts and Sciences , makes Men Industrious in improving their Understandings , and Resolute in exposing their persons , for the Public Service . If therefore we dote upon Antiquity so far , as to undervalue the Merit of the present Age , the Government must necessarily suffer by it : for such a Partiality will slacken the Nerves of Industry , and occasion a negligence both in those who have an ancient Title to Honour , and in those who have not . The first will grow sluggish , because they have a sufficient share of Reputation already ; and therefore need not run any hazards about getting more . The latter will abate in their forwardness to oblige their Country , because they know their Service , though never so great , will be contemned , and for that very Reason which ought to make them the more valued , that is , because their Considerableness came from themselves . Moreover , If the Inheritors of ancient Honour , have not by Personal Additions improved that Stock which was granted to their Ancestors ; there is no reason it should be rated above the same Degree ( Precedency excepted ) which is given now . For to affirm that a Family raised to Nobility by this King , is not as good as one raised by the Conqueror , is a reflection upon his present Majesty : it supposes his Judgement , or his Authority , lesle considerable than that of his Predecessors ; and that the Fountain of Honour is almost dried up , and runs more muddy than in former Ages . 



Philot ,  How plausibly soever you may make your opinion look , I 'm sure it has the disadvantage of being Singular . For you know a plain Gentleman of an ancient Family is accounted a Person of better Quality than a new made Knight , though the reason of his dubbing was never so Meritorious . Honour like China Dishes must lie some Ages under Ground before it comes to any Perfection . And to carry on your own Figure , the greater distance from the spring always makes the Stream the more considerable . 



Philal.   This it is to be wiser than the Laws ! And since you are for Illustrations I reply , that to suppose an ancient Title ( though lesser in degree ) is preferable to a greater of late Creation , is as if one should affirm that an old shilling is better than a new half-crown , though the Alloy and Impression are the same in both . Nay from your Argument a man may conclude that a coarser metal only by being digged and refined in the Days of our Great Grandfathers , ( though perhaps it has contracted some rust by lying ) is more valuable than the same weight in Gold but lately separated from the Oar . And that an ancient Estate is really better than one newly purchased , though the Lands of the latter are richer , and the Surveyed larger than the other . Now if a man should prove so fanciful as to demand a greater Rent for his Farm because it has been in the Possession of his Family for some hundred of years , I believe the want of Tenants would soon convince him of his Error . From whence it 's evident that in taking an Estimate of Nobility we are not so much to consider its Antiquity , as the Merit of the first Grantee , and the distinction the Prince has put upon it ; which like Figures or other marks upon Money , stamp the value , and tell the Subject for how much it is to pass . 



Philot.   Pray by your favour are not Medals , and Coins valued more for their Antiquity than their Metal ? 



Philal.   That Question is to the point ; and therefore I answer , 

First , That Coins , etc. though they are valuable as rarities , yet they signify little in Exchange and common use ; And if a man has any debt to pay , or Commodities to buy , K. Charles his Image , and superscription will do him much more service than Ce'sar's . 

Secondly , The Reason why these things are sometimes so much valued , is not because they are old but useful : They often rectify Chronology , and explain History , and retrieve us several material parts of Learning , which might otherwise have been irrecoverably lost . 

Thirdly , There is a disparity in the case of ancient Coins and Families ; For in the first you have the same numerical piece , in the latter nothing but the Name or Relation , so that the change and succession of persons seems to destroy the notion of Antiquity . To make the Instance parallel we must suppose a Gentleman as old as Methusalem , and then I confess he would be a great Curiosity , and aught to be valued accordingly . 



Philot.   As I remember you were saying , the merit of the first Gentleman of the House ought to be considered . 



Philal.   Yes , I conceive that circumstance very material , and that if upon enquiry it proves unintelligible , or unlucky , it 's no small abatement to the Family . For if he Advanced himself by a voluntary engaging in unjust Quarrels , he has no better pretence to Honour than what a resolute and successful Padder may Challenge . If he owes his Heraldry to a servile Flattery , and a dextrous Application to the vices of Princes , the marks of their Favour are rather infamous than Honourable to his Posterity , because he is ennobled for those qualities , for which he ought to have been punished . 



Philot.   What if the Gentility was purchased , I hope we may make the best of what we have paid for ? 



Philal.   By all means ! But then this is a sign that Worth and distinguishing Qualities were wanting , otherwise the Honour had been conferred Gratis . The same may be said when Arms or Titles are given at the Instance or recommendation of a Favourite , for this is downright begging for Quality , and looks more like an Alms than an Honour . Farther it 's a lessening to a man's Nobility , when the Reason and Grounds of it are unknown , for if his Rise had been derived from worthy and creditable Causes , he would in all likelihood have been as certainly acquainted with them , as with his Arms ; It being both easy and for the Reputation of the Family , that Records of this nature should have been preserved , and therefore the loss of them seems rather to proceed from Design than Neglect . In short , if the first Principles of Honour happen to be thus corpse , or sergeant , it 's not in the power of time to mend them : A Pibble or Bristol stone will not change their natures , and improve into Diamonds , though they are laid up a thousand years together . 



Philot.   Hark you Mr. I doubt your Effects ( if you have any ) have lain but a little while in the Heralds Office.  



Philal.   Probably as long as your Worships : But I take it to be much more a Gentlemanly quality to discover such unsociable mistakes than to abett them . If we are capable of understanding any thing , it must undoubtedly be more creditable to promote good humour and modesty in Conversation , and give men right Apprehensions of themselves ; than to flatter them into groundless Conceits , and make them believe they may be truly Great , and yet good for nothing . To maintain such indefensible and dangerous Principles of Honour , which not only impose upon our Understandings , but emasculate our Spirits , and spoil our Temper , and tend only to the nourishing of Idleness and Pride ; is in my opinion no very Heroical undertaking . 



Philot.   then I find we must come to the Merits of the Cause as you call them , and examine upon what foundation the Family stands . 



Philal.   I think that is the only way to know what we have to trust to , and how far we may insist upon the advantages of Birth . 



Philot.   What are the usual steps to Honour ? 



Philal.   I suppose one of these three , Learning , Commerce or Arms. The pretences of Learning have been examined already ; To which I shall only add , that if a Person whose mind is enlarged , and beautified with all sorts of useful Knowledge , is notwithstanding obliged to Modesty , and Sobriety of thought , then certainly those who claim under him , and are wise only by Proxy , ought not to grow too big upon their Relation to the Muses . To Proceed , Commerce is another Expedient which often distinguishes a man from the vulgar . For Trading raises an Estate , and that procures Honour , so that in this Case Wealth is the main of the merit , and that which is chiefly insisted on by those who inherit it . But here we ought to be very cautious and meek-spirited , till we are assured of the honesty of our Ancestors , for Covetousness and Circumvention make no good Motto for a Coat . And yet your men of Trade are too often assisted in their Fortunes by these Qualities . 



Philot.   I think you are too hard upon them , and believe they may come into their Estates by more accountable methods , viz. by their Industry , by Understanding how to make use of all fair advantages , and by the luck of a good Acquaintance . 



Philal.   I grant there is a great deal of Good Faith , Frankness and Generosity to be found among Tradesmen , and that such Professions are necessary to the convenience and splendour of Life , and being thus useful aught to be esteemed Honourable . But their being used to value small gains is apt ( without care ) to make them contract a narrowness of Spirit , and to stand too much to the point of Interest . 



Philot.   What is that which they call the Mystery of Trade ? 



Philal.   A great part of it consists in the skill of overreaching their Customers , which Science , I fear is not learned merely for Speculation . 



Philot.   Possibly it may be for Caution , that they may not be imposed on by others . 



Philal.   I am willing to think so , however these Arcana Officinae , are counted such Essentials , that except an Apprentice is fully instructed how to Adulterate , and Varnish , and give you the Go-by upon occasion , his Master may be charged with Neglect , and sued for not teaching him his Art , and his Trade . 



Philot.   It seems than he cannot be an Honest Man , except he teaches his Servant to play the Knave . 



Philal.   Granting your Inference , yet you know a Man may understand his Weapon better than his Neighbour , and notwithstanding be of a very peaceable inoffensive Temper . However , when the Rise of the Family is owing to such an Original , a Man has a particular Reason not to flourish too much upon the glitter of his Fortune , for fear there should be too much Alloy in it . For some People are forced to climb in a very mean and servile posture . They must Flatter , Deceive , and Pinch ; use their Neighbours , and themselves too , very unkindly , before they can gain their Point . So that if the Ancestor had not been remarkably Little , his Posterity had never been reputed Great . 



Philot.   But what needs all this Scruple ? Why should I inquire so anxiously how my Ancestors came by their Estate ? Let their Merit be as small as you please , the Revenue will not sink upon this Score . Now , if you considered the Sovereignty of Money , how it commands Honour , and Beauty , and Power , how much of Ornament , and Defence , and Pleasure there is in it ; you would allow us to be a little Uppish upon the Matter : for when a Man has such a Universal Instrument of Delight , and is Master of that , which is Master of every thing else , he ought visibly to Congratulate his Happiness , and pay himself a particular Respect . 



Philal.   If I could purchase a parcel of new Senses , and some pretty undiscovered Curiosities to please them with , I confess I should be more desirous of growing Rich than I am . 



Philot.   What though you cannot buy any new , you may please the old ones better , and make one Sense go as far as two , with Poverty . 



Philal.   I am not altogether of your mind ; besides if my Understanding does not improve proportionably , I am only in the fairer way to be more a Brutus . 



Philot.   Understanding ! Money will buy good Books , and though the Owner should should not know how to use them , yet if has an Estate , he will never want People to make him believe he has Sense , which will be in a manner as well , for Pleasure consists mostly in Fancy . 



Philal.   I don't envy such a one the entertainment of his Imagination , though I believe it is much short of the transports of Lunacy : but withal I think that folly and madness are no proper Judges to pronounce upon the Advancements of human Nature . But to return to the Argument , no person can be Great by being Owner of those things which wise Men have always counted it a piece of greatness to despise . To which I must add , that it is not the possessing , but the right management of any valuable Advantage which makes us Considerable . He that does not employ his Fortune generously , is not to be respected merely because he has it . Indeed if a Man gives me part of his Estate , I am bound to make him an acknowledgement ; but I am not obliged to honour him because he is pleased to keep it to himself . 



Philot.   Well! Since Merchandise is sometimes liable to exceptions , and ancient Wealth has no right to challenge Worship , and Homage . Pray what do you think of Nobility raised by Arms ? I hope here you will grant the Materials are all shining , and solid . And when an Ancestor works out his Fortune by great and hazardous Undertake , by contempt of Danger and Death , and all the instances of an Heroic Gallantry ; is it not highly reasonable his Descendants should share his Honour , as well as his Inheritance ? Nay , they seem obliged , in justice to his Memory , to have some strokes of Greatness and Reserve in their Carriage . They might better be Profuse in their Expenses , than their Familiarities . The wasting his Estate , and razing him out of the Herald's Books , is scarce more injurious to his Name , than the heedless Condescensions of his Family . For by such ill managed Humility , they do as it were Prostitute his Quality , mingle his Ashes with ignoble Dust , and deface the Monuments and Distinctions of his Merit . 



Philal.   I confess a Man ought to be civil to his Generation , but not to that degree as to plague the Living , only in Ceremony to the Dead . And I may say farther , that a Noble Ancestor , does not desire his Posterity should pretend to honour him this way , except his Qualities , as well as his Name descend upon them . A person truly Great , is never fond and unreasonable ; he hate's to see Folly Idolised , though it be in his own Children ; and had rather have his Memory buried in Oblivion , than his Honour should be Usurped by a Degenerate insignificant Offspring . Besides , the reasons you assign why Martial Men ought to be valued by after-ages , seem to be common to other pretences to Nobility . 



Philot.   I am sorry if they appear so , since I designed them chiefly for the advantage of Arms. For in my judgement , the Profession of a Soldier has a particular , and paramount Title to Honor. For can there be a more extraordinary instance of Greatness , than for a Man to be undismayed amid so many horrible Instruments and Images of Death ? To expose his person as freely as if he knew himself immortal , and to fear nothing but Obscurity and Disgrace ? And therefore though there are many other creditable Employments and Accomplishments , yet there is a transcendent , and almost an astonishing Greatness and Gracefulness in Valour . It has something more illustrious and sparkling , more Noble and Majestic than the rest . 



Philal.   Hold ! You are going to describe Alexander or Cesar ; do you think that every Field , or Charge in Gules , can pretend to all these fine things ? This must be examined farther by and by : at present I shall only observe to you , that though I have a great esteem for a Gentleman of the Sword , and don 't in the least intent to lessen the just Character of Military Glory ; yet I conceive there is another Profession , which possibly does not glitter altogether so much upon the Sense , but for all that , if you touch it 't will prove right Sterling . 



Philot.   What Profession do you mean ? 


Philal.   That of Learning ; therefore if you please , I will just glance upon the Advantages of Learning without interposing my judgement by way of comparison . 



Philot.   Do so , for I think you had need say some kind things upon this Argument , to make amends for the freedom you took with it in our former Conference . 



Philal.   Don't mistake me , I am conscious of no Injury , and therefore design nothing by way of Reparation . 



Philot.   Take your Course . 


Philal.   1.  Than not to mention that Learning is an improvement of our Minds , which is the noblest part of us . I say not to mention this , you may please to take notice , that without some share in this accomplishment , War itself cannot be successfully managed . Without the assistance of Letters , a Man can never be qualified for any considerable Post in the Camp. For Courage and Corporal Force , unless joined with Conduct , and reach of Thought ( which are the usual effects of Contemplation ) is no more fit to command than a Tempest ; doing for the most part more harm than good , and destroying itself by its blind and ill directed motion . It is Learning which teaches a General the successes and events of Action in former Ages , which makes him better able to judge of his present preparation . It instructs him how to take advantage of his Enemies , and avoid those miscarriages which have been fatal to others before him . It teaches him how to Fortify and Assault , how to manage the difference of Ground and Wether . It let's him into the knowledge of Human Nature , and shows him how to understand the Tempers of other men , and to govern his own . It discovers by what secret Spring's the Passions are moved , what are the most probable Causes of Hope and Fear , of Resolution and Cowardice ; and how strangely they are mixed , and varied according to the difference of Climates , Governments , Conditions , and Occupations , especially according to the different Age , Temper , Interest , and Experience of those who are in Power . 



Philot.   Yes , no doubt it teaches a Man to take a Soul in pieces , as easily as a Watch ! If ever I heard such Conjuring ! 



Philal.   Pray be not so sharp , the Discourse is not so Romantic as you suppose . 



Philot.   Go on . 


Philal.   Secondly , I observe that the Advantages of Learning are more lasting and extensive than those of Arms. The Courage of a Soldier , does his Country not much service after his death , the benefit of it being usually confined to one Age : whereas by the knowledge of Men and Things , Public Provisions for Society are framed , and the Constitution adjusted to the Temper , and Convenience of the People ; of the happy effects of which , remote Posterity is often sensible . And as the Consequences of Valour , seldom reach beyond the death of him who showed it , so there are few the better for it , except those a Man engages for ; which are commonly none but his Countrymen . But Learning , by inventing and improving Arts and Sciences , scatters its Favours in a much larger compass ; becomes a universal Benefactor , and obliges mankind in its most comprehensive Latitude of Place and Time.  



Philot.   I hope you will grant that Learning must fly to the Protection of the Sword to secure its quiet , and all the profits accrueing from thence . For in earnest , Notions , and Syllogisms , are very defenceless things against Violence . If we had nothing but Philosophy , Statutes and Reports , to secure the Peace ; our Meum and Tuum were but in an ill condition . 



Philal.   I agree with you , and shall just add in the third place , That the successes of Learning are naturally of a very innocent Tendency , and under good management prejudicial to none . The Conquests of Arts are not like those of Arms , gained by slaughter , and attended with ruin and desolation . no , Here is nothing routed but Ignorance and Error , nothing destroyed but obstinate Humour , and savage Disposition : Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros . 

But a Martial Man , except he has been sweetened , and polished by a Lettered Education , is apt to have a tincture of sourness , and incomplyance in his Behaviour . And therefore if you observe your old Heroes in Homer , ( for want of being Book-learned ) were none of the Gentilest Men. What a rugged tempestuous , unconversable Mortal was Achilles ; I could never fancy that same ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰ ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰ ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰ ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰ ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰ . 



Philot.   Well! I perceive it is requisite for a Man to get some Sense to his Courage if he can : but have we not lost all our Pride , and gone somewhat off from the Point ? 



Philal.   no , We have only fetched a Compass , and thrown our reasoning more into a Circle to invest the Place ; and now we will come on directly , and make a little Assault , only to try the strength of the Garrison . 



Philot.   Very Soldierlike ! In plain English I doubt you are attempting to show that it is not so much the Profession of Arms , as the unexceptionable management of that Profession which makes a Family honourable . 



Philal.   Yes . Therefore before we fall too much in love with the Buff in the Wardrobe ; we should examine whether the War was just , whether our Ancestor fought in defence of his Prince and Country , or let himself out to any person who would hire him to murder . We should consider whether the Enterprise was Great and Dangerous ; whether the Advantages were gained by open Bravery and Resolution , or were no more than the effects of Chance , of Treachery , or Surprise . And though a Man can give a creditable Answer to all these Questions , he should then remember there are a great many persons who have ventured as far as himself , and yet continue in their first Obscurity : so that had it not been his good Fortune to have fallen under the Notice of his General , his Merit had been unrewarded . There are many persons who perform signal service in a Breach , or Scalado , and yet their Courage is often unregarded , and lost in the Crowd , and Tumult of the Action , so that they get nothing but Blows for their Pains . To wind up this part of the Discourse : let the Rise of the Family be never so considerable ( I mean none but Subjects ) it ought not to supersede the Industry , or stop the Progress of those who are thence Descended . For if we rely wholly upon the Merit of others , and are Great only by imputation , we shall be esteemed by none but the injudicious part of the World. To speak out , if neither the advantages of Fortune and Education ( which often concur in these Cases ) the expectation of others , nor the Memory of worthy Ancestors , if none of these Motives can prevail with a Man to furnish himself with Supravulgar and Noble Qualities , this is an argument that he is either under a natural incapacity , or else has abandoned himself to Sloth , and Luxury . And without dispute he is most emphatically mean , who is so under the greatest advantages and arguments to the contrary . So that the Lustre of his Family serves only to set off his own Degeneracy , it does Facem proeferre pudendis and makes him the more remarkably Contemptible . 



Philot.   You are smart upon the empty Sparks ! And I perceive by your discourse that if we intent to set up strong , we must do something for ourselves . 



Philal.   Yes : And therefore I presume that Women have more reason to insist upon their Birth than Men : because they have not so fair a trial to discover their worth . They are by custom made incapable of those employments by which Honour is usually gained . They are shut out from the Pulpit and Barr , from Embassies , and State Negotiations , so that notwithstanding ( as I believe it often happens ) their Inclinations are generous , and their Abilities great , to serve the public ; yet they have not an opportunity of showing it . 



Philot.   Truly I think you need not have been so liberal to the Beau-sex ; you know they have enough to be proud of besides Heraldry . 



Philal.   What do you mean ? 


Philot.   Their Beauty Man  


Philal.   Right , I believe that may disturb them sometimes ; but they have no great reason for it . For Beauty though it 's a pretty varnish , yet it 's of a frail Constitution , liable to abundance of Accidents , and but a short lived Blessing at the best . And waving this Consideration , it seems to be made chiefly for the entertainment of the lookers on . Those who are so much admired by others , can't share the pleasure of the Company without the help of a Glass ; for the Eyes which show us other Objects cannot see themselves . Nature seems to have laid the most graceful parts of our Fabric out of our way ; to prevent our vanity . For could some People always command a sight of their Faces , they would Narcissus like be perpetually poring upon their Handsomeness , and so be neither fit for Business , nor Company . 



Philot.   To my thinking you have not cleared the Point ; For why may we not insist upon the privileges of Nature ? Why should a fine Woman be so prodigal of her Beauty , make strip and waste of her Complexion , and squander away her Face for nothing ? There is no reason persons of a lesle agreeable aspect ( except they have some other advantage ) should converse with beauty upon a Level . For those who cannot furnish out an equal proportion towards the pleasure of Conversation , aught to pay for their insufficiency in Acknowledgements . Beauty without doubt was designed for some advantage , and if so , certainly the Owners have the best right to it . 



Philal.   I grant it ; and therefore it 's allowable for them to set a value upon their persons , for the better disposal of them . And farther if they have a mind to it , they may please themselves , because they are acceptable to others , which is a generous satisfaction : But when they grow humoursom they spoil all ; For Pride not only raises a prejudice against their Beauty , but really lessens it . For if you observe , it paints an illnatured Air upon their Face ; and fills them with spleen and peevishness and passion , which exhausts their Spirits , and makes their blood lesle florid , so that their Beauty is neither so agreeable nor lasting as otherwise it would be . And if the present inconvenience will not cure them , they will do well to remember that they must of necessity grow humble when they are old ; unless they are so fanciful as to dote upon Rubbish and Ruins . 



Philot.   Pray let us take leave of the Ladies , and proceed to the other branch of your Division , viz. to acquired Nobility . And here methinks every thing looks unexceptionable and fine upon your own Principles . For here we are beholden to none but ourselves ; we are not thrown up the Hill by another's Arms , and made considerable by Diversion , or Chancemedly ; but climb the ascent by plain Strength , and indesatigable Activity . Is it not a singular commendation to have our circumstances not only large and Honourable , but Independent ; and almost to create the privileges we enjoy ? Here is no gild of a corpse substance , no borrowed Glory , no faint Reflection from an Ancestor , but the Man is all bright and luminous to the Centre , and shines and sparkles in his own worth . He is not Great by Genealogy and ancient Title , by the Favour of Fortune and the Labours of those he never helped , but by Nature and Performances , by having Greatness incorporated in himself . Now may not a Person who has thus distinguished himself by his Merit , make use of the Honour which has been so justly conferred upon him , and put the Lazy and lesle significant in mind of their Defects ? 



Philal.   If you recollect yourself you will find that this point concerning Acquired Nobility has been occasionally discoursed already : Therefore I shall only add that upon supposition a Man has obliged the Public , and is remarkable for great Abilities and a generous Use of them ; he would do well to remember that there are others who have ventured as far , and performed as considerably as himself , whose Services all miscarried as to any private Advantage , because they were not so lucky as to act under the Notice of those who were able to reward : And that many persons well furnished for Employment and Honour , go out of the World as obscurely as they came in ; only for want of a proper opportunity to bring them into Light , and public View . 



Philot.   What though some People are unlucky , ought their misfortunes to be pleaded to the prejudice of Desert in others ? 



Philal.   No. But when a man has received so valuable a consideration for his Service as Honour and Estate , he ought to acquiesce , and not press too arbitrarily for Submission . He should not set a tax upon his Conversation , and put the Company under Contribution for Respect . Besides a Gentleman of the first Head has a particular reason to manage his Advancement obligingly : For by treating the little People roughly , he does in effect but expose his Ancestors and reproach his own former Condition . 



Philot.   You have so many fetches with you ! But what do you think of Magistrates ? In my opinion those who represent their Prince , and are the Ministers of Justice , cannot practise that Humility and Condescension you seem to admire , with any manner of Decency , or Security to the public . For if they don't oblige their Inferiors to Distance , their Reputation will sink , and the Majesty of the Government will be lessened , and then it 's easy to guests what the consequence must be . 



Philal.   I agree with you : Magistrates ought to assert their Office , and not make themselves cheap by improper Familiarities . But their Character may be over-strained . To prevent which inconvenience they may please to remember that their power was given them upon a public account , more for the benefit of others than themselves . They are deputed by their Prince , for the countenancing of Virtue , for the ease and Protection of the People , and therefore they should discourage none who are regular and fair , they should show their Authority upon nothing but Insolence and Injustice , Thiefs and Malefactors ; upon those who affronted the Government , or break the Peace . There is no necessity they should bring the Air of the Bench into common Conversation , and wear their Commissions always upon their Faces . To manage their Power thus singularly looks like a little private Design of setting up for themselves ; as if they procured their Authority to fright the King's Liege Subjects , and to over-awe the Neighbourhood into a greater Reverence . 



Philot.   But if they should happen to take too much upon them , are the People to slight them upon this account ? 



Philal.   By no means : the Authority ought to be considered let the Men be what they william However in general I observe that the best way to secure Observance , is not to insist too violently upon it . For Pride is a most unfortunate Vice , other Immoralities usually gain their Point , though they lose more another way ; but a Proud man is so far from making himself Great by his haughty and contemptuous Port , that he is usually punished with Neglect for it : and that Disdain with which he treats others , is returned more justly upon himself : which may be done without much difficulty , in regard Honour is not become a property so far as to have all its Appurtenances bounded and fixed by Law. The Circumstantials and oftentimes the most pompous part of Ceremony , are arbitrary and undetermined . For we are not told either by Statute , or Common Law how many Bows a Superior of such a degree may expect from us , nor how low we are to make them , nor how often the terms of Respect are to be used in our Application . 



Philot.   What do you mean ? 



Philal.   I mean that it is not settled by Act of Parliament , how many Sirs and Madams , a Discourse of such a length is to be sprinkled with ; and therefore a cross-grained Fellow , will tell you he has his Betters upon their Good Behaviour : if he likes their humour , he will be as liberal to them in acknowledgements as they please ; if not , he shall take the freedom to hold his hand , and let them help themselves how they can . 



Philot.   Well! I cannot reconcile this selfdenying Humour you are contending for to the Character of a Gentleman . Such an untoward management of Fortune and Honour as this is , argues either that a Man wants Sense to understand his Condition , or Spirit to maintain it . To throw away the Prerogatives of our Birth , or the rewards of our Industry , at such a careless Cynical rate , is a sign of a Rustic inapprehensive meanness , and that we have not the least inclination to Greatness in us . For those who desire to be Great , will endeavour to excel , and those who excel will be sure to show it ; for the Essence of Greatness lies in Comparison . A tall Man loses the advantage of his Stature , unless he stands straight , and overlooks his Neighbour . 



Philal.   Methinks you are somewhat out in your notion of Greatness . 



Philot.   Let us hear if you can hit it better . 



Philal.   To speak freely , I conceive it a much more substantial and better natured thing than you have made it . Greatness certainly does not consist in Pageantry and Show , in Pomp and Retinue ; and though a person of Quality will make use of these things to avoid Singularity , and to put the Vulgar in mind of their obedience to Authority , yet he does not think himself really the bigger for them : for he knows that those who have neither Honesty nor Understanding , have oftentimes all this fine Furniture about them . Farther , To be Great , is not to be starched , and formal , and supercilious , to swagger at our Footmen , and browbeat our Inferiors . Such a Behaviour looks as if a Man was conscious of his own insignificancy , and that he had nothing but Outside , and Noise , and ill Humour , to make himself Considerable with . But he that is truly Noble , has far different Sentiments , and turns his Figure quite another way . He hate's to abridge the Liberties , to depress the Spirits , or any ways to impair the satisfaction of his Neighbour . His Greatness is easy , obliging , and agreeable , so that none have any just cause to wish it lesle . And though he has a general kindness for all Men , though he despises not the meanest Mortal , but desires to stand fair in the Opinion of the World , yet he never court's any Man's Favour at the Expense of Justice , nor strikes in with a Popular Mistake . no , He is sensible it is the part of true Magnanimity to adhere unalterably to a wise Choice : not to be overrun by Noise and Numbers , but to appear in defence of injured Right , of neglected Truth , notwithstanding all the Censure and Disadvantage they may sometimes lie under . To conclude his Character , A Great Man is affable in his Converse , generous in his Temper , and immoveable in what he has maturely resolved upon . And as Prosperity does not make him haughty and imperious , so neither does Adversity sink him into meanness and dejection : for if ever he shows more spirit than ordinary , it is when he is ill used , and the World frowns upon him . In short , he is equally removed from the extremes of Servility and Pride ; and scorns either to trample upon a Worm , or sneak to an Emperor . 



Philot.   In earnest , you have described a Person of Honour : And I am so far pleased with the Character , that I would give all I am Master of to make it my own . But can we receive no other Advantages from Nobility , but what have been hinted already ? 



Philal.   All that I can think of at present , are these following . 

First , It gives a fair occasion to excite the generosity of our Minds , and disposes us to the imitation of great Examples , that so we may not seem unworthy our Predecessors . Indeed , a Man is bound in justice not to impair the Reputation , not spoil the Breed of the Family : but to hand down the Line to his Posterity , at least with the same good Conditions he received it . 

Secondly , These Privileges of Birth may serve to check an insolent Humour in others , who behave themselves contemptuously towards us upon lesser , or but equal pretences . 

Thirdly , A Man may make some Advantage this way , when he falls undeservedly under Public Disgrace , or is unrighteously Oppressed . For in such a Case , the mention of his Ancestors seems free from all suspicion of Vanity , and may fairly be interpreted to proceed either from self-defence , or greatness of Spirit . 

Fourthly , The same may be done when any Office or Promotion , may Legally be claimed by virtue of an honourable Condition . For example , If a Man should put in to be one of the Knights of Malta , he might modestly enough publish his Pedigree , and prove his six Descents , against a lesle qualified Competitor . 



Philot.   If you are at a stop , I think I can carry your concessions somewhat farther . For , as I remember , it has been granted already , that the common People may pay a Respect to Quality , though you mortify the Pleasure a little severely in those who receive it . 



Philal.   May pay a Respect , call you it ? I say they must . For not to mention that Gentlemen have generally a greater share of Fortune and Sense too , than those of vulgar Condition ; not to mention this I say , if they had nothing to pled but their Quality , they ought to be regarded upon that Score , because the State sets a value upon it , and that for public and considerable Reasons . 



Philot.   I perceive if a Man will but stay and hear you out , you are civil enough at the last . Pray what are we to do next ? 



Philal.   Why , now I could run a Discourse with you upon the inconveniences of Pride : and snew you in particular , what an unconquerable Aversion it gives all Mankind against us , when we are overgrown with it . How it multiplies , and conceals our Defects from us , and makes us do a thousand silly things , without taking notice of them . How it makes us a Prey to Flatterers , and puts us to great Expenses only to be laughed at . I might debate with you , how it spoils Conversation , and takes away the pleasure of Society . How often Families , Kingdoms , and Churches are embroiled , and the World turned topsiturvy by this Vice. These and many other ill consequences of Pride might be enlarged upon ; but this part of the Argument is , I conceive , more proper for Divines , and therefore I shall pursue it no farther . 



Philot.   Well moved ! For now I think it is almost time to give over . 



Philal.   I won't tyre you . 



Your humble Servant .
