A letter to the King . 

Let thy mind oh King , attend on reading , hearing , and instruction and reject not the counsel of the Lord spoken to thee by his servants and handmaids , but mind it till thou art truly reform into the way of truth and life of him that brings salvation near , thorough the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ ; which gospel is to be preached to all nations before the end come , though it be foolishness to that wisdom that stands not in the power and demonstration of the spirit that gives life and liberty to the just ; for the world by wisdom knew not God , and it pleased him by his infinite wisdom thorough the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe ; and this is the infinite wisdom of the invisible wise God , who is incomprehensible and full of glory ; oh this infinite wise God , that founded all things in wisdom , and man by his earthly knowledge cannot find it out ; this is he that hath given unto us a saviour , him that is the light to lighten the gentiles , and to be his salvation to the ends of the earth ; and all must come to the measure of him in themselves , to the manifestation of his pure spirit , which is truth and life , that comes to know the depth of the wisdom of God ; the mystery of this kingdom stands not in words , but in power , and demonstration of the pure spirit of life , which spirit breathes thorough and helps the infirmity of all that trust to it , and believes in it ; and blessed are all they that are joined to it , for it ever lives to make intercession with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered . 

So dear friend , if thou wilt be endowed with pure wisdom from above , wait in love and soberness of mind , to receive the spirit of life from God , and that is more than all the world , and will be more comfort to thy soul , than all the dominions that the earth can afford ; for the first man is but of the earth earthly , but the second is the Lord from heaven , the quickening spirit , which spirit if it be received , is it that works the reformation , for it is grieved with evil where ever it meets with it , at home or abroad ; & so long as iniquity bears rule , it suffers , & it interceeds unto God from whence it came : oh dear friend , that this were descended into thy lowermost part• , that thou Mightst feel him rise , and eternally know the power of his resurrection , then assuredly thou wouldst suffer no evil to be done in thy name , nor in thy nation , and then the fruit of thy goodness would spring forth , and thy glory and renown spread unto the nations round about thee , and this wholesome wisdom would be a crown of glory to thee , and as a royal diamond in the hand of the Lord thou wouldst be found , and thy name would be had in everlasting remembrance , with succeeding generations ; which if thou dost not mind the glory of the Lord , and be tender of the birth immortal , and relieve the oppressed ; then thy name will •ot , as others that is gone before thee . 

Oh therefore seek the glory of God , and the good of his persons , that thy soul May live and be refreshed with his virtue ; so with diligence and suffering , wait to know the coming of the just one in thy own particular , the manifestations of his eternal spirit , that thou Mayst answer his love , which must be with his own , if ever thou please him , who thou seest rends the kingdom from men , and overturns , and will overturn till he come to reign whose right it is , even them that will fear him , that they May give glory to his name . 

So dear heart , as the Lord's love hath been large unto you , mind the wisdom that will answer his dear goodness unto you ; for it was his love indeed unto you , and great cause you have to remember it , and not to let his benefits slip out of your mind , lest you forget his goodness which hath been great unto you ; for this i can say , who am the least of many thousands , as in the mystery and life of truth , which reveals the secrets of the Lord , that i saw and felt in the spirit that reacheth over sea and land , your coming before you came , and my spirit breathed to the Lord for you ; and i felt three , and one was a woman , and that i spoke of then , that my spirit reached forth unto three ; and they said you were three brethren , but i said that one of the three that i felt was a woman , and still that did abide with me ; and now that you are come , my spirit breathes to the Lord , desiring him to subdue that in you , that will not glorify him , that the kingdoms May not be rent from you ; so mind the fear , and remember how he rent the kingdoms from Saul because of his disobedience , and he is the same still , holy and pure , and though he wait to be gracious , yet he will not always strive with man , but he will take to him his great power , and rend the kingdom from man , and will overturn , overturn , till he come to reign whose right it is , the son of equity the King of justice ; so in love •nd fear rule the nations , that thou Mayst be found in the land of the living . 

From a lover of thy soul , Anne Clayton .
