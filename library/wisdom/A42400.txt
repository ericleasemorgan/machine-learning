A warning to all the world , by Anne Gargel . 

A warning to all priests & persons ; the Lord is burdened with your iniquities , the Lord God will overthrow your table of idols , and the imagination of your hearts shall be confounded ; the Lord God will call to an account your abomination , and the workers of iniquity shall be confounded ; the Lord is going about to search all hearts ; the dominion of the ungodly , shall be overthrown , and the wisdom of God revealed to the simple , & the prudence of the serpent brought to naught ; the subtle shall be confounded in their own snares , and the wisdom of the eternal God shall stand for ever ; the pure in heart shall see God and live for ever , and the adulterous woman shall be confounded : long hath the heritage of the Lord lain wast , through the abomination of the harlot ; but now shall the innocent judge the whore , her reward shall be doubled and her pride brought to naught , and the merchants of the earth shall howl over her , their profession shall be taken away ; the abominations of all hearts is known to the Lord , their wisdom is accursed : the bitter root shall be removed , and the plant of the innocent shall stand , and the wisdom of God shall guide the pure ; the eternal plant of the Lord shall live for ever . Mind the wisdom of God to guide your minds ; the light of Christ that showeth sin and evil , by it to be guided , till the imaginations of your hearts be destroyed , and subtlety cease , and the dead shall rise , and wisdom set up . In stead of the Lord you have obeyed subtlety , and the lamb lain slain under the abomination of your hearts : now shall the Lord arise and call to an account the heathen , and the innocent that hath been slain shall judge the whore , and reward her double . The righteous soul of Lot was grieved at the abomination of Sodom ; the Lord alone delivered him , by the wisdom of God he was preserved , and the whole world was overthrown . Abide in the wisdom of God , oh ye simple , that the innocent May be preserved , and the power of God known to confound all your enemies , the lust of the flesh , and the pride of life ; that the bands of iniquity May be loosed , and the prisoner set free , and the lamb upon his throne . The heritage of the Lord hath long lain wast , the seditious seed of the devil hath ruled . No longer will the Lord bear with your abomination , he will confound your wisdom , and bring to naught your pride , the simple shall confound your wisdom , and your shame shall be made manifest to all that dwell in the light of the lamb ; your deceit is known to the pure God ; he shall confound your wisdom and bring to naught your pride , the workers of iniquities shall be blasted , and their paths consumed ; and the throned in the hearts of the innocent ; he that denies God shall be ashamed in the day of his power , when he comes to reckon with all flesh ; the potentates of the earth shall be confounded , and their glory brought to naught . In the presence of the lamb can they not stand , for the Lord alone shall be exalted ; oh ye bubbles : why do ye rebel against God ? why is your hearts exalted against the innocent that calls for purity ? the light of the lamb discovers the deceits of your hearts , and will judge you in secret when you rebel against God the pure God sees you all , nothing is hide from the lamb's presence ; his presence is pure and holy , and no unclean thing can stand before him ; wherefore return to the Lord , dwell in that which discovers sin ; then shall the wisdom of God be made manifest , & his power known to cleanse your hearts , and to make manifest the works of the devil to be the enemy of your souls , that long hath been exalted above the innocent , and the pure God hath not been known ; your wisdom hath been exalted , & the innocent burdened , and the lamb's power not known ; pure is God , and will bear your iniquities no longer , your tables of idols shall be overwhelmed , and the righteous shall reign : in the day of the Lord's power shall his enemies be made his footstool , and the worker , of iniquity shall be confounded ; and over all shall the lamb reign ; he shall bring to confusion the counsel of your hearts , and the builders of Babel shall be destroyed . Blessed is that man that fears the Lord , by his wisdom shall he be guided . Dwell in wisdom all ye simple of the Lord , till purity is throned , and the glory of the Lord is seen to confound your wisdom , that hath been exalted against God , that the lamb May judge and bring to naught the haughtiness of man : and all that hath been exalted against the innocent ; the 〈◊〉 God hath born your iniquities , long and patient hath the Lord been , but now the innocent shall reign , the whole earth shall witness his power , and the wisdom of God shall be made manifest , the haughtiness of man shall be confounded ; the Lord shall guide the hearts of the simple , and dwell with them of low degree ; the ceaders shall be cut down , and the plant of the Lord shall stand , and his wisdom shall guide the heart of the innocent , who dwells in the light of the lamb , by it to be guided ; the exceeding wisdom of God will dwell with the poor , and the rich shall be sent empty away ; he that is abased shall be exalted , he dwells in the hearts of the lowly , and the lofty to him is not known ; he that waits on God for wisdom , shall renew his strength , and the pure in spirit shall see God and live ; the proud he beholdeth a far off , therefore shall your haughtiness be judged of the Lord , and innocence shall overspread the nation , and the lamb shall be throned for ever in the hearts of the obedient : obey God all ye ceaders , let the imaginations of your hearts be confounded ; your shame shall appear to all men ; the Lord shall establish the heart of the innocent , who by him is guided ; the eternal God is wisdom , and his peace is end loss ; and purity shall possess the hearts of those that fear him ; his glory shall never decay , his plant of renown shall stand for ever : the root of the devil shall be abased , that proceedeth from the lust and concupiscence of man that was by Adam's fall , the fall of Adam maketh desolate : the resurrection of the Lord is pure , and purity possesseth the light of the lamb ; the lambs purity is peace , and the world's glory is shame ; therefore be ashamed you ungodly beasts , and mind the light of the lamb you to guide , that your bodies May be cleansed from dead works , to serve the living God , and cease from vanity , and obey the living God , who hath given every one a talon ; the Lord shall be clear of your blood at the latter day , when a reckoning shall be made with all flesh , to consume his enemies who hath trodden on the innocent , and lent his ear to the wicked , by it to be guided , while the heritage of the Lord hath lain wast ; therefore shall the Lord consume his enemies , and bring to naught their wisdom , and the lamb shall be throned in the hearts of the simple for ever & ever . blessed is the man that fears the Lord , he shall be as a lantern to his paths .
