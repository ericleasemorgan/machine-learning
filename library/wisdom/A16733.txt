TO THE Honourable , and my much worthy honoured , truly learned , and judicious Knight , Sir Francis Bacon , his Ma ties Attorney General , Increase of honour , health , and eternal happiness . 

WORTHY Knight , I have read of many Essays , and a kind of Charactering of them , by such , as when I looked into the form , or nature of their writing , I have been of the conceit , that they were but Imitators of your breaking the ice to their inventions ; which , how short they fall of your worth , I had rather think than speak , though Truth need not blush at her blame : Now , for myself unworthy to touch near the Rock of those Diamonds , or to speak in their praise , who so far exceed the power of my capacity , vouchsafe me leave yet , I beseech you , among those Apes that would counterfeit the actions of men , to play the like part with learning , and as a Monkey , that would make a face like a Man , and cannot , so to write like a Scholar , and am not : and thus not daring to adventure the Print , under your Patronage , without your favourable allowance , in the devoted service of my bounden duty , I leave these poor Travels of my Spirit , to the perusing of your pleasing leisure , with the further fruits of my humble affection , to the happy employment of your honourable pleasure . 

At your service in all humbleness NICH : BRETON . 

To the Reader . 

READ what you list , and understand what you can : Characters are not every man's construction , though they be written in our mother tongue : and what I have written , being of no other nature , if they fit not your humour , they may please a better : I make no comparison , because I know you not , but if you will vouchsafe to look into them , it may be you may find something in them ; their natures are diverse , as you may see , if your eyes be open , and if you can make use of them to good purpose , your wits may prove the better : In brief , fearing the fool will be put upon me , for being too busy with matters too far above my understanding , I will leave my imperfection to pardon , or correction , and my labour to their liking , that will not think ill of a well meaning : and so rest 

Your well-willing friend , N.B.  

Who reads this Book with a judicious eye , 
Will in true judgement , true discretion try , 
Where words and matter close and sweetly couched , 
Do show how truth , wit , art , and nature touched . 
What need more words these Characters to praise , 
They are the true charactering of Essays . 
I.R.  

IN words of worth , to speak of these Essays 
Let this suffice , the work itself will praise . 
C.N.  

Some have an humour , that to discommend 
They know themselves , they know not how to mend . 
Other correct , what they do think amiss : 
While in their own conceit the error is . 
But true judicious wits , and honest minds , 
Will give their censure in some better kinds : 
And say but truth , that cannot be mistook : 
Wit hath well labour the learning in this Book .

Ad Authorem . 

HE that shall read thy characters ( Nic : Breton ) 
And weigh them well ; must say they are well written . 
They taste the lamp : much reading , observation , 
Art , matter , wit , all worthy commendation . 
Some wove their lines of such a slender thread , 
They will not last so long , as to be read . 
thou hast so spun , so weaved ; thy words , thy lines 
They please us most being viewed , a hundred times .

In laudem operis . 

Word's are the pencils , whereby drawn we sinde 
The picture of the inward man , the mind . 
Such thoughts , such words ; such words , such is the man 
Say ; is this Spirit a Plebeian ? 
That like the singing Lark doth mount so high , 
We cannot reach them with an earthly eye . 
W.P.  

While I Essay to character this Book , 
And th●se charactered Essays o'relooke : 
I herein find few words , great worth involve : 
A Lip●o● stile , terse Phrase : and so resolve , 
That as a stone 's best valued , and best prised , 
When best in known : So this , when best revised

Wisdom . 

WISDOM is a working Grace in the Souls of the Elect : by whom the Spirit is made capable of those secrets , that neither Nature , nor Reason , is able to comprehend : who , by a powerful virtue , She hath from the divine Essence , worketh in all things , according to the will of the Almighty : and , being , before beginning , shall exceed Time , in an eternal proceeding : She is a Light , in the Intellectual part , by which Reason is led to direct the Senses in their due Course , and Nature is preserved from Subiecting herself to Imperfection : in the Creation , She was of Council with the Trinity , in the pleasing of the Deity , in the Redemption , the Inventer of Mercy , for , the preservation of the Elect , and in the Glorification , the Treasurer of life , for the reward of the faithful , who , having committed to her Care , the carriage of the whole Motion , finding the disposition of earth in all the Children of her Womb , by such a Measure , as she finds fitting their quality , she gives them either the grace of Nature , or the glory of Reason : While being the Mother of the Graces , She gives them that holy Instruction , that , in the knowledge of the highest Love , through the paths of Virtue , makes a passage to Heaven : Learning hath from her , that knowledge without the which , all knowledge , is mere Ignorance : while , only , in the Grace of Truth , is seen the Glory of understanding : Knowledge hath from Her that Learning , whereby , she is taught the direction of her Love , in the way of life : Understanding hath from her that Knowledge , that keeps Conceit , always in the Spirits comfort : and Judgement , from Understanding , that Rule of justice , that by the even weight of Impartiality , shows the hand of Heaven in the heart of Humanity : in the Heavens , She keeps the Angels in their orders , teacheth them the Natures of their Offices , and emploies them in the service of their Creator : in the Firmament , She walks among the Stars , sets , and keeps them , in their places , courses , and operations , at her pleasure , She eclipseth the light , and , in a Moment , leaves not a Cloud in the ●kie : in Her Thunders , and Lightnings she shows the Terror of the Highest Wrath , and in Her temperate Calms , the patience of his Mercy : in her frosty Winters , she shows the weakness of Nature , and in her Sunny Springs , the Recovery of Her health : in the Lovers of this world lives no part of her pureness , but , with Her beloved She makes a Heaven upon Earth : in the King , she shows her Grace , in his Council her Care , and , in his State , her Strength : in the Soldier , she shows Virtue , the truest Valour , in the Lawyer , Truth , the Honour of his Plea , in the Merchant , Conscience , the wealth of his Soul , and in the Churchman Charity , the true fruit of his Devotion : She lives in the World , but , not the world's Love , for the World's unworthiness , is not capable of her worth : She receiveth Mammon , as a gift from his Maker , and makes him serve her use to his Glory : She gives Honour , Grace in Bounty , and , manageth wit , by the Care of discretion : She shows the Necessity of difference , and , wherein is the happiness of Unity : She puts her Labour , to providence , her hope , to patience , her life , to her Love , and her Love , to her Lord : with whom , as chief Secretary of his secrets , she writes his will to the World , and as high Steward of his Courts , she keeps Account of all his Tenants : in Sum , so great is her Grace in the Heavens , as gives her Glory above the Earth , and so , Infinite , are her Excellencies , in all the Course of her Action , and , so Glorious are the Notes of her Incomprehensible Nature , that , I will thus only Conclude , far short of her Commendation : She is God's Love , and his Angel's Light , his Servants , Grace , and His Beloved's Glory . 

Learning . 

Learning is the life of Reason , and the Light of Nature , where , Time , Order , and Measure , square out the true Course of Knowledge ; where , Discretion , in the Temper of Passion , brings experience to the best fruit of Affection : while , both , the Theoric , and the Practice , labour in the life of judgement , till , the perfection of Art , show the Honour of understanding : She is the key of knowledge , that unlocketh the Cabinet of Conceit , wherein are laid up the Labours of Virtue , for the use of the Scholars of Wisdom : where every gracious Spirit may find matter enough worthy of the Record of the best Memory : She is the Nurse of Nature , with that Milk of Reason , that , would make a Child of Grace , never lie from the Dug : She is the Schoolmistress of Wit , and the gentle Governor of Will , when , the Delight of understanding , gives the Comfort of Study : She is unpleasing to none that knows her , and unprofitable , to none that loves her : She fears not to Wet her feet , to Wade through the Waters of Comfort , but , comes not near the Seas of Iniquity , where , folly drowns Affection , in the delight of Vanity : She opens her Treasures to the Travellers in Virtue , but , keeps them close from the Eyes of Idleness : She makes the King Gracious , and his Council , judicious , his Clergy , Devout , and , his Kingdom , prosperous : She gives Honour to Virtue , Grace , to Honour , Reward , to Labour , and , Love , to Truth : She is the Messenger of Wisdom , to the minds of the Virtuous , and , the Way to Honour , in the Spirits of the Gracious : She is the Storehouse of Understanding , where the Affection of Grace , can not want Instruction of goodness , while , in the Rules of her directions , Reason is never out of square : She is the Exercise of Wit , in the application of Knowledge , and the preserver of the understanding , in the practice of Memory : In brief , she makes Age honourable , and , youth Admirable : the virtuous , wise , and the wise , gracious : Her Libraries are infinite , her lessons without number , her instruction , without comparison , and her Scholars without equality : In brief , finding it a labyrinth , to go through the grounds of her praise : Let this suffice , that in all Ages she hath been , and ever will be , the Darling of wisdom , the delight of wit , the study of virtue , and the stay of knowledge . 

Knowledge . 

Knowledge is a Collection of understanding , gathered in the grounds of Learning , by the instruction of Wisdom : She is the exercise of Memory , in the actions of the Mind , and the imployer of the Senses , in the will of the Spirit : she is the Notary of Time , and the tryer of Truth , and the labour of the Spirit in the love of Virtue : she is the pleasure of wit , and the paradise of Reason , where Conceit gathereth the sweet of Understanding . She is the King's councillor , & the Counsels grace , Youth's guard , and Ages glory : It is free from doubts , and fears no danger , while the care of Providence cuts off the cause of Repentance : she is the enemy of Idleness , and the maintainer of Labour , in the care of credit , and pleasure of profit : she needs no advice in the Resolution of Action , while Experience in observation , finds perfection infallible : It clears Errors , and cannot be deceived , corrects Impurity , and will not be corrupted : She hath a wide ear , and a close mouth , a pure eye , and a perfect heart : It is begotten by Grace , bred by Virtue , brought up by Learning , and maintained by Love : she converseth with the best capacities , and communicates with the soundest judgements , dwells with the divinest Natures , and loves the most patient dispositions : Her hope is a kind of Assurance , her faith a continual expectation , her love an apprehension of joy , and her life the light of Eternity : Her labours are infinite , her ways are unsearchable , her Grace's incomparable , and her Excellencies inexplicable : and therefore , being so little acquainted with her worth , as makes me blush at my unworthiness , to speak in the least of her praise : I will only leave her advancement to Virtue , her honour to Wisdom , her grace to Truth , and to Eternity ; his glory . 

Practice . 

Practice , is the Motion of the Spirit , where the Senses are all set to work in their Natures , where , in the fittest employment of Time , Reason maketh the best use of understanding : She is the Continuance of knowledge in the Ease of Memory , and , the Honour of Resolution in the effect of judgement . She plants the Spring , and reaps the Harvest , makes labour sweet , and patience , comfortable : She hath a foot on the earth , but , an eye at heaven , where the prayer of faith finds the felicity of the Soul : in the fruit of Charity , she shows the nature of Devotion , and in the Mercy of justice , the Glory of government . She gives Time honour , in the fruit of Action , and Reason , grace , in the application of knowledge : She takes the height of the Sun , walks about the world , sounds the depth of the Sea , and makes her passage through the waters . She is ready for all occasions , attendeth all persons , works with all instruments , and finisheth all actions : She takes Invention for her teacher , makes time , her servant , method her direction , and place her habitation : She hath a wakeful eye , and a working brain , which fits the members of the body , to the service of the spirit : She is the Physician's agent , and the Apothecary's benefactor , the Surgeon's wealth , and the Patients , patience : She brings time , to labour , and care , to contentment : learning to knowledge , and virtue to honour : in Idleness she hath no pleasure , nor acquaintance with Ignorance , but in Industry , is her delight , and in understanding , her grace : She hath a passage through all the Predicaments , she hath a hand in all the Arts , a property in all professions , and a quality in all conditions : in brief , so many are the varieties of the manners of her proceedings , as makes me fearful to follow her too far in observation , lest , being never able to come near the height of her commendation , I be enforced , as I am , to leave her wholly to admiration . 

Patience . 

Patience is a kind of heavenly Tenure , whereby the Soul is held in possession , and a sweet temper in the Spirit , which restraineth nature from exceeding reason in passion . Her hand keeps time in his right course , and her eye pierceth into the depth of understanding : She attendeth wisdom in all her works , and proportioneth time , to the necessity of matter : She is the poison of Sorrow in the hope of Comfort , and the paradise of conceit in the joy of peace : Her tongue speaks seldom , but to purpose , and her foot goeth slowly , but surely : She is the imitator of the Incomprehensible in his passage to perfection , and a servant of his will in the map of his workmanship : in Confusion , She hath no operation , while she only ●arieth her conceit , with the consideration of experience : She travails far , and is never weary ; and gives over no work , but to better a beginning : She makes the King merciful , and the Subject loyal , Honour gracious , and , Wisdom glorious : She pacifieth wrath , and puts off revenge , and , in the humility of charity , shows the nature of Grace : She is beloved of the Highest , and embraced of the wisest , honoured with the worthiest , and graced with the best : She makes imprisonment , Liberty , when the mind goeth through the world , and in sickness finds health , where death is the way to life : She is an Enemy to passion , and knows no Purgatory ; thinks fortune a fiction , and builds only upon Providence : She is the sick-man's Salve , and the whole man's preserver : the Wiseman's staff , and the goodman's Guide : In sum , not to wade too far in her worthiness , lest I be drowned in the depth of wonder , I will thus end , in her endless Honour : She is the grace of Christ , and the virtue of Christianity , the praise of Goodness , and the preserver of the world . 

Love.  

Love is the life of Nature , and the joy of Reason , in the Spirit of Grace ; where virtue drawing affection , the concord of Sense , makes an union unseparable in the divine apprehension of the joy of Election , it is a ravishment of the Soul , in the delight of the Spirit : which , being carried above itself , into inexplicable comfort , feels that heavenly sickness , that is better than the world's health , when the wisest of men , in the swooning delight of his sacred Inspiration , could thus utter the sweetness of his passion : My Soul is sick of Love. It is a healthful sickness in the Soul , a pleasing passion in the Heart , a contentive labour in the Mind , and a peaceful trouble of the Senses : it altars natures in contrarieties , when difficulty is made easy , pain , made a pleasure , poverty , riches , and imprisonment , liberty : for the content of conceit , which regards not to be an abject , in being subject , but to an object : it rejoiceth in truth , and knows no inconstancy , it is free from jealousy , and feareth no fortune : it breaks the rule of Arithmericke , by confounding of number , where the conjunction of thoughts make one mind in two bodies , where neither figure , nor cipher , can make division of union : it sympathies with life , and participates with light , when the eye of the mind , sees the joy of the heart : it is a predominat power , which endures no equality , and yet , communicates with reason , in the rules of Concord : it breeds safety in a King , and peace , in a kingdom , Nation's unity , and Nature's gladness : It sings in labour , in the joy of hope , and makes a paradise in reward of desert : it pleads but mercy , in the justice of the Almighty ; and but mutual Amity , in the nature of Humanity : In sum , having no Eagles eye , to look upon the Sun , and fearing to look too high , for fear of a chip in mine eye , I will in these few words , speak in praise of this peerless virtue : Love is the grace of nature , and the glory of reason , the blessing of God , and the comfort of the world . 

Peace . 

PEACE , is a Calm in Conceit , where the Senses take pleasure , in the rest of the Spirit : It is Nature's holy day after Reason's labour , and Wisdoms music in the Concord's of the mind : It is a blessing of Grace , a bounty of Mercy , a proof of Love , and , a preserver of life : It holds no Arguments , knows no quarrels , is an enemy to sedition , and a continuance of Amity : It is the root of plenty , the Tree of pleasure , the fruit of Love , and the sweetness of life : It is like the still Night , where all things are at rest , and the quiet sleep , where dreams are not troublesome : or the resolved point , in the perfection of knowledge , where no cares , nor doubts make controversies in opinion : it needs no watch , where is no fear of Enemy , nor Solicitor of Causes , where Agreements are concluded : It is the intent of Law , and the fruit of justice : the end of War , and the beginning of Wealth : It is a grace in a Court , and a glory in a Kingdom , a blessing in a Family , and a happiness in a Commonwealth : It fills the rich man's coffers , and feeds the poor man's labour : It is the Wiseman's study , and the Goodman's joy : who love it , are gracious , who make it , are blessed , who keep it are happy , and who break it , are miserable : It hath no dwelling with Idolatry , nor friendship with falsehood , for her life is in Truth , and in her , all is Amen . But lest in the justice of Peace , I may rather be reproved for my Ignorance of her worth , then thought worthy to speak in her praise , with this only Conclusion , in the commendation of Peace , I will draw to an end , and hold my peace : It was a message of joy at the birth of Christ , a song of joy , at the embracement of Christ , an assurance of joy , at the death of Christ , and shall be the fullness of joy , at the coming of Christ.  

War . 

WAR is a scourge of the wrath of God , which by famine , fire , or sword , humbleth the spirits of the Repentant , trieth the patience of the Faithful , and hardeneth the hearts of the ungodly : it is the misery of Time , and the terror of Nature , the dispeopling of the Earth , and the ruin of her Beauty : Her life , is Action , her food ; Blood , her honour , Valour , and her joy , Conquest . She is Valour's exercise , and Honour's adventure , Reason's trouble , and Peace's enemy : she is the stout man's love , and the weak man's fear , the poor man's toil , and the rich man's plague : she is the Armourers Benefactor , and the Surgeon's agent , the Coward's ague , and the Desperats overthrow : she is the wish of Envy , the plague of them that wish her , the shipwreck of life , and the agent for death ; The best of her is , that she is the seasoner of the body , and the manager of the mind , for the enduring of labour , in the resolution of action : she thunders in the Air , rips up the Earth , cuts through the Seas , and consumes with the fire : she is indeed the invention of Malice , the work of Mischief , the music of Hell , and the dance of the Devil : she makes the end of Youth untimely , and of Age wretched , the City's sack , and the Country's beggary : she is the Captain's pride , and the Captives sorrow , the throat of blood , and the grave of flesh : she is the woe of the world , the punishment of sin , the passage of danger , and , the Messenger of destruction : she is the wise man's warning , and the fool's payment , the godly man's grief , and , the wicked man's game : In sum , so many are her wounds , so mortal her cures , so dangerous her course , and , so devilish her devices , that , I will wade no further in her rivers of blood , but , only , thus conclude in her description : she is God's curse , and Man's misery , hell's Practice , and earth's Hell.  

Valour . 

Valour is a Virtue in the spirit , which keeps the flesh in subjection : Resolves without fear , and travails without fainting : she vows no villainy , nor , breaks ; her fidelity , she is patient in captivity , and pitiful in conquest : Her gain is honour , and , desert her mean , fortune her scorn , and folly , her hate : wisdom is her guide , and conquest her grace , clemency , her praise , and humility , her Glory : she is youth's ornament , and ages honour ; natures blessing , and Virtue ; love : Her life is resolution , & her love , victory , her triumph , truth , and her fame , virtue : Her arms are from antiquity , and , her cote , full of honour , where , the title of grace , hath her Heraldry from heaven she makes a walk of war , and a sport of danger , an ease , of labour , and a lest , of death : she makes famine , but abstinence , want , but , a patience , sickness , but a purge , and death , a puff : she is the Maintainer of ●arre , the General of an army , ●he terror of an Enemy , and the ●ory of a camp : she is the Nobleness of the mind , and the strength of the Body , the li●e of ●ope , and the death of fear ▪ with 〈◊〉 handful of men , she overthrows a multitude , and with a ●daine amazement , she discom●tes a Camp : she is the revenge ●f wrong , and the defence of ●ight , Religion's Champion , and , ●ertues' choice : In brief , let this suffice in her commendation : she ●rengthened David , and conquered Goliath , she overthrows her enemy's , and conquers herself . 

Resolution . 

Resolution is the Honoure● Valour , in the quarrel of Virtue , for the defence of Right , an● Redress of Wrong : She , beate● the March , pitcheth the Battle plants the Ordinance , and Maintains the fight : Her Ear is stop● from Dissuasions , her Eye aim●● only at Honour , her hand takes the Sword of Valour , and her heart thinks of nothing , but victory● She gives the Charge , makes the Stand , Assaults the fort , and enters the Breach : She breaks the Pikes , faceth the Shot , damps the Soldier , and defeats the Army : She loses no time , slips no Occasion , dreads no danger , and , Cares for no force ; ●he is Valour's life , and virtues ●ove , justice Honour , and , Mer●ies Glory : She beats down Castles , fires Ships , Wades through the Sea , and Walks through the World : She makes wisdom , her Guide , and Will , ●er Servant , Reason , her Companion , and Honour , her Mistress : ●he is a Blessing in Nature , and a beauty , in Reason , a Grace in In●ention , and , a Glory in Action : ●he studies no plots , when her platform is set down , and defers ●o time , when her hour is pre●xed : She stands upon no helps , when she knows her own ●orce , and in the Execution of her ●ill , she is a Rock Irremoveable : ●he is the Kings Will , without Contradiction , and the judge's ●oome , without Exception , the scholars profession , without Alteration , and the Soldier's Honour without Comparison : In Summ● so many are the grounds of he● Grace , and the just Causes of he● Commendation , that , Leavin● her worth , to the description 〈◊〉 better wits , I will in these few words , conclude my Conceit● her . She is the stoutness of th● heart , and the strength of th● mind , a gift of God , and , th● glory of the World.  

Honor.  

Honour is a Title of Grace given by the spirit of Virtue , to the desert of Valour , in th● defence of Truth : it is wronged in baseness , and abused in un●worthinesse , endangered in wantonness , and lost in wickedness It nourisheth Art , and crownet● Wit , graceth Learning , and glorifieth Wisdom : in the Heraldry of Heaven , it hath the richest Coat , being , in Nature Allied , unto all the houses of Grace , which in the Heaven of heavens , attend the King of kings : Her Escutcheon is a heart , in which , in the shield of faith , she bears on the Anchor of Hope , the Helmit of Salvation : she quarter's with Wisdom in the Resolution of Valour , and in the line of Charity , she is of the House of justice : Her Supporters are Time , and Patience , her Mantle , Truth , and her crest , Christ treading upon the Globe of the world : her Impreze , Corona mea , Christus : In brief , finding her state so high , that I am not able to climb unto the praise of her perfection , I will leave her Royalty to the Register of most Princely spirits , and in my humble hearts thus only deliver my opinion of her : She is Virtue's due , and Grace's gift , Valour's wealth , and Reason's joy . 

Truth . 

Truth is the Glory of time , and the daughter of Eternity : a Title of the highest Grace , and , a Note of a divine Nature : she is the life of Religion , the light of Love , the Grace of Wit , and the Crown of Wisdom , she is the Beauty of Valour , the brightness of honour , the blessing of reason , and the joy of faith : her truth is pure gold , her Time , is right precious , her word is most gracious , and her will , is most glorious : Her Essence is in God , and , her dwelling with his servants , her will in his wisdom , and her work , to his Glory : she is honoured in love , and graced in constancy , in patience admired , and in charity , beloved she is the Angel's worship , the Virgin's fame , the Saints bliss , and the Martyr's crown : she is the King's Greatness , and his Counsels , Goodness , his subject's Peace , and his kingdom's Praise : she is the life of learning , and the light of the Law , the honour of Trade , and the grace of labour : she hath a pure Eye , a plain hand , a piercing wit and a perfect heart : she is wisdom's walk in the way of holiness , and takes up her rest , but , in the resolution of goodness : Her tongue never trips , her heart never faints , her hand never fails , and her faith , never fears : her Church is without schism , her City without fraud , her Court , without Vanity , and her kingdom , without Villainy : In sum , so infinite is her Excellence , in the construction of all sense , that I will thus only conclude in the wonder of her worth : she is the Nature of perfection , in the perfection of Nature , where God , in Christ , shows the glory of Christianity . 

Time.  

Time is a continual Motion , which from the highest Mover , hath his operation in all the subjects of Nature , according to their quality , or disposition : He is in proportion , like a Circle , wherein , he walketh with an even passage , to the point of his prefixed place : He attendeth none , and yet is a servant to all ; he is best employed by wisdom , and , most abused , by folly : He carrieth both the sword and the sceptre , for the use both of justice , and Mercy : He is present in all Invention , and , can not be spared from Action : He is the Treasury of Graces in the Memory of the wise , and , brings them forth to the world , upon Necessity of their use : He openeth the windows of Heaven , to give Light unto the Earth , and , spreads the cloak of the Night to cover the Rest of labour : He closeth the Eye of Nature , and waketh the spirit of Reason , he traveleth through the mind , and is visible , but , to the Eye of Understanding : He is swifter than the wind , and yet , as still , as a Stone , precious in his right use , but , perilous in the contrary : He is soon found of the careful Soul , and quickly missed in the want of his comfort , he is soon lost in the lack of Employment , and not to be recovered without a world of Endeavour : he is the true man's peace , and the Thief's perdition , the good man's blessing , and the wicked man's curse : He is known to be , but , his being unknown , but only in his being , in a being above knowledge : he is a Riddle not to be read , but in the circumstance of description , his name , better known then his nature , and he that maketh best use of him , hath the best understanding so him : he is like the study of the Philosopher's stone , where , a man may see wonders , and yet short of his Expectation : she is at the Invention of war , Arms the Soldier , Maintains the quarrel , and makes the Peace : He is the Courtier's Playfellow , and , the Soldier's Schoolmaster , the Lawyer's Gain , and the Merchants , Hope : His life , is Motion , and his love Action , his honour , Patience , and his glory , perfection : He masketh Modesty and blusheth Virginity , honoureth Humility , and graceth , Charity : In Sum , finding it a world to walk through the wonder of his Worth , I will thus briefly deliver , what I find truly of him : He is the Agent of the Living , and the Register of the dead , the direction of God , and a great Workemaster in the world . 

Death . 

DEATH is an ordinance of God , for the subiecting of the world , which is limited his time for the correction of Pride ; in his substance , he is nothing , being but only a deprivation , and in his true description , a name without a nature : He is seen , but in a picture : heard , but in a tale : feared , but in a passion : and felt , but in a pinch : He is a terror , but to the wicked , and a scarecrow , but to the foolish : but to the wise , a way of comfort , and to the godly , the gate of life : He is the case of pain , and the end of sorrow , the liberty of the imprisoned , and the joy of the faithful : it is both the wound of sin , and the wages of sin , the Sinners fear , and the Sinners doom . He is the Sexton's agent , and the Hangman's revenue , the rich man's dirge , and the Mourners merry-day . He is a course of time , but uncertain , till he come , and welcome but to such , as are weary of their lives : It is a message from the Physician , when the Patient is past cure , and if the writ be well made , it is a supra sedeas for all diseases : It is the heaven's stroke , and the earth's Steward , the follower of sickness , and the forerunner to Hell. In sum , having no pleasure to ponder too much of the power of it , I will thus conclude my opinion of it ▪ It is a sting of sin , and the terror of the wicked , the crown of the Godly , the stair of vengeance , and a stratagem of the Devil . 

Faith.  

FAITH is the hand of the soul , which layeth hold of the promises of Christ in the mercy of the Almighty : She hath a bright eye , and a holy ear , a clear heart , and a sure foot : she is the strength of Hope , the trust of Truth , the honour of Amity , and the joy of Love : she is rare among the sons of men , and hardly found among the daughters of women ; but among the sons of God , she is a conveyance of their inheritance , and among the daughters of Grace , she is the assurance of their portions . Her dwelling is in the Church of God , her conversation with the Saints of God , her delight with the beloved of God , and her life is in the love of God : she knows no falsehood , distrusts no Truth , breaks no promise , and coins no excuse , but as bright as the Sun , as swift as the wind , as sure as the rock , and as pure as the gold , she looks towards heaven , but lives in the world , in the souls of the Elect , to the glory of Election : she was wounded in Paradise , by a dart of the Devil , and healed of her hurt , by the death of Christ jesus : she is the poor man's credit , and the rich man's praise , the wiseman's care , and the good man's cognizance . In sum , finding her worth , in words hardly to be expressed , I will in these few words only deliver my opinion of her : She is God's blessing , and man's bliss , reason's comfort , and virtue's glory . 

Fear . 

FEAR is a fruit of sin , which drove the first Father of our flesh , from the presence of God , and hath bred an imperfection in a number of the worse part of his posterity : It is the disgrace of nature , the foil of reason , the maim of wit , and the slur of understanding : It is the palsy of the Spirit , where the Soul wanteth faith , and the badge of a Coward , that cannot abide the sight of a sword : It is weakness in nature , and a wound in patience , the death of hope , and the entrance into despair : It is children's awe , and fool's amazement , a worm in conscience , and a curse to wickedness . In brief , it makes the Coward stagger , the Liar stammer , the Thief stumble , and the Traitor start : It is a blot in Arms , a blur in Honour , the shame of a Soldier , and the defeat of an Army .
