An exhortation to families , who have desires to serve the Lord God in their several places , that they May all learn in the light of Christ Jesus , the wisdom and power of God , who is the true teacher . 

Oh ye fathers , and mothers , stand in the pure fear of the Lord , and wait in his light , that ye May receive his living wisdom , and live in it , that so ye May be ordered by it , and with it order all things to God's glory , and bring up your children in the fear of the Lord , watching over them in the seasoned savoury life of God , not suffering them to live to wildness , nor idleness , nor vain talking ( Unreproved ; ) but in the sober , meek spirit , and in the authority of God's lamb , reprove them , and that will reach the witness of God in them , and correct them in the fear , and wisdom , and freedom of God , in the patience , and follow not their foolish wills , neither correct them in your own wills , nor in hastiness , rashness , or passion ; for if ye do , then that will use the rod , which is to be beaten with the rod of God , and that will make your children more stubborn and wicked , and this will offend God ; but stand ye in God's counsel , and discourage nothing in your children , but evil , and let them have that which is meet , just and reasonable , and no more , that none of God's creatures be wasted ; and be ye patterns and good examples ( In all holiness , gravity and uprightness ) unto them , and let them have sufficient liberty to go to godly meetings , and rather stir them up and encourage them to go to such , then hinder or discourage them , and keep your minds out of them unto the Lord , and let your love to them be in the Lord , that so ye May feel his blessing coming upon you , and them . 

And all ye children who have parents , honour ( And be obedient unto ) them , in the Lord , and mind the light of Christ ( In you ) and that will not suffer ye to be wild , nor wilful , stubborn , nor vain , but it will check and reprove ye for all evil , and if ye will own its reproof , and believe and wait in it , it will lead ye out of all evil , and it will bring ye into soberness and meekness , tenderness and innocency , and preserve ye in it , and it will bring ye to know and remember your creator in the days of your youth , and it will reveal God's power and wisdom in ye , whereby ye will be kept in true order : so suffer not your minds to follow vanity , neither walk in stubbornness towards your parents , ( Nor others ; ) i warn ye in God's fear , lest he shorten your days , and cut ye off by his righteous judgements ; but mind his fear , and wait therein , that ye May feel his grace , and be taught by it , and be obedient unto it , and then ye will feel the mercy and blessing of the Lord . 

And all ye that are Masters and Dames , wait in the true light , that ye May feel Christ the power and wisdom of God , to be your Master , that so ye May rule in your places , in his fear and wisdom ; and lay no more upon your servants then ye would be willing should be laid upon you , if ye were in their places and conditions : ( Mark that ) and forbear threatening them , and be not hasty to turn them away , if they be willing to abide with you , but in patience and meekness show them their place and service , and therein teach them , if they know it not , and let them have for their service that which is convenient , just and reasonable , that they May have no just cause to murmur or complain ; and keep out of covetousness , lest that hinder you from giving them sufficient liberty ( Who desires it ) for going to the meetings of the persons of the Lord ; and if in the wisdom of God ye see freedom to turn any away , give them sufficient warning , that they May provide themselves other ways , for this is but just and reasonable ; and be not hasty nor rash with them , nor run into jangling with them , but if ye have cause to reprove them , let it be in the fear and wisdom of God , in the freedom and authority of the truth , and that will reach unto the witness of God in them ; so be not high-minded , but fear , and be patterns unto them in the lowly , meek and quiet spirit ; and bear with the weak , and forgive them that trespass against you , and render not evil for evil to any , but overcome evil with that which is good , and live in that which overcomes evil , that so the truth of God May be exalted over all . 

And all ye that are servants , live in the fear of the Lord , and wait in his light , and be obedient thereunto , and also be obedient ( In your places ) unto those that are your Masters and Dames ( According to the flesh ) not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward , serving them in faithfulness and uprightness of heart , doing what ye do for them , as diligently , faithfully and willingly , as ye should do any thing to the Lord , for this is right in the sight of God ; and take heed that none of God's creatures be lost , or wasted under your hands , through your neglecting them , or slothfulness in your places ; and do not falsely accuse any , or speak evil behind any ones back , thereby thinking to get the favour or love of any , or upon any other account , for that is evil ; and be as diligent in your places , when your Masters or Dames are absent , as when they are present , for this is just and right ; and be not stubborn nor wilful , neither use many words to your Masters or Dames , and if ye know not well how to perform your service aright , then in true humility be willing to learn , and take heed of high-mindedness and pride , or of being wise in your own eyes ; and when you have any spare time allowed ye , ( Being free from outward employment ) see that ye spend it in the fear of the Lord , in waiting upon him in his light , that so all vain talking , corrupt communication , foolish jesting , and all vanity May be kept out of ; and give ye not way to that mind which is unstable , which would be oft shifting , and going from place to place , for this is not right in the sight of God , but wait in the light , that ye May be stayed , and settled in your minds ; and if ye see freedom in the fear of God ( Mark that ) to go to another place , then give your Masters or Dames sufficient notice of it ; and if any of you , who know the truth , come to be moved of the Lord to go to any place his service , be faithful to the Lord , and when your service which he required of you is done , then return to your places again ( Except it be otherways ordered in the fear and wisdom of God ) and be diligent in your places , doing the same that ye would others should do unto you in the like condition ; and mind the Lord in all things , and above all things , and be faithful unto him , and he will be your reward . 

And all ye fathers , and mothers , and children , and Masters , and Dames , and servants , who have the creatures of God to buy or sell , or to exchange , live in the fear of the Lord , that ye May feel his wisdom to guide you in your trading , and do not speak better or worse of the creatures than you know them to be , thereby to get the greater gain , for that is idolatry , it arising from covetousness ; but wait to feel God's spirit to bridle your tongues , and use but few words in your trading ; and if ye ask a question therein , do it in simplicity , and keep in the light which is equal , that when ye offer or ask a price for the creatures , it May be in equality , and let that be your rule , and not the price of the market , except that be equal , that so ye May reach the equal principle one in another ; and than stand to your word , and here your yea will be yea , and your nay will be nay , and so ye will be kept in the doctrine of Christ , with his light , out of all evil ; and ye abiding in the light , it will bring ye to do to every one , as ye would be done unto ; and take heed that ye stir not up the impatient crooked disorderly nature , one in another , with your words or actions ; but bear one with another , and forgive one another , and when ye tell each other of a fault , do it in the fear , and wisdom , and meek spirit of God's lamb , that so ye May restore each other therein ; and when ye have any convenient time , assemble yourselves together in the name and fear of the Lord , and wait every particular in the measure and gift of God in you , which is given ye to profit withal ; and all wait together in the light , and believe in it , that ye May be children of the light , and therein watch unto prayer , and one over another , and this will beget ye into unfeigned love , and walking in the light ye will have true unity , and fellowship one with another ; and the blood ( Which is the life ) of Jesus Christ you will feel cleansing you from all sin , and so ye will come into the unity with God . Also , to feel his word , his power , and wisdom ( In you ) by which all things were create and made , and are upheld , that therein ye May be ordered in the particular , and that therein ye May use and order all God's creatures , to his glory ; and than all false weights , and measures , and ways , and worships will be destroyed , and then shall truth , equity , righteousness , and true order and mercy prosper , and run down as a river : so let your faith stand in Christ Jesus the light , and wisdom , and power of God , and then true worship , true weight , true measure shall be set up and established , and then shall the Lord be exalted over all the works of his hands , and so ye will feel his blessing ; unto him belongeth the dominion and honour , for he is worthy of it for evermore , amen .
