Good counsel and advice , rejected ; by disobedient men . 

And the days of Oliver Cromwell's visitation passed over ; and also of Richard Cromwell his son , late protectors of these nations . 

And the many precious warnings neglected by them , and set at naught , which from time to time the servants of the Lord gave unto them , as declared in these following letters ; whereby all May see the kindness of the Lord towards them , by his faithful invitations to them , and their own apostasy and carelessness , who rejected warning 〈◊〉 the time and day of their visitation is shut up with the vale of darkness and reproach , which lies over them , and their precious day of love is spent , and cannot be recalled . 

〈◊〉 to 〈◊〉 view , by one that wished well to them in their day , and is a friend unto all that love righteousness , and hates oppression .

To the reader . 

Friend , out of the same love from whence these were written , do i put them to public view , and it was not without much doubtings and questioning in my own spirit , but at last having found perfect freedom and strength from the Lord , knowing that i am clear and free altogether of other ends , saving then for the honour of the truth , and that all May see that the downfalls of these men were not before sufficient warnings , which makes the Lord free , and his servants free from what is come to pass upon them , and even their fall lies upon their own heads that despised the Lords warnings , and would none of his counsel , but suffered the innocent to be oppressed under their power , and relieved not the heritage of the Lord from her cruel enemies , though they had power to do it , but sought their own glory , and how to be established in greatness in the earth , till that the Lord hath cast them out , and made them as a reproach . And these things that have come to pass upon them , May be as warnings to all other rulers that doth succeed them , and they May know that the Lord is just and his judgements righteous , and whosoever shall follow their steps , and be oppressors of the Lord's heritage , as they were , the Lord shall extend his judgments unto them also , and their destruction shall come , even like as upon these before them ; therefore let all the earth be warned . 

I am a lover of Zion .

Friend , 

Many warnings hast thou had from the mouth of the Lord , his love hath been towards thee , and the glorious day of his visitation hath shined over thy head , wherein he hath called unto thee to hear and obey his voice , and would have instructed thee in the way that thou shouldst walk , that thy soul Might live for ever in peace and rest , when this world is passed away ; and that in this present world he Might have made thee a blessing to thyself and posterity and persons , and a praise in thy dominions , and unto ages after thee , if thou hadst harkened and obeyed his voice , and chosen his way and counsel , and not thine own ; and then would he have made thine enemies to have bowed under thee , and the force of their policy and arm should never have prevailed against thee , and thou shalt be delivered from the will of all that hate thee , if thou yet will hearken unto him , and receive his instruction , and set thy heart to seek his honour more than thine own , and will let his counsel be thy guide & ruler , & not vain man , which must be brought to naught ; even now , before the day of thy visitation besprent , never more to be recalled , and the time come when God will cease to strive with thee , & will not call unto thee , but will leave thee to thy own hearts false judgement , and the counsels of treacherous men ; and friend i as one that hath obtained mercy from the Lord , unto whom his word is committed , being moved of him , do hereby in his presence yet once more warn thee , that thou fear before him , and diligently hearken to him , and seek him with all thy heart , that thou Mayst know his will and counsel concerning thee , and May do it , and find favour in his sight , and live ; and now is the day that his hand is stretched forth unto thee , to make thee a blessing , or to leave thee a curse for ever ; and the days of thy visitation is near an end , when God will no more call unto thee , nor hear thee , when in the day of thy trouble thou calls to him , neither will answer thee by vision nor dream , nor prophet , but will leave thee to the counsels of treacherous men , who will seek after thy life , and wait for thy overthrow , and watch for evil against thee , that they May glory in thy desolation ; and such there is , of whom thou hast need to beware ; and if thou reject the counsel of the Lord , and follow the desires of thine own heart , and the wills of men , and will not have the light of the world , Christ Jesus only , to rule thee and to teach thee , which condemns all evil , then shall evil surely fall upon thee , if thou lovest not the light in thee , which condemns it , and the judgements of God , nor the day of his last visitation with vengeance , thou Mayest not escape ; therefore consider , and mark my words , and let this counsel be acceptable unto thee , that thy days May be many , and blessed upon earth ; and first consider , and let it move upon thee to meekness , to humbleness and to fear before the Lord , assuredly knowing , that it is he that changeth times and things , and that bringeth down and setteth up whomsoever he will ; and how that thou was raised from a low estate , and set over all , thine enemies , and thy horn was exalted above them all and he gave thee the necks of Princes to tread upon , and more honourable ; and their dominions to inherit , and thou was set a ruler in much dominion , and had favour in his sight , and in the sight of many persons who wished well unto thee for a blessing ; many victories honourable and remarkable was given unto thee , over them who had exalted themselves against God ; and ruled in tyranny over his persons ; whom the Lord pitied , and thou an instrument in his hand , was ordained by him , to lead forth a persons , whom he blessed with thee , against a cruel persons , and generation of oppressors , who exercised tyranny over the Lord's heritage , till they were taken away and cast out , and is a reproach unto the Lord and his persons unto this day ; and even so shall all be that follows their example and are oppressors and tyrants over the seed of God ; as they were ; and this thou knowest , that not by might , nor multitude , but by the arm of the Lord , were they subdued and made a prey unto thee , and their treasures a spoil unto thy hands ; and so it was , that thou Mightest have glorified him for ever ; and exalted him in the great congregation , and gone on in faithfulness to the end , and in that day when thou was raised up , when the fear of the Lord was before thy face , and thy heart was towards him ; and thou was but little in thine own eyes , than was it well with thee , and the Lord blessed thee , and made thee honourable , and his persons had love towards thee , and desires for thee , that thou Might have been as a helper to the poor and a father to the faithful , and a preserver of the upright from unreasonable men , and an easer of the oppressed , & a taker away of every oppressive bond ; and it was not once thought concerning thee , that the hands of the ungodly would have been strengthened against the righteous under thee ; or that such grievous and cruel burdens and oppressions would ever have been laid upon the just , and acted against them , in thy name , and under thy dominion , as unrighteously have come to pass in these three years , as a large testimony Might be given ; and this thy suffering of such things is thy transgression , and thou hast not requited the Lord well for his goodness unto thee ; nor fulfilled his will in suffering that to be done under thee , and in thy name , which the Lord raised thee against to break down , hadst thou been faithful to the end . Again consider and let it move on thy heart not to exalt thyself , nor to be high minded , but to fear continally , knowing that thou standest not by thyself but by another , and that he is able to abase thee , and give thee into the will of thy enemies ; when soever he will , and how the Lord hath preserved thee sometimes wonderfully , and doth unto this day , from the murderous plots and crafty policy of evil men , who seeks thy evil , and would rejoice in thy fall , and in the desolation of thy family and countries ; how have they and do they lay snares for thy feet , that thou May be cut off from amongst men , and die unhappily , and be accounted a curse ; and yet to this day he hath preserved thee and been near thee to keep thee , though thou hast hardly known it ; and the Lord's end is love to thee in all these things , and yet a little longer to try thee , and that thou Might give him the glory ; oh that thy heart were opened to see his hand , that thou Mayst live unto him , and die in him in peace ; and beware least hardness of heart possess thee ; if thou slight his love , and so be shut up in darkness , and given to the desires of thine enemies , and left to the counsels of treacherous men , who May seek to exalt thee by flattery that they Might the better cast thee down , and destroy thee , and blot out thy name in reproach , and make thy posterity a persons miserable ; but now oh consider and let it enter into thy heart , for thou hast not answered the Lord , but been wanting to him for all this ; and hast chosen thy own way and glory rather than his , and not fulfilled his counsel in raising thee , for the bonds of cruelty are not loosed by thee , and the oppressed is not altogether set free , neither is oppression taken off from the back of the poor , nor the laws regulated , nor liberty of pure conscience altogether allowed ; but these dominions are filled with cruel oppressors , and the poor groans everywhere under their heavy hand of injustice , the needy are trodden down under foot , and the oppressed cries for deliverance , and are ready to faint for true justice , and judgement ; the proud exalts himself against the poor , and the high minded and rebellious contemns the meek of the earth ; the horn of the ungodly is exalted over the Lord's heritage , and they that are departed from iniquity are become a prey to oppressors , and the cruel hearted deals cruelly with the innocent in these nations ; and such whom the Lord hath freed in their consciences from false worships and teachers , and from the ways of sin and death , are made slaves , and greedily preyed upon by unjust men , through casting into prisons , and dungeons , and unjust fines , and illegal proceedings , and beatings and abusings , and woundings and bruisings , hard to be expressed and large to be declared ; even the hands of many of the persons over whom thou art set to rule , are full of blood , merciless and cruel ; and neither fears God , nor are subject to the just rule and government of men ; and the mouth of many of thy subservant rulers and governors that have their power from thee are as the teeth of young lions , and the upright and harmless , are devoured and made a spoil by them , through policy and oppression , both in their persons and estates ; if i perish i must speak the truth ; my life is not dear to me for the truth sake ; many who should have judged in true justice and righteousness the cause of the poor , have been as briars and thorns to ensnare and pierce the just man ; and have perverted judgement , and turned it backward , & equity have hardly had place to enter ; most of the prisons this day in all thy juridictions have and doth testify the unjust judgement , and the great oppressions and cruelties of some in authority who have used , or rather abused thy name , and made it a cloak for their hardheartedness ; oh my heart is troubled , and my bowels pained at the remembrance of this ; how doth the poor cry under the heavy hand of oppression , and the needy lament for want of true judgement , and the oppressed groan for want of deliverance ? and these things are thought upon by the Lord , though not considered by thee as they ought to be ; and because of this will he arise to plead the cause of the innocent against him that is too strong for him ; and will dash to pieces his enemies , and break the jaws of the devourers , and the righteous shall not always be a prey to the teeth of the ungodly . Oh friend when wilt thou consider the oppression of the poor , and hearken to the cry of the oppressed within thee , and without thee , when shall it enter into thy heart , this cause of the unjust sufferings of the Lord's persons , from which thou canst not altogether be excused ? for it is acted in thy name , though not by thee . Oh let thy ear be opened unto the cries of the oppressed in the prisons ; and let the cause of the innocent come before thee , and let thy heart be pierced at the consideration of these things which are come to pass in thy days , contrary to the expectation of many , and see if it be , not contrary to thy own promises sometimes vowed by thee ; let the light of Christ in thy own conscience answer , and some of the multitude of the grievous oppressions of which the land is full , hath been laid at thy door and brought unto thee , but scarcely found an entrance upon thee ; and this aggravates the crime of thy transgression , in that thou knowest of these things ; & wonderful is it to consider , that even thou with whom the power of the Lord hath sometimes been , should now suffer that persons with whom the power of the Lord is to be persecuted , and thy name to be a cloak for it ; how many in all parts of this nation have been and are at this day grievous sufferers under cruel bondage concerning tithes , that great abomination and idol , and cause of heavy groanings ? the bodies of many just men violently surprised , and cast into goals and prisons unjustly , and some illegally ; their cruelly suffering the loss of their liberties and the enjoyments of their families , and honest assemblies ; and others have their goods spoilt and made havoc upon , almost to the ruin of families by unreasonable men , through unjust judgement and cruel dealings of some in authority for so much unjustly , challenged by the priest or impropriator , it May be ; they distress five times so much , to the great shame of the government of a Christian nation ; as May appear in a book called the cry of the oppressed ; and how many are ready even to faint under the hard oppression of maintaining hireling teachers , and idol temples ; many for that cause also being unjust sufferers in bodies and estates , by cruel imprisonment and spoiling of goods ; the very cry of this oppression reaches unto heaven against thee , who suffers it , and against the idol shepherds who are the ground of it , who makes a prey upon God's heritage ; and the Lord God will be avenged upon them , and they and their staff shall utterly perish ; woe unto them , and to the idol worships of which the land is full , which they uphold , which causes the hearts of the righteous to mourn , because of the seed of God which is in captivity under them ; again many are unjust and woeful sufferers because they cannot swear on this or that occasion , though in all causes they speak the truth , and do obey Christ's commands , even such are trodden upon by unjust fines charged upon them , and imposed oppressions ; the example of which never went before ; many parts of this land is witness of this ; and this is by the corruptness of some that bear rule under thee , who rules not for God as they ought , but turns the sword of justice , and doth unjustly thereby , and grieves the Lord , and dishonours thee ; again some suffer long and tedious imprisonments , and others cruel stripes and abuses , and danger of life many times from wicked men , for reproving sin and crying against the abomination of the times , which the scriptures also testify against , in streets or temples , or other places ; some having been sent to prison , taken on the high way , and no evil charged against them , and others committed , being taken out of peaceable meetings , and whipped and sent to prison without transgression of any law , just or unjust , wholly through the rage and envy of the devil , and such who have perverted judgement and justice , and some in prisons have suffered superaboundantly from the hands of the cruel gaolers , and their servants , by beatings and threatenings , and putting irons on them , and not suffering any of their friends to visit them with necessaries ; and some have died in the prisons , whose lives was not dear to them , whose blood will be reckoned on account against thee , one day ; and many more other ways have suffered grievous things , as banishments out of towns , and whipping and stocking , and grievous unjust abuses , and none of these for evil doing , but for good ; even because they cannot bow to the devil , but are redeemed out of the world and therefore the world hates them , and some have suffered hard cruelties because they could not respect persons and bow with hat , or knee ; and from these cruelties canst thou not altogether be excused in the sight of God ; being brought forth in thy name and under thy power ; consider friend , and be awakened to true judgement , let the Lord search thy heart , and lay these things to mind , that thou May be an instrument to remove every burden , and May at last fulfil the will of God , are they nothing to thee ; that such things should be brought forth under thee ? Oh , be awakened , be awakened , and now seek the Lord's glory and not thine own , least thou perish before the Lord and men ; nay if men would give thee * honour and high titles and princely thrones take it not , for that which would exalt and honour thee in the world , would betray thee to the world and cast thee down in the sight of the world , and this is God's word to thee ; what ? shall the whole nation be perjured men , and thou the cause of it ? and wilt thou transgress by building again that which thou hast destroyed ? then shall the Lord and his light in every conscience bear witness against thee , let it not be , but deny thyself and thou wilt find the Lord honouring thee , give heed unto my words and understand my speech , be not exalted by man least man betray thee ; the Lord give thee an understanding in this and guide thee in his council , and the rather above all things , let thy heart be stirred up in thee for the Lord , for now is he setting up the dominion of his son , which never shall have an end , and thy dominion must bow under it , and all the dominions of the earth , or else be confounded and broken to pieces , the glory of the Lord is revealing , and thine shall be veiled before it , and the glory of all flesh shall fall ; therefore strive not openly nor secretly against his way , for it shall prosper , there is no enchantment against us nor any form weapon that can prosper ; knowest thou not that the King of righteousness Might command thousands of his saints to avenge him of his adversaries , and to plead his cause against the rebellious ? all power is in his hand , yea and the authority and dominion shall be in the hands of his saints , and every one that exalts himself against them shall be brought down , not by an outward sword or might of man , but by his outstretched arm , and all crowns that are mortal shall be trodden down , by him whose crown is immortal and never fades away ; therefore be wise and learned , this is thy day , as thou dealest or sufferest to be done with the Lord's persons , so to thee it shall be done in that day , when their government shall outreach thine and be set a top of it , as thou hopes for mercy from the Lord , when his kingdom conquers thee and thine ; now deal favourably and relieve the oppressed ; boast not thyself though the Lord hath used thee in his hand , but know that when he will he can cast thee , a rod , out of his hand into the fire ; for in his hand thou art , if thou honour him he will honour thee , otherwise he can , yea , and will confound thee and break thee , and make thee weak as water before him ; his love , through my heart , breathes unto thee ; he would thy happiness if thou wilfully contemn it not , by exalting thyself and seeking thine own glory , and hardening thy heart against the cry of the poor ; and this i was moved in the bowels of pity to lay before thee , who am thy friend , not in flattery , but in an upright heart , who wisheth well unto thee in the Lord .

For the hands of Oliver Cromwell called protector . 

Friend , 

I am moved to write to thee , from the occasion of being with thee yesterday , and i take liberty from the true love and pity stired up in my heart towards thee , who am thy friend and wisheth well unto thee in the Lord , even that salvation thou Mayest receive , and that thy way May be blessed upon earth , and the fruits of the knowledge of God Might more abound in thee , and the fruits of ignorance less , which doth appear , which i wish Might be cut off before they wholly overgrow thee , and remove the blessing far from thee in this life and in the life to come , and bring upon thee destruction ; for the fruits of all unrighteousness , brings death , sorrow , and misery , and the light of Christ in thee shall answer in all things to the justness of the judgements of the Lord . Thou sayest in effect , that thou wouldst not , or thou desirest not our persecution , or that we should be persecuted by cruelty or unjust imprisonment ; now consider what the cause is , that what thou desirest not to be done , yet is done , thou having power in thy hand only to prevent what thou wouldst not have done , is it not thine own unfaithfulness to the principle of God in thee , which beareth witness against the persecution of the innocent ? or is it that thou Mayest please men and therefore rather suffers wickedness to abound , and injustice and oppression to be acted against the poor , ( Making it appear thou art willing to do the false teachers of this nation and wicked men a pleasure ) then to own the persons of God in relieving them , and easing their cruel burdens and oppressions laid upon them by unjust men , for a word of thy mouth , or the show of thy countenance in dislike of these many cruel and unjust persecutions , would bind the hands of many bloodthirsty men , and stop the mouths of many devourers ; and therefore because of thine own unfaithfulness doth that come to pass which thou desirest not ? and so i must needs say this appears to be evil in thee , to say in effect thou approvest not , or thou desirest not our persecution , and yet it is done , when the power is in thy hand to remove it , and this in much love and great pains , i declare unto thee in the fear and council of God . 

Further thou sayest , thou art not guilty of these persecutions acted unjustly upon us . 

Again consider , i say thou canst not be cleared in the sight of the Lord God from them , being acted under thee , and in thy name , in the day of the Lord the light of Christ in thee shall answer this ; for there seems to be rather a favouring of them in thee , and by forbearance of the actors of cruelty , by which their hands are strengthened , than any dislike showed by thee in bearing thy witness as thou oughtest to do against them ; for thou knowest of some in this city and elsewhere , whom we know to be just men , who suffers imprisonment and the loss of their liberties , because for conscience sake they cannot , swear , and many others in this nation furthering cruel things upon the like or same ground , even for well doing , and not for evil , which oppression Might be removed , and their unjust sufferings taken off by thee , by a word from thy mouth or pen , and this makes it to appear that thou canst not be clear in the sight of God in these things , because not helped by thee who hath the power to help it , and this is true love ; i give thee to understand in the day of recompense shalt thou know the Lord will not clear thee , except thou repent and ease the oppressed ; other things thou speakest about the light of Christ , which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world with the light of life , or with the light of condemnation , and about the ministry of this nation , with some other things which i had a desire to have answered if time had been seasonable , and thou willing to have heard , but thou shouldst not have appeared in such lightness , especially when speaking of the things of God which did grieve the spirit of the Lord , and vex the righteous soul , which behaviour with some words which thou utteredst with the light of Christ , is to be condemned , and which i do judge with the life of God , and yet doth tender and preserve the measure of justness and honesty which is in thee , but thou art high above the principle of God , and cannot receive the teachings of the father into that mind which is light and unstable , for the council of God is manifest to the meek and to the lowly , but there is much in thee to be judged when thou comest to the witness of God in thee ; and as concerning the light of Christ at which thou stumblest , by which every man that comes into the world is enlightened ; in short this i say , the light to thee is given of God , and it must thou own to be thy only teacher , to receive by it from the father , and to be guided by it in all things if ever thou inherit God's kingdom of righteousness and peace , and this is the word of the Lord to thee ; and as concerning the ministry of England for which in part thou seems to plead , thus i say in plainness , generally it is not of God but of Anti-christ , and the Lord is against it , for it is the ground of the greatest oppression of the poor in its maintenance , as any one particular abomination which this day is in the nation , and this is the truth from the Lord , and if thou set thyself to uphold them by any law made , or to make against such whom God hath raised to bear witness against them their ways and idolatries , thou shalt fall with them into perdition , and be overthrown amongst them in the just and righteous judgements , and this is the word of the Lord to thee ; for God is risen of a truth to make war against the beast which long hath reigned , and against the false prophets which hath long deceived the world , and i warn thee with hold thy hand from helping them , if thou mean to be preserved or blessed in thy person , in thy family and in thy armies ; for as i said to thee , the kingdom of Christ is setting up by his own power , and all must bow and become subject thereunto , he needs none of thy policy , nor the strength of thy arm to advance him , yet would he have thee nor to prove thyself an open enemy thereof , by doing or suffering to be done cruelty and injustice against them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this world into subjection unto that kingdom , least thou be such a one as will not enter thyself nor suffer others to enter , and & so destruction come upon thee ; wherefore arise as out of sleep and slumber not in this world's glory and honour , come away and appear for the Lord rather than against him , be not overcome by the pleasures of this world , nor the flattering titles of men , wink not at the cruelty and oppression acted by some who shelters under thee , and makes thy name a cloak for mischief against the upright , but let the testimony of God in thee answer for his persons ; this law is not just by which many suffers because they cannot swear , and because they cannot cease to declare against sin and iniquity , let that of God in thee bear witness , and thou and thy name being chief in the execution of this law , what will thy account be to the Lord in his day ? Consider i say consider , and be thou changed in thy mind and heart , least thou having forgotten God and his many deliverances , be shut up and numbered for destruction , and i say and desire the Lord give thee a more perfect understanding of his ways and judgements , and that the crown immortal thou Mayest strive for , by meekness and righteousness through relieving the oppressed , and showing mercy to the poor , and removing every burden which lies upon the innocent , and this is the desire of him who is thy friend and would not have thee crowned with dishonour , through suffering the persons of God to be oppressed in thy name , which will be thy overthrow absolutely if thou remove it not by returning and easing the oppressed .

Friend , 

Thou oughtest to stand in the coucel of God in all things , and not to follow the council of thy own heart , nor to act things in thine own will , neither shouldst thou suffer others to act under thee , and in thy name that which is unjust , and unrighteous ; much unrighteousness , and great oppression is acted in thy name , by which the good name ( Protector ) is abused and subverted , and instead of protection by it , great unjustice is acted under it and covered with it ; and this one thing i am moved to lay before thee , which hath been acted by thee or under thee , not without thy knowledge , in which thou hast done evil in the sight of the Lord , and one day thou wilt know it ; several in these nations justices of the peace and other officers who have been in trust under thee , when they have owned the persons of God in scorn called Quakers , have been cast out of their places though they have not denied to serve thee and the commonwealth , neither hath unfaithfulness to their trust been proved against them , and also several soldiers now of late in Scotland and elsewhere , have been turned out of their places because of the same thing , ( viz. ) for owning the persons of God , and these things are not right in the sight of the Lord , that such who have been for many years faithful in the service and in their trust , and hazarded life and liberty for conscience sake , to enjoy liberty of conscience , which they cannot now possess because of thee , but are cast out for the exercise of their pure conscience , this thing the Lord is grieved with , and with thee because of it , for thou didst not obtain this victory of peace and freedom by thy own sword , then why should it be thus improved to thy own ends ? Consider of it , for this makes the nations more unhappy and less blessed , when such who delight in true justice and judgement are cast out of their places , and so deprived of giving their judgement among men , and absolutely this will make thy army less prosperous and more unblessed , when such who feareth the Lord , and against whom thou cannot justly charge evil , are cast out and despised , and this in time thou Mayest see to thy sorrow , and as thy friend i lay this before thee , and do in plainness tell thee , if thou thus utterly deny the persons of God in the day of thy prosperity , and thus wholly cast them out of thy service , they cannot stand by thee nor own thee in the day of thy trouble , and such as thou cleavest unto May be a broken staff in thy time of need ; ah friend , these things do show that thy heart is not right in the sight of the Lord , and that justice and true judgement , righteousness and truth is even despised in this land , and not encerely owned by thee , when as such who feareth the Lord , are thus cast out of judicatories in thy government , and out of defence in thy armies ; what , is this the end of that long travel in wars , and of so many fair promises of liberty of conscience , that just men should thus be dealt withal , the heathen kingdoms May mock at this , that while some have pretended liberty of conscience , are become persecutors of such whose consciences are justly exercised , and as i have some time said to thee , much injustice and great oppressions and cruel persecutions continues daily to be acted in thy name , which is numbered up against thee upon account , because of hiding thy face from the cry of the poor , as one without bowels of compassion unto such who have truly served with thee in a faithful service for the commonwealth , who many of them now are grievious sufferers under thee . 

Consider of these things , and search what will be the end of them , the Lord open thy understanding , that more of the wisdom of God May guide thee , and less of the policy and wisdom of man , which will betray thee of God's kingdom , and May in the end cast thee down in this world also

Friend , 

It is upon me , and also i am pressed in spirit thereunto , to give unto thee , even unto thee Oliver protector , the perfect measure of thy dominions , and how they stand in relation to thee as concerning the affections of the persons towards thee , whereby thou Mayest understand thy own condition , and the state of thy government as i have viewed it in true judgement , and marked it upon serious consideration , and what i writ is in perfect love unto thee , how ever thou Mayest judge of it , and of these things it will be well for thee to consider , now while it is time ere it be too late . 

Many enemies thou hast which watches over thee for evil and not for good , who would rejoice in thy overthrow ; and first there is a persons scattered through all these nations who is full of wrath and ravening envy towards thee , even of those known by the name of malignant's party , in whose hearts to this day there is continual hatred , and evil surmising lodgeth against thee and all thy offspring ; and i believe ( Without any further knowledge ) that daily advantage they seek against thee , by subtle conspiracies and secret plottings , of maliciousness in their evil hearts , seeking by all means if it be possible how to be avenged , and not sliping any advantage how to revenge themselves , and the cause of their King , and of these scattered under thy government is not a few but rather the greater number , who thus stands in affections to thee , with no better purpose of good towards thee , then to destroy thee by any means if it were in their power , and to take away thy name in reproach , such is the cruelty and desperateness of some of them , their own lives are not dear unto them , to take away thine ; i have felt the strength of their rage against thee , which carries them above sense , or fear to forego any danger that they Might see their desired end of thee ; their malice towards thee is so seated in their wrathful hearts , that it cannot easily be quenched , i know the Lord hath cursed them and their endeavours to this day , and thou hast had dominion and power given thee of God to bruise them , and to break them to pieces ; and what thou hast done unto their King should not be reckoned against thee by the Lord , if now thou wert faithful to what he requireth of thee ; for because of the wickedness of that generation which was grown to the full , did the Lord raise thee up as a plague upon them , because of their unrighteousness , oppression and tyranny , and they were made as slaves and bondmen under thy power , and without the Lord can they not at any time do any thing against thee , but what and if for thy wickedness in the sight of God , he should make them instruments in his hand to accomplish his wrath upon thee , even like as he made thee once his instrument to overthrow them , and such hath been the Lord's doings , even to overthrow his enemies one by the other , and to use the wicked as a rod in his hand , to break them one against another like potsherds ; and by that which comes to pass in these nations , thou seems no less than to tread in their steps , and in a measure already goes on in their way in oppressing ( Through tyranny , or suffering it ) the persons of God whose cause the Lord will assuredly plead against thee one day , who now suffers under thee in patience , and who can tell the purpose of the Lord , or what he May bring to pass concerning this thing , in raising up the wicked to be a plague to wickedness , and in suffering the oppressors to overthrow oppressions ? this is by me in love to thee in sencerity declared , and by thee with soberness and in the fear of God it is to be considered . 

Again there is another persons scattered through all these dominions , who is not thy friends nor wishers well unto thee or thy government , who secretly murmurs against thee , and envies thee , and even seeks God against thee and thy government , which they judge to be not according to God , and bows not to it in love ; though they are forced to submit for a time , hoping continually if not hatching other ways of rule and government to the overthrow of thee and thine ; and these are more honest , and upright , and just in the sight of the Lord than the former ; and indeed they are not nor their purposes accursed of the Lord , for many of them have been sufferers , and faithfully served their nation with perfect purpose of freedom to the Lord's persons , and they have at this day perfect zeal for God and for his ways , though not altogether according to knowledge , yet some of them are not far from the kingdom of God ; though they seek it not wholly in the right way , nor looks only with a single eye ; yet doth not the Lord hate them altogether because of their integrity towards him and zeal for him ; who some of them have suffered imprisonment for truth and righousness sake , as they have wholly thought ; and their suffering hath not been altogether slighted by the Lord ; and these are they known by name of the fifth monarchy , of whom there is more than a few , with them that wishes well unto them , who will rise up for them rather than for thee , many of whom propounds well in their minds , though they have not power to effect it , because their intent is not altogether according to the Lord , yet are many of them free from that whereof thyself is guilty , and some of them are cast out and wholly rejected without any just cause , as they suppose , and these things have grieved their spirits , and not only kindled their rage and envy , but moved their sincerity and honesty against thee ; wherefore they are not thy friends but rather thy enemies ; and would not stand by thee or with thee in thy need , but rather i suppose would arm themselves against thee and thy power , who highly charges thee ( As they suppose justly too ) with unfaithfulness and such like , for they see that is not accomplished which hath been promised by thee , but the contrary , even one finger is become as heavy as was once the loins ; and their spirits are grieved against thee for such causes , and who knows but that the Lord May take the occasion to try thee and prove thee by them , for their hearts are high against thee and thy government , and that upon good ground , as they sincerely think . 

Again , there is through thy dominions a persons gathered and gathering daily by multitudes , who are called and chosen of him and faithful to him , who hath owned him above all things , and whom he hath owned and will own in the sight of the whole world , and will increase them to a numberless number , according to his promise ; and even those the Lord is making many who are redeeming out of the world , into the government and kingdom of Jesus Christ , and these thou knowest are great and grievous sufferers ; by many hard and cruel oppressions , from those who are in authority in thy government , even unjust imprisonment and fines and burdensome taxations , in many things hard to be expressed ; and they undergo grievous persecutions under thy government , and wholly unjustly in the sight of God , and also are cast out of all power and place in it , and almost out of all subjects' privilege too ; many of them being Counted as vile amongst men , though they are not so in the sight of the Lord , justice , and righteousness and true judgement they cannot have in all these nations , not from thyself nor subservant judges , of whom hardly can their cause be heard : but are deprived of their proper right , and of subject's freedom in judicatories , and exposed to all wrong that May be by unjust men through unjust judgement , and these things are not unknown to thee , and therefore art thou inexcusable in the sight of the Lord , and guilty of their sufferings in his presence , who hath power to prevent it but doth it not , and these thus suffering in thy government and under it , how can they stand for thee and thy government , or out of pure love be subject thereunto , though be it known to thee that we ( The persons of God ) doth not envy thy person or government in the least , neither hath purpose of seeking advantage against thee , or it to hurt or betray you by secret plotting or turbulent arising , as others May , yet friend the want of our prayers to God for thee , is worse to thee then the secret plotting of all wicked men . 

And how can we mention thee in our prayers to God except it be to be delivered from thee , who are daily cruel and unjust sufferers by thee or because of thee , as i have said , or how can we be friends to that government , or subject to obey that power under which we daily suffer such hard and cruel things , as the loss of our liberty and estates , and danger of life also ? let that light in thy own conscience judge , though for all these things , we do rather pity thee , and desires thy repentance , than conspires against thee , or wisheth thy destruction , yet oughtest thou to consider of these things with a humble heart , and what a condition thou art in , who is hated of the wicked with deadly hatred , and not loved of the saints because thou lovest not the Lord ; also it Might make thy heart to tremble to consider how that thy dominions are thus divided , and the affections of the persons thus disunited , and few of them thy real friends , some having real offence given by thee ; wherefore they are forced to loath that government which is unjust ; and others verily supposing of great wrong sustained from thee , wherefore they are turned against thee . 

Moreover & besides all this , greatly it May be suspected that even they in whom thou dost repose confidence , who seems to cleave unto thee , May not be altogether true unto thee , though in appearance subject , yet May have secret hypocrisy and hatching of evil in their minds , if it were possible , to uncover thy nakedness , and some others also there May be , who May make use of places under thee , which May have no more affection to thee nor service for thee , then while their own ends of great advantage are served under thee , by their subjection to thy government ; and now friend , these things being justly considered and viewed by thee in righteousness , how is thy dominions as a broken vessel , that cannot easily be bound up , and as a bruised reed not to be confided in by thee ? and these several sorts of persons being subtracted out of the whole , how few is it that thou wilt find that are thy real and faithful friends , who May stand by thee in a needful time ; some out of envy cannot be subject to thee , and others for the fear of the Lord's sake cannot own thee in such a government , whereby the just suffers , even all men are ready to stand afar off from thee , and because thou hast denied the persons of God , therefore cannot he be thy trust ; and verily thy state and the state of thy dominions are truly to be lamented , thou hast so much sought thyself , that thou hast lost almost all persons and their affections , every one judging themselves to be the greatest sufferers under thee ; ah consider , for thou art but the head of a disjointed body , which May not easily be bound up to thee ; and thou art lost for lack of true knowledge , for the Lord hath done many things for thee though thou hast not known it altogether , and much less than knowest thou of those things which are eternal , which belongs to thy peace , it shows thou owns not the Lord who cannot own his persons , but rather Counts them thy enemies and suffers all evil to be inflicted upon them ; and this is the greatest of thy misery , in that the Lord hath been so good unto thee , and thy promises so large towards him for the freedom of his persons , and yet all forgot and the Lord's goodness not answered , and his persons made as slaves and bondmen under thee , suffering the loss of liberty , and even their birthright privilege in many parts of these nations ; wherefore be awakened oh man , and sleep not totally in carelessness , but remember thyself , either to perform the good , or at least to escape the evil which May suddenly come upon thee . 

And this i have written to thee out of perfect love in the fear of God , without the fear of any man , or without any secret or open envying of thee , couldst thou but own the Lord , he would be thy strength to forgive all thy iniquities and blot out thy sin , and to defend thee from all thy enemies ; and above all things love judgement , mercy and truth , and fear before the Lord , and let not his persons be thy bondslaves , who is more dear unto the Lord than all earthly glory is unto thee , and if thou couldst own them , they would own thee in the face of all thine enemies , many times hast thou been warned , and that from the Lord , and thou shalt confess it , when the Lord's hand is upon thee and thou delivered into the will of thy enemies , remember that i have told thee what the Lord hath showed me , happy art thou if thou canst receive it , that peace May be unto thee and not war , salvation and not condemnation , renown and not dishonour , which waits for thee , except thou turn to the Lord .

To the protector and counsel . 

A servant of the Lord , and to you a friend wisheth grace and wisdom , the spirit of sound judgement , and the knowledge of God unto you , that in all things true justice and righteous judgement May be brought forth , and abound unto all persons , that you May be more honourable , and May be made a blessing to yourselves and this nation , and to generations after you ; but alas my friends , how long shall justice and true judgement be neglected , and the innocent deeply groan for want thereof ? how long shall it be ere the distressed cry of the unjustly afflicted enter into your hearts , i say when shall your ear be bowed down to hearken to , and consider of the guiltless cause of many of the faithful subjects , who lies deeply afflicted through this nation , some under one cruel bond of oppression and some under another , being most unjustly and wickedly imposed upon them by cruel men , who perverts justice and turneth true judgement backward , and neither fears God nor regards men , but contrary to justice and the good laws of this land , as men without reason and natural affections to mankind , doth act most illegally , to the grievous oppression of many approved & faithful subjects , and the true knowledge and consideration hereof is enough to pierce the hardest heart , and to vex the most patient mind , and undoubtedly the fierce anger of the Lord is greatly kindled because of these things , and even against your forbearance , who seems to take little notice of such cruelties and in justice when they are laid before you ; for you do not relieve the oppressed , neither doth remove oppressors as you ought to do , and as the Lord requireth of you ; what , hath the abundance of this world's glory and its treasure quite overcome and stolen away your hearts wholly from all sense and feeling of the unjust sufferings of your brethren , who have in times past as faithfully as yourselves served their nation with their lives and estates , to the purchasing of this peace and freedom out of the hands of tyrants , and such May now justly claim the benefit of this peace and freedom , and to have a part with you therein , even by birthright , and by purchase , and also by promise from some of yourselves ? but alas , while they have waited for it and thought peaceably to enjoy the same under you , are many of them entrapped into as great bondage as ever , if not more woeful and unjust , and they are unjustly imprisoned and unreasonably fined , and every way oppressively dealt withal , and are even spoilt in their persons and estates , & their lives often in danger , being through great injustice become a prey to their very enemies , who now takes occasion to revenge their former cause because of their faithfulness for the commonwealth against them , and all this is done while you look on , and no way showing your dislike to these things , which strengtheneth greatly the hands of evil doers , to add to the bonds of the afflicted , yet are you without excuse , for you are not wholly ignorant of these things , for the knowledge of them hath often been laid at your doors , yea and the very cry of these oppressions and cruelties reacheth through the whole land , to the wounding deeply of all persons that fears God , to know so great injustice and oppression brought forth upon the innocent and faithful persons , by some so far entrusted as having the law committed to them ; which they pervert and turns judgement backward , and the greater is the wound because you who have power to stop and prevent these things , should no more regard to set at liberty the unjust sufferers , and to render judgement upon those as thus perverts true justice , by whom the land is filled with violence , whereby the name of the Lord is greatly dishonoured , and the government greatly reproached in many parts of the world , why , because the faithful subjects cannot enjoy their birthright privilege , as they ought , according to the law of God and man ; for their equals , yea their inferiors have exalted themselves above and are become oppressors of the free born persons , & divers ways doth these heinous oppressions & cruelties abound upon the innocent , and not for evil doing but for the exercise of their pure consciences towards God ; for many hath been taken travelling on the high way , and some out of peaceable meetings , and some out of their inns and friends houses , and by some wicked men in authority , without showing just cause therefore , have just innocent men been whipped , or stocked , or imprisoned , or other cruelties done unto them , and yet the transgression of no just law truly charged against them , neither have been convicted of any evil doing , but they have suffered wholly innocently , only through the malice and will and pleasure of their enemies , who have taken occasion without any just offence at all to stock and whip and imprison many of the true and faithful subjects , and this hath not been done in secret but openly in many parts of this nation , and you have had information of these things , that you should have been awakened to true justice & judgement , and this the Lord requireth of you , though the guiltless sufferers have born all these things without complaining , yet ought you to have judged justly , according to their deeds , such as caused such cruelty and unjust sufferings , that for time to come the like Might not have been brought forth , but the free subjects Might live in peace , and rejoice under the government , and all perverters of judgement and justice Might stand in awe and be afraid , so should you be a praise to ages after you , and likewise many who are at this present remaining in prisons in divers parts of this land , some upon one false accusation and evil surmizing , and some upon another , for a good conscience sake ; the cause of whom hath often been laid before you , which seemed for the present to have some entrance upon you , yet little is brought forth by you as ought to be in that cause , for though none of any such doth complain unto you , who have and doth unjustly suffer , yet the Lord doth require you to set the oppressed and falsely imprisoned at liberty , and to bring true judgement forth upon their persecutors ; also there is another suffering great and grievous growing upon many , if it be not prevented , many faithful and approved men are dispossessed of their freedom , which truly belongeth to them by the law of God and man in divers cities and corporations , because for conscience sake they cannot swear , by kissing the book and laying the hand upon it , according to the vain tradition in such causes formerly used ; though to deal justly towards God and man in their craft and science they are bound by the law of God , yet because they will not swear , and so break Christ's commands , are they threatened , and their windows shut up , and disprivileged of their trading , whereby they should maintain themselves and families in the creation ; and this one thing tendeth to the destruction of many , as in this world , and no little hurt will thereby grow to the whole nation in a generation of time , and it is required of you by the Lord to prevent these sufferings , though many can forgo their own freedom in this world , and their lives also , rather than break the least command of Christ , and thus are many faithful persons made a very prey to their enemies , and in divers manners it is brought forth upon them ; for many also suffers deeply in the house of correction , for reproving sin , and others are grievously spoilt in their estates , because for conscience sake they cannot pay to maintain a professed minister , or uphold a steeplehouse , for it is a common thing for a priest to take ( Or have it done ) four or five times so much by distress as any way he can prove a pretended due ; and many other sufferings there are , which are only for conscience sake , as because some cannot put off a hat to a magistrate , or the like ; which gives an ill savour to the government in which they are acted without reproof . Ah my friends ! be awakened to justice and true judgement , to relieve such unjust sufferers , and to throw down all such heinous oppressions and oppressors , that the Lord May yet make you and your government blessed , after his long suffering to you which hath been great ; for justice and true judgement in a government is the happiness thereof , and the foundation for a long continuance ; and on the contrary , cruelty , and injustice , and oppression being brought forth , the more is the government unhappy and accursed , and the sooner will the Lord overthrow it , and bring it to a desolate end ; and therefore my friends , let this great enemy to your persons , government and whole nation , to wit , persecution for conscience sake , be speedily removed , least the anger of the Lord break forth against you , and repentance be too late , for this know , in all ages the Lord stretched forth his hand , and in his time he quickly avenged himself for his people's sake , after their innocent sufferings born by them for a season , and he is the same and changeth not , and the same will he bring to pass ; therefore i say again , be awakened , and let that deadly enemy be removed out of the land , as you tender your own safety and honour , and the glory of the name of the Lord , and his people's peace , even this very enemy , to wit , persecution for conscience sake , for it doth and will obstruct all your good purposes at home and abroad ; it eats away the affections of all good persons from you , and it eats out your strength and valour , and it consumes the weakness of all your enemies ; verily , it is an enemy that will work your destruction speedily , both in this world and in the world to come , that of God in ye all shall witness me in the day of the Lord ; i am your friend , and these things do i write as a friend unto you , as to warn you of that secret enemy , so much reigning and rebelling in this nation , which indeed May work a greater destruction upon you then any foreign invader , and this in time you May witness to your grief and sorrow , if something by you be not done to suppress it ; all health and peace i wish unto you in the Lord , and thus far am i clear from the blood of you and all men , come life or death .

Oh! Oliver , 

Hadst thou been faithful , and thundered down the deceit , the Hollander had been thy subject , and tributers ; and Germany had given up to have done thy will ; and the Spaniard had quivered like a dry leaf , wanting the virtue of God ; the King of France should have bowed under thee his neck ; the Pope should have withered as in winter ; the Turk in all his fatness should have smoked ; thou shouldst not a stood trifling about small things , but minded the work of the Lord , as he began with thee at first ; sober men and true hearts took part with thee . Oh! take heed , and do not slight such , least thou weaken thyself , and not disown such as the Lord hath owned , thy dread is not yet all gone , nor thy amazement ; arise and come out , for hadst thou been faithful , thou shouldst have crumbled nations to dust , for that had been thy place ; now is thy day of trial , take heed of joining hands with the wicked against the innocent , but hear the voice of God , and that will keep thee from hardness of heart , and mind the law of God , with which thou Mayst answer that of God in every one , and his fear and his dread to be in thy family , and that thou Mayst come to break the jaws of the wicked , that rends the innocent ; and that thou Mayst be eyes to the blind , and legs to the lame , and an help to them that cannot help themselves ; and take heed that any of thy servants that be under thy dominion of quenching the spirit , or limiting the holy one , but wait for the wisdom of God , that with it thou Mayst order all to God's glory , and all his creatures , by which wisdom they were create and made , and that thou Mayst find the blessing of the Lord God with thee ; and take heed of flatterers , and take heed of wild light spirits , that will speak thee fair , but mind sober men , for there is mischief in many minds ; but if thou be kept in the power of God , and live in it , thou wilt live over all , and stop and cross and tread under the intents of wicked men ; and take heed in any thing they be not thy executioners , for now thou hast time , prize it .

Dear friend , 

Be still , and in the counsel of God stand , and that will give thee wisdom , that thou Mayst frustrate men's end , and calm men's spirits , and crumbel men under , and arise and stand up in the power of the Lord God , the lamb's authority , and fear not the face of man , but fear and dread the Lord God , than his presence and wisdom and counsel thou shalt have to throw down the rubbish , and quell all the bad spirits under thy dominion , and fear them about thee ; live in the Lord's power and life , then to thee he will give wisdom , and the pure feeling thou wilt come into , whereby thy soul will be refreshed , and it will be thy delight to do the will of God , and thy meat and drink , as thou in the pure eternal power , counsel , will and wisdom of God dwells , things all will be made plain before thee , and to thee from the Lord God , in what thou dost for the Lord God thou shalt have peace and the blessing , and in that so doing , all the sober true hearted persons will be one with thee in travels , sorrows and pains , and then in that a blessing from the Lord will come upon thee , will abound to thee and cover thee , as thou lives and art kept in the power and dread of the Lord God of heaven and earth , where wisdom is not wanting , nor peace lacking , but peace enjoyed , and counsel and instruction from the Lord God given , and the helping arm and hand that stretcheth over all the nations in the world , thou wilt feel it , and with that thou wilt come to break down all men's ends that they have to themselves , and the worships that men invent , and images they have set up , for the arm of the Lord helps the righteous , by his hand he carries the lambs , which arm is turned against the wicked stretched over them , and the hand of the Lord is against them that do evil , in which hand the soul is , and brings it into peace ; therefore live in the power of the Lord God , and feel his hand that is stretched out over the nations , for a mighty work hath the Lord to do in other nations , and their quakings and shakings is but entering . So this is the word of the Lord God to thee , and a charge to thee from the Lord God , in the presence of the Lord God , live in the power of the Lord God of heaven and earth , that will make all nations to tremble and quake , for those be God's enemies that be out of his power and counsel , and be thou faithful to God singlely , without respecting any man's person , but respect the Lord and his work , and be obedient to his will singlely , without any end to thyself , living in the pure wisdom , counsel and instruction from God , then wilt thou see God's enemies that live out of God's wisdom , power and counsel , fall in their pits , snare themselves , fear where there is no fear , slaying themselves with their envy , and the power of the Lord will clear all the wicked off of thee , as thou lives in it , and art kept in it , and this is the word of the Lord God to thee , and live in the wisdom and life of God , that with it thou Mayst be ordered to his glory , and order his creatures to his glory , and be still and silent from thy own wisdom , wit , craft , subtlety or policy that would arise in thee , but stand single to the Lord , without any end to thyself , than God will bless thee , and prosper thee in his ways , thou wilt feel his blessing in thy generation , and thy mind stayed upon the Lord , thou wilt be kept in perfect peace , without any intent to thyself , to the glory of the Lord God , and there wilt thou feel no want , nor a failing nor forsaking , but the presence of the Lord God of life with thee ; for now the state of this present age is , the Lord is a bringing his persons into the life which the scriptures were given forth from , in which his persons shall come to have unity with God , with the scriptures , and one with another , for their establishing is in righteousness , truth and peace , in which is the kingdom of God .

For the protector . 

Friend , 

The salutation of my life wisheth well unto thee in the Lord , and most especially that thy precious soul May be reedeemed out of death to God , and live , that thou Mayest have a rest and habitation in him , when this world is no more . 

Now whereas it is a general outcry among the teachers and persons of this nation , and also is doubted and hath been sometime objected by thyself , that the persons called Quakers are deluded and deceived , and in error , and such like ; and now if it be possible that thyself and and others May be resolved concerning us ; put therefore all thy objections and doubtings into plain positions , or let the wisest of thy teachers do it for thee , and whatsoever thyself or any for thee can object against us , or what thou doubtest of , or stumblest at , either in respect of our doctrines or practice , let the matter be stated in plain words , in positions or queries , and if God permit , a sufficient answer thou Mayst receive , to remove all conscienceous scruples , and to confound all subtle alleadgments and evasions , whereby hereafter for ever thou Mayst be altogether inexcusable of all doubting or speaking against us , or suffering evil to be done or spoken against us upon that account ; and this am i moved to give forth and send to thee , that thou Mayst be satisfied , and all things tried and made manifest in the sight of all men , and that all rash judgement and false supposition , which lodgeth in the hearts of many , May be confounded and brought to naught , and let it be left off , to cry out deceivers and heresy , &c. and causing any to suffer upon suspicion thereupon , but bring all things to light and true judgement , that what is proved to be the truth May be owned , and not persecuted any more , for we are willing to be made manifest to all men , and if any thing be objected against us , which May not be sufficiently answered and resolved to sober men , than our enemies are more free , and hath whereof to glory in against us ; but and if all occasions of stumbling be removed by answers according to the scriptures , and our principles , practices and doctrines thereby vindicated , then let all the teachers and all our adversaries shut their mouths from biting at us , and railing against us , and accusing of us to thee , and let thy ear be shut from believing lies against the innocent , and let none suffer in thy dominion under the cruelty of men upon such a ground ; and hereof i should be glad to receive an answer , and to join issue in this cause , and in the mean time always am a lover of thy soul , but a witness against all oppression ;

For the protector . 

friend , know that there is a God that doth whatsoever he will , all power is in his hand , and he bringeth to pass the counsel of his own heart , and he rules in the kingdoms of men , & bringeth down & setteth up , he killeth & maketh alive , & he changeth times & seasons & governments , & bringeth to naught the counsels of men , for all power in earth and in heaven is in him ; and all his doings are right , and his ways are equal ; and thou and all mankind are as clay in the hand of the potter , he can honour and exalt as he pleaseth , and he can mar and break to pieces and dishonour whensoever he will , wherefore be humble and low in heart before him , for he is the highest power that subdueth all things under his feet ; if he wound who can heal ? and if he kill there is none can make alive ; and know thou it is the Lord God almighty that doth this ; in whose hands are the issues of life and death , and he it is who can break thee down and build thee up , who can wound thee and restore thee , and bring thee to destruction , and say unto thee return , and to know him that doth this , belongs to thy eternal peace . 

Wherefore hearken thou to the word of the Lord , that thy soul May come out of death and live ; and fear the Lord God , before whom thy heart is naked and bare ; who can mould thee and change thee , and fulfil his pleasure upon thee , even according to his own will , and who shall say what doth he ? and now come to consideration , and let thy heart be more upright before him , & choose his way and counsel , that he May bless thee , and seek his face to behold his countenance , that thy soul May be satisfied by his word , and the milk of the word May nourish thee unto life immortal , and mind his pure presence which is life , even God with thee ; Christ the Immanuel to dwell with and walk in thee ; which is the promise of the father ; and first come to the principle of God , and feel the word of God in thy heart , that will beat down the nature into which temptations enters , and the word will bring thee to war against and to overcome all thy enemies , which would defile thee or betray thee ; and it will bring thee to know a birth immortal born in thee , and a crown immortal received from God that dyes not nor fades not away , and then he that rules over heaven and earth will be thy shepherd to feed thee , and thy teacher to guide thee , and thy counsellor to direct thee in all things ; and thy immortal soul will be satisfied with the bread that cometh down from heaven which the father giveth , and the covenant of God and the mercies of David that are sure will be revealed , and his promise fulfilled in thee ; and life and immortality brought to light through the gospel which is the power of God , which destroys and puts off , and confounds the first man and his knowledge ; and wisdom , and his sin and righteousness , all which is in transgression against the life of God , and the gospel the power of God being received , it will raise up the seed of God in thee , and bring thee to know the second Adam , the image of the father which the devil hath nothing in , but he overcomes the devil who hath been the lamb slain by transgression , since the foundation of the world ; and he it is that comes out of death that must take away thy sin and destroy it , and cover thy nakedness , and create thee a new , and give thee acceptance in the father whereby thy soul in him May be refreshed , and a habitation in him thou Mayst have when this world is no more , and for this thou oughtest to wait above all things . 

And friend , thou hast need of the wisdom of God , which is from heaven to guide thee in all thy affairs , that by it thou May be preserved from the will of thine enemies , and from all that hate thee , that their eye May be blinded that watch for evil , and their wisdom and policy confounded and brought to naught that hatches mischief against thee ; so feel a measure of the wisdom of God in thee to guide thee in dread and authority , and thy enemies will be afraid ; for to walk in the fear of the Lord and in his wisdom and authority , in justice , truth and righteousness , that will make thee a greater terror unto thy enemies then all worldly policy and craft ; the nations will over reach thee , if thy strength be there , and if judgement , justice and righteousness be neglected by thee , how should the Lord honour thee and defend thee ; nay he will bring dishonour , and give thee into the will of thy enemies ; for want of truth and just judgement causeth a land to mourn , and her persons to sit as a widow comfortless , wherefore love judgement , truth and righteousness , and walk therein , and thou wilt leave a praise behind thee and a witness to other ages that thou hast served the Lord in thy generation , and then thy memorial shall never die , nor thy name come into reproach among the heathen ; wherefore let all oppression be removed , and let the just go free , and let judgement and righteousness run down , and be thou a praise and a blessing to all that do well , and a rerrour and a dread to all the contrary ; arise and stand up for the Lord , and he will give thee strength and victory , and will make thy horn as iron and thy hoof as brass to push down down and tread under the high places of idolatry , in all the apostatised churches both Papists and others out of the life of the apostles , and as thou comes into the life the apostles were in , than thou wilt see and fathom over all this profession of Christ , and all these churches that are without the life of Christ which is come up in the apostasy , and as the life of God ariseth in thee thou wilt see who the false prophets are and deceivers which Christ prophesied of should come , and John saw were come in his days , which hath overspread the nations , and these are they which hath the sheep's clothing upon them ; but inwardly they are ravening wolves , and such are they that will flatter thee for great benefits and places , and large maintenance , they have Christ's words and the apostles words , the sheep's clothing , but they that put not into their mouths they will prepare war against them , and raven upon them , cast their bodies into prison or spoil their goods ; and wilt thou bring thy name into dishonour to all the saints upon earth , by defending of these in their evil ways , thou oughtest not to do it , nor to suffer the innocent to be trodden down and destroyed for denying such , and witnessing against them that are out of the life of Christ , and a great overthrow will the Lord make among those teachers , and such a ministry that need to be defended by carnal weapons , and by stocks and prisons ; for such teachers and ministry is not of Christ , as is manifest ; and as persons have been scattered after them for ages , so they shall again be gathered from them by the spirit , to follow the lamb whethersoever he goes . 

And take heed these teachers come not too near thee , neither put confidence in them , for their hearts are not right before the Lord ; and they will flatter thee while they hatch evil against thee , but stand over them in the dominion of God ; and if they sow spiritual things , let them reap carnal by a free gift , and if they have flocks let them eat of the milk freely given them , and if they have planted any thing let them eat the fruit , as it comes freely , and be not thou cumbered about maintaining ministers , but free thyself of that burden , neither suffer innocent men to be trodden down and destroyed in their persons and estates about the maintaining of such teachers , which is become the grievousest oppression in the nation . 

And as concerning thy family , thou hast need of God's wisdom to guide thee , that thou Mayest rule in God's authority over all light , loose , proud , wanton , ungodly , and deceitful persons ; take heed of such spirits , for they will be a temptation to thee to draw thee into evil , and into the world out from God , let no such be thy companions , nor remain in thy house , lest they betray thee with flatteries and honour which perisheth , and such profess much love and great duty in words , yet they being out of the fear of the Lord , cannot be blessed unto thee in their service ; wherefore love such men and let them be thy companions that fear the Lord ; and that are solid and sober and upright , such as May be good examples before thee , which will quench evil and not increase it in thee ; and though such appear not in flatteries towards thee nor with a double mind , yet they will be faithful to thee , and such will the Lord bless unto thee ; and let no drunkards nor covetous , evil minded persons that seeks themselves and not the Lord have place with thee , for they will be a dishonour to thee , and bring the curse into thy family : and love such as makes conscience of their words & ways , and be not an oppressor of the tender conscience of any , but let the Lord be ruler there both in thyself & in all thy family ; and be of a pitiful , tender mind and spirit towards strangers and all persons ; and be kind and long suffering towards all , yet let justice reach to all transgressors , and be an example to all in authority under thee ; and let not evil and cruel hearted men bear any place , for such renders thee and thy government dishonourable , and by such the land is filled with violence , and the just mourns , whereby the blessing is kept far away , & the curse near , ready to devour : now friend , if thou come to be guided by the spirit , and with the wisdom of the father , than thou wilt bring the nations into good order , whereby the inhabitants May live in peace and perfect freedom from all oppressions and vexations that now is a bondage upon the just and upright , for there is great corruption entered into all places , and sorts of men , and when the Lord toucheth thy heart and makes thee rightly sensible of all things as now they stand , than thou wilt see the ministry as now it stands to be quite degenerated from what the ministry of Christ was in the days of the apostles , before the apostasy ; and as it now stands there is much of it which is to be thrown down to the ground , and crushed to pieces ; for it 's corrupted altogether , even in the way of its setting up and of its call ; and in the way of its maintenance and practice , in all these things it is corrupted and degenerated from what the ministry of Christ was before the apostasy ; and this May be proved by the scriptures , and so it is not to be upholden by thee , but to be corrected and thrown down the rather . 

And likewise in magistracy , thou wilt see great corruption entered , and abundance to be purged out , for it is much degenerated from the state as it was ordained of God , and in the laws there is much to regulate and correct , when thou comes to the principle of God in thee ; if ever that arise in thee , it will bring thee to thresh down and trample down all unjust men that handles the law , and all such that judge for gifts and rewards ; and all such lawyers that devours the innocent for gifts , that will not plead the cause of the poor without great fees ; and all the priests that preach for hire , and the teachers that teach for filthy lucere and to get gain , all such men will be Counted as briers and thorns by thee , to be plucked up by the roots , and to be cut up as evil trees which cumbers the ground , for such doth corrupt the land and cumbers it ; and if ever the Lord doth arise in thee he will reward them by thee according to their ways , whose ways are corrupt before the Lord . 

And as concerning thy war and armies abroad in Spain , something there is in it known to the Lord , seek not thy own honour in it , but be faithful , and leave the issue of all things to the Lord ; make no covenant with idolators , but tread down their idol gods that they have set up , and hew down their mountains in which their confidence stands , and plow up their ground that the seed May be sown after thee : its honour enough to be the Lord's ploughman , be thou faithful in what the Lord calls thee to , and thou shalt have thy reward , and seek his honour and he will honour thee ; and let thy mind be to the Lord in all things , and feel his word and power and presence in thee , to quench all that which is contrary , and then thou wilt be blessed in this life and in the life to come ; but if thou continue in thy oppression , the Lord will suddenly smite thee .

For Oliver Cromwell . 

Friend , 

The Lord hath visited thy house , because thou hast suffered thy servants , to smite the servants of the Lord , and lambs of Christ , and prisoned his lambs , and sons , and daughters , some until death ; therefore thy sons , and daughters , and servants will i take away with death , and visit thee and and thy house with sickness saith the Lord , and thou shalt know that i am the Lord who reigns ; therefore spare my sons and daughters , that i May spare thee and thy house , and that thou Mayest know that i am the Lord ; oh! how art thou fallen under men ? and thy house will suffer as long as my sons and daughters and servants suffers by thee and thy servants , and die in prison , and you not visiting them , nor suffer their own friends to visit them ; therefore take heed least thou become as weak as water . 

And friend , thou shouldst have invited all the Christians upon earth in all nations that are against popery to thee , to come in and join with thee against popery , for thou hast had authority , stand to it , loose it not , nor abuse it , nor let any other take thy crown , and do not stand cumbering thyself about dirty priests that flatter thee for means , for thou hast had fair warnings , and thou hast had power over nations , for nations begins to be upon heaps , and nations and tongues , and multitudes are waters , and the beast hath power over them who hath long reigned , and they begin to swell , and the whore sits upon them ; nevertheless , do not thou heed nor fear them , nor be of a doubtful mind , neither fear their amazements , but let thy heart be single to God , and wait , that the seed of God in thee May come until the top stone be laid , and invite all them that profess against the Pope in all nations to join with thee against him , and do not loose thy dominion nor authority , nor the wisdom of God , but with that thou May order all , that will keep thee single in heart and mind to the Lord , and let thy soldiers go forth with a free willing heart , that thou May rock nations as a cradle , and keep thou in the fear of the Lord , and all thy soldiers , and them that be under thee , this is a charge to thee in the presence of the Lord God , that thou nor them May lose the dread of the Lord , for that is it that strikes terror in the hearts of all persons , and set all the prison doors open for them to come forth that are imprisoned for churches and ministers maintenance , and worship , and learn the patience , for the Lord's work is begun already in other nations , and the patient spirit remains in the Lord's work , for that is it that tries , stands and abides , which gets the victory , and obtains the crown ; if any hurt come to thee , it will be through thy disobedience to the Lord . 

I am a lover of thy soul and eternal good , an establisher of righteousness . G. Fox . written the tenth of the 6th month , 1657.  

This is for the protectors kindred , his wife and children , to be read soberly by them in the fear of God . 

Friends , 

Remember , that by the Lord you were raised from a low state , and when he will , he can abase you and bring you down , he gave you the palace of Princes , and threw out the high and mighty before you , because of their wickedness , which was great in the sight of the Lord . 

Oh , remember this every one of you , and come to the witness of God in you , and be humble , and meek , and lowly , and let the Lord's fear be in your hearts , and be of a tender spirit , having your minds exercised in purity , in holiness , and in righteousness , and exalt not yourselves , nor be lifted up in your hearts in the pride and vain glories and honours of this world , least the Lord cast you down , and make your name and posterity a reproach , as he hath done many before you , even for that cause was the generations of the Stewarts cast out , and if you walk in the same steps , and do the same things , and become guilty of the same abominations , and suffer the children and servants of the Lord to be persecuted ( As many are at this day , some until death ) shall the Lord spare you ? nay , he will cause you to feel his hand of judgement , and bring you down with sorrow , and he will vex you in his wrath , and smite you with his rod more and more , till you learn his fear , and depart from all your iniquities , and the Lord will deface your glory , and pull down your crown , and he will make you know that he is the Lord that doth whatsoever he will ; wherefore humble yourselves under the hand of God , and search your own hearts , and cast out the abominations that vexeth the spirit of the Lord , and suffer not the persons of the Lord's precious flock to be devoured , and made a prey to the wicked , for because of this , the rod of affliction cometh upon you , and May suddenly break you to pieces ; but mind the seed of God in you , which is oppressed , and wait to know the power of the Lord which will redeem you out of sin and death , and reconcile you to God , and bring you into fellowship with himself , to enjoy peace and rest for your souls , that you May be made heirs of the inheritance of an endless life , and this would make you truly honourable , and will be more satisfaction to you , and joy and content , and true rejoicing , than all worldly crowns and worldly glories , which will waste and consume away , and leave you miserable ; and remember that you are now warned from the Lord God , by whom i am moved to write this unto you in dear and tender love to you all , and one day you shall witness it : and as concerning the Quakers ( So called ) who are accounted as vile in the sight of men , and are cast out of all power and place in the nation , being despised of all , and also are reproached , persecuted , and imprisoned , and all manner of evil and injustice unrighteously done and spoken against them ( By wicked and corrupt men in authority ) yet are they the children and servants of the living God , and greatly beloved of him , and are as dear to him as the apple of his eye , and his power and presence is with them , and the time is at hand that the Lord will make their persecutors fall , and their enemy's bow and tremble , though now they suffer unjustly , and are trodden down , as not deserving a place on the earth , yet it is for righteousness sake , and because they show forth the image of the father , and not for evil doing ; and will not their sufferings lie upon you ? for many hundred have suffered cruel and great things , and some the loss of life , though not by , ( Yet in the name of the protector ) and about a hundred at this present day lies in holes and dungeons , and prisons up and down the nation , and some at this time are sick nigh unto death , whose sufferings cries for vengeance , and the Lord heareth the cry ; wherefore save yourselves , and let the innocent be delivered , and the cruel bonds of oppression broken , and the exercise of a pure conscience go free without persecution , and then the Lord will turn away his anger , and cease to smite you with his rod which hath been upon you , and he will give you peace , and make you blessed if you come to be led by his spirit into all truth ▪ and though these innocent lambs of Christ suffer thus under this present power , yet are they not enemies to you , but are friends to your persons and families , and pities you , and loves you , and desires well for you in the Lord , that you May repent and be healed , and even that your hearts May be opened , to receive refreshments to your souls , and that you May be established in righteousness and truth over all your enemies , and May not be confounded , nor your posterity brought into reproach , which is hastening upon you , and though our love be disputed & we accounted hateful in your sight ; and looked upon with derision ; yet we bare all things in patience , truly desiring your returning and repentance , and not your destruction , but if these doleful sufferings of the Lord's poor lambs be continue by this present power , it will destroy you and undo you , and break you , and confound you ; and the Lord will not cease to smite you with his rod of sharp rebukes , and he will make you know his people's cause shall not be unpunished , oh did you but know how hundred have and do suffer , how the bodies of some have been tortured by stocks and cruel whippings , and how some lies sick in stinking holes and dungeons on the ground , or a little straw at best ; ten or often more in a prison together ; and sometimes their own friends not suffered to come to visit them with necessaries ; oh did but your eyes behold , or your hearts perceive the greatness of the cruelty which some of the Lord's dear servants and your faithful friends undergo , it would make your hearts ache , and your spirits to tremble , and all this is done in the name and under the authorty of ( protector ) therefore how should the Lord but lay it to your charge and afflict him and his family ; he will make you know there is a God , that can do whatsoever he will , and that life and death are in his hand , and all creatures are as clay in the hand of a potter , and he rules in the kingdoms of men , and pulleth down one , and setteth up another according to his pleasure , but if the love of God be withheld from you , it is because of disobedience to him , and your transgression ; wherefore be obedient to him , and love his ways and judgements , that he May make you more happy , with a crown immortal that never fades away ; and remember once more the Lord hath warned you , by a friend unto you in the Lord , 

E. Burrough . written the 1. day of the 7. month , called sept. 1658.  

Copies of this were delivered to divers of his children and kindred the day before he died . 

To thee , Richard Cromwell ( Called ) protector of these nations , is this moved of the Lord God of heaven and earth , to be written for thy instruction from him . 

There is a great & mighty & innumerable persons come & coming up out of Egypt's land , travelling towards the land of rest , promised of the Lord to them , to be obtained and enjoyed by them , and they do and have sojourned strangers in these nations ( Over whom thou art called to rule , and appointed chief governor ) this 7 years , and greatly are and have they been afflicted and oppressed , and even trodden down through unjust judgement and unrighteous dealing , by the rulers and inhabitants of the land ; and all the days of thy father the late protector , they were held in great captivity and bondage , and unrighteous men made them a prey , and laid heavy yokes of cruel sufferings upon them , and daily increased their task ; and something thy father did for them in their journey of great distress , yet but a little of what the Lord required of him , and what the Lord looked for that he Might have done , for power was in his hands given him of the Lord , but he was not fully obedient ; and therefore was the Lord's hand stretched out somewhat against him and his family , and he was smitten of the Lord , and suddenly taken away in judgement , for he harkened not to the counsel of the Lord concerning that persons , neither did fully relieve them from oppression , but slighted many warnings from the Lord , & the day of his visitation passed over , and death took him away in disobedience , while this persons were yet under great oppressions , for he left above a hundred of them in prisons , unjustly suffering for ••righteousness sake , and not for evil-doing ; and in this he fulfilled not the will of God , but left his name and glory somewhat stained , because of these things ; and though the Lord chose him , and showed love unto him , and gave him power over his enemies , and made him an instrument in his hand to break down great oppressions , yet he was not obedient to the end , to do my will saith the Lord , but left something undone which he was truly called unto . Now this innumerable persons that is come and coming up , as aforesaid , are them called Quakers , and this Egypt's land , is that great darkness , ignorance , and wickedness , and false ways and worships in the apostasy , and fleshly bondage to sin and death , which all the world , and kindreds , and multitudes that are unconverted to God lives and walks in ; and that land of rest promised , to which they travel , is , the peaceable and quiet dwelling with the Lord , free from the heavy oppression of sin and iniquity and cruelties of men , and free in the exercise of their pure consciences by the spirit of the Lord , as it shall move and lead them into all truth ; and their sojourning as strangers , is , their denying and despising the world , and all its glories , and walking in the daily cross of Christ , whereby they are crucified to the love , and respect , and renown and honours of the world , and are come out of kindreds , tongues and persons , Counting the reproach for Christ great riches , not respecting men , but the Lord altogether in all things , and also their suffering unrighteusly , false imprisonment , and spoiling of their goods for righteousness sake , this is their sojourning as strangers ; and that something , that thy father did for them , is , he released many of them divers times out of prisons , where they were unjustly cast , and he signified sometimes his displeasure against them that made them suffer , and showed love to them in hearing their innocent cause , with some respect thereunto ; and that which he did not , which he Might have done , is , he took not away tithes , that cause of great oppression to many , nor the unrighteous laws wholly as he ought to have done , and as the Lord required of him : 

And know thou from the Lord , that this same persons are the persons of the Lord , and beloved of him , and as dear to him , as the apple of his eye , and his presence is with them , and he leads them as a flock by his spirit into all truth , and who shall bless them shall be blessed , but he that acts against them shall not prosper , but be smitten of the Lord , for their cause will the Lord plead in his judgements , and avenge them of their enemies , and the dread of the Lord God shall fall heavy upon the heads of their persecutors , and though they are hated of all men , and are under great afflictions , yet are they a just persons , and innocent , seeking the good of all men , and are peaceable towards all , and receiving all manner of wrongs and evil , and speakings against them by ungodly men ; but they render to no man evil for evil , but bless them that curse , and do good to their enemies , and bears all things from all men in long suffering and patience for they are learned in the practices ( Of doing and suffering ) of the holy apostles and prophets , and are of the seed of Abraham , who was the friend of God , and they were thy father's friends , and are not enemies to thee , nor to righteous government , but wishes well unto thee in the Lord , and that thou May not be destroyed in wickedness , but be established in righteousness and peace in thy government , to rule in God's authority over all wicked men that May seek thy hurt ; and we desire for thee , that the Lord May give thee wisdom & a perfect understanding , and the spirit of just and sound judgement , to judge righteously in all things , and to settle the government in true judgement , that the principle of God in every man May answer to it , in defending and preserving and protecting all that walk in truth and righteousness , and being a terror to all evil-doers ; for , for that end is rule and government ordained of God amongst men , to be a praise to all that do well , and a terror to all that do evil ; and now the Lord having suffered it to be brought to pass , that thou art set up in thy father's stead to be chief ruler amongst men , this the Lord God almighty requires of thee , as thou hopes to prosper and be blessed in this life , and to enjoy life eternal when this world is passed away ; and this is the word of the Lord God unto thee , be humble , meek and lowly in heart , and exalt not thy own horn , nor seek not this world's honour , but seek the Lord with thy whole heart , and let justice and true judgement and righteous government ( Which is according to the law of God ) be set up and exalted in the nations , and come to know in thyself the dominion and authority of the Lord God over sin and transgression , and to keep down and condemn all that which is contrary to God in thy own heart , and that will make thee a dread and a terror to men and nations , and then the Lord will be thy crown , and his persons will rejoice in thee , and lift up their hearts to God for thee ; if thou throw down and abolish all unrighteous laws and decrees , which have been set up in the days of ignorance , and yet stands , wherereby the Lord's dear children are afflicted and oppressed at this day , and establish such a government which is justly according to God , in which righteousness and truth , justice and true judgement May run down , and all the contrary May be stopped and chained , and limited and confounded ; and then that which thy father left undone , the Lord will fulfil through thee , and doing these things , the Lord would make thee truly honourable and happy , and blessed in this life and in the life to come ; but in doing the contrary , the Lord will make thee a curse , and take thee away in his judgements , and thy name shall be left a reproach to ages for ever ; and if thou do rule in oppression and cruelty , and suffer the innocent to be destroyed for want of true judgement ; then shall thy days be fewer than thy fathers ; if thou be disobedient to him , the Lord shall cut thee off , and thy memorial shall rot ; and this is the word of the Lord God to thee . 

And as for this afflicted & sojourning persons , they desire nothing to thee but truth & peace & righteousness , & no more of thee but justice , justice and true judgement , and that they and their little ones , which to them are brought forth , May sojourn in peace , and quietly pass through the nations , till they come up to the land of promise , and they May not carry away of the glory , nor riches of this world with them , nor seek great places of honour from thee , nor be hurtful to thee , nor the persons , nor to mankind in their sojourning , only what the Lord commands them , that they must do , and what he forbids , that they must not do , for they have chosen the Lord to be their leader , and to give him their obedience in all things , and thy government so far as it is according to God , they will not destroy nor rebel against , but are true friends thereunto , & subject in all things ; and if thou walk with the Lord , and choose him for thy counsellor , and abase thyself , and altogether exalt him , and preserve his persons that fear him , then shalt thou prosper , and thy name shall be greater than was thy fathers & the numberless number of this ( Now ) distressed persons will be unto thee a strength , and stand by thee in thy day of trouble , and defend thee and thy just government , and their hearts shall cleave to thee , and thou shalt prosper for their sakes , and none of thy enemies shall shall have power over thee to destroy thee , though many May seek for thy life ; wherefore my friend awake , awake , and now consider the day of thy visitation is present , and thy fathers is past , and now thou hast a time to gain unto thyself everlasting honour and renown , or otherwise to leave thy name a curse and a reproach for evermore ; do thou hearken to the voice of the Lord , and fear his dreadful name , and bow before our god that made heaven and earth , who rules in the kingdoms of men , and pulleth down one , and setteth up another at his pleasure , and as he will , and he will make thee know that he lives and reigns over all , and doth whatsoever he will , and if he smite thee , none shall heal thee , and if he wound thee , none shall comfort thee ; therefore take him for thy counsellor , and beware of the wicked counsels of men , for thou hast many enemies , and they would rejoice to see thy fall , and if the Lord be not on thy side , thou cannot long stand , but if thou be obedient to him , and preserve his persons , and break down all oppression , than thy enemies shall fall , and thy foot shall tread them down , and the terror of the Lord shall be upon all that hate thee ; but thus shall it be done unto thee , if thou be disobedient to him , and reject his counsel by his servant . 

I am thy friend , and a lover of thy soul , and seeks thy happiness in this world , and in the world to come , known to many by of the name of Edward Burrough .

To Richard Cromwell , protector ( So called . ) 

Friend , 

Thou being chief magistrate of these nations , and dominions belonging thereunto , carry thyself wisely in the fear of God , and take heed of being lifted up , but be low , and grave and temperate , than thou wilt foresee dangers that would happen to thee , and come upon thee , and not a plot or act against thee , but wisdom foresees ; live in that ; mind the humility of Moses , the meekness of Moses , and the humility that Solomon the King speaks of , who says , that before honour was the humility , prov. 15.  And keep on thy own legs , in the power and strength of the Lord , waiting for his wisdom from above , by which all things were made and create , with which wisdom thou Mayest be ordered to God's glory , and all thou hast under thy hand to his glory , that with it thou Mayst feel the blessing of the Lord God of glory and life with thee , whereby thou Mayst come to see the law of God , and counsel and wisdom and strength from him , and understanding and knowledge , that with the law of God received of him , thou Mayst come to answer the principle of God in every man , which law of God , the higher power , goes over all transgressors , and with that order the creation , which will let thee see as it did Moses that meek man , before any transgression was , the first transgression upon the earth ; this law the higher power to which the soul must be subject , the which is a terror to the evil-doers , a praise to them that do well , is higher than all the transgressors & evil-doers upon the earth , and a terror to them that do evil , which law and higher power answers the principle of God in every one that do evil , which goes from that of God in them . Now this is for the praise of them that do well , for them that do well are led by the spirit of God , and such lives in the power , and this law was not made for the righteous , but for sinners and transgressors ; now there is no sinner nor transgressor upon the earth , but first goes from the principle of God in his own particular , than he goes out of the fear of God , and loses his wisdom and counsel , and such will turn the sword backward against the righteous , which the law was not made for , and by such hath all the righteous upon earth suffered , and such hath been all the persecutors upon the earth from the foundation of the world , that is first gone from the principle of God in their own selves , and have been in authority , they have persecuted the just , and turned it against the just , and made a prey of such as reproves in the gate ; yea , they that departs from sin and evil , comes to be their scorn , and these were they that made men offenders for a word , and compelled others to do such things which they could not , but sin against their own consciences , and against the Lord , and such the Lord soon cut down , and cut off , and swept away ; and often when things are young , they are tender , but when they grow up into prosperity , they grow wanton , and forget the Lord ; therefore friend , live in God's wisdom , if thou wilt reign in his power and strength , than none shall touch thee , and all them that fear God , will be on thy side , and take thy part , and be one with thee in all thy sufferings , yea , till death . 

And friend , let no wild raw flatterers that will be lifted up by gifts , rewards or high places bear any offices , for such to thee will be a burden at last , and will clog thee , and flatter thee for their own ends ; shake off such spirits from thee , and let no judges or justices or priest be authorised that will persecute men for religion , for such are not in the mind of Christ not the apostles , for they wrestled not with flesh and blood , nor watered with it , but with the principalities and powers and rulers of darkness , and spiritual wickedness in high places , eph. 6. 2. that they struck down , which caused the enmity amongst persons , and they did not strike at the creatures , nor wrestle with them with flesh and blood , with such they did not war withal concerning religion ; and Christ , when they would have had fire come down from heaven to consume them that opposed him and them , Christ rebuked them , and told them , they knew not what spirit they were of , and he said , he did not come to destroy men's lives , but to save them ; so all judges and justices and priests , that will have men's lives destroyed , and war with flesh and blood , and wrestle with that about religion , they are not of the mind of Christ and his apostles the true ministers , for abundance of prisonment to death and bloodshed hath been in these nations , by the blind zeal of magistrates , judges , justices & priests ; therefore that 's the cause the Lord hath turned them upside down , that they stand not long , because they fight against the righteous and the just , and wrestle with creatures , and flesh and blood , such are not worthy to have the names of magistrates nor teachers , as thou Mayst read . And friend , take heed of letting any gaoler bear office that 's a drunkard , profane swearers , as many of them is , or letting persons lie long in goals , twenty or thirty together , for such they learn badness together one of another , and gaolers be bad examples to them , that they are worse when they come out , then when they went in . 

And friend , take heed of letting any judges exact upon the persons in the poor countries where they come , and their courts by tricks , but keep them all to so saying and so doing , not saying one thing and doing another , for they have made many persons come up to them 200 miles , and when they have come , they have said , they do not mean as they speak , and this be their tricks , as by their writs they must appear personally , and then when they come , they must appear by attorneys or counsellors , when the poor man knows his cause well enough himself . 

And friend , take heed of holding up the priests , and them called ministers , and giving them means and maintenance , for which they do not work , least in thy name they sue the persons , and cast in prison till the death , and so make thy name to become a cloak for their persecution ; for who sets them on work let them pay them their wages , and whom they work for , let them give them their meat , and that will be like the ministers of the gospel ; and now thou being free of these things , keep thyself so . 

And friend , here is a great talk of religion and ministry , and profession and Christianity , but if thou did but feel that which we feel and see , it would grieve thy heart , so much pride and haughtiness , and loftiness amongst persons , and hard heartedness , that there is so many beggars , cripples , blind , lame men and women and children on their knees , women lying with children in their laps up and down every corner , in the streets and high ways and steeple , house doors , throughout this great rich city , that never knew want , and do not know many of them what to eat and drink and put on ; now if these things enter into thy ears , and tenderness strike thee , and thou consider , thou wilt feel it . 

Now there hath been a cry of the Jews hardheartedness , that turned against Christ ; now friend consider , the Jews that took tithes had a storehouse to put it in , and the tenths were enough for to relieve the strangers , fatherless and widows , that there need not be a beggar amongst them ; now i say , the tithes of this nation would give strangers , fatherless and widows and priests enough both , if they had storehouses to put it in , that there need not be a beggar amongst them , as there was not amongst the Jews , but than you must own Christ is not come in the flesh ; for these tithes were set up since the days of the apostles , for they preached them not up , but down , as heb. 7. but they have been preached up since the apostasy , when all the want hath been , and before the apostasy among the true Christians ▪ there was no want among them , every one had for his necessity ; now look amongst all the magistrates and ministry hear , and see how things are out of order , though there should be never such true laws given forth , yet putting them into such corrupt magistrates hands ; they will never act them , but wrest them and pervert them and turn them against the righteous , and by that the just suffers . 

And friend , let none bear the office of judge , sheriff , justice or minister , that 's heady , perverse and peevish , for such often slay themselves by their envy , and it eats out the good in them , and they will be a burden to thee and a grief both , thou living in the power and wisdom of God , the simplicity in thee will be burdened as it is in us , and thou dealing in truth , it will stand by thee , and answer the principle of God in every man ; for such causes many poor men to go away with sorrow and grief . 

And let no man bear office , whatsoever his office May be , that would have honour before he have humility , for such will more mind honours below , earthly , and favours of men , than justice , and are out of Solomon's steps , who said , before honour is humility . 

And friend , take heed of giving titles to men , nor do not learn to do it , but mind Elihu that young man's counsel that spoke to Job that great rich man the judge , who said , if i give titles to man , which he had not learned to give titles to men , his maker would soon take him away , as thou May est read Job 3d. and the last . 

And friend , it is a just thing for thee to make all those ministers that have cast into prison abundance of the servants of the Lord God , because they could not put into their mouths that for which they did not work for , nor never hired , and yet like ravenous wolves cast them into prison , for bidding them repent and fear God , and lay away their pride and their rings points , and superfluities , and tell them of their costly apparel , wearing gold rings and costly apparel , as said the apostle , it was not the wearing of gold or costly apparel , and such it May be for speaking to them have been cast into prison , and for telling them they be out of the doctrine of Christ ; now to make all these put them out of prison again and all those justices likewise as have cast friends in prison for biding persons fear God ; it May be moved of God to cry repentance through a town , or reprove sin in the gate , they cast them into prison as sturdy beggars , though men or women of sufficient estates ; now this gives an evil savour , now to make them put them out again , that will be for the convincing of persons , and be a sweet savour , and the bringing and showing the wisdom of the Lord God to thee . 

And friend , take heed of having any to compel another to maintain his meeting house , or his clerk to say amen , but that every one maintain his own meeting house , and if he will have a clerk to say amen , let him pay him his wages , and every one if he will have a minister , to maintain his minister , for there 's many thousands in the nations that they need not to say unto them know the Lord , that hath the law of the Lord written in their hearts , and put in their minds , and are come under his government , and knows Christ to be their teacher , and hears him , as God said , this is my beloved son hear ye him , and the apostle said to the Hebrews , God spoke to our fathers by the prophets and visions , but now in these last days he hath spoken to us by his son , whom he hath made heir of all things , and upholdeth all things by the word of his power . 

And friend , let no drunkard nor swearer or profane man keep inns , taverns or alehouses ; but such as fears God , whose houses are wholesome to lodge travellers , that no young nor old persons May be nursed up in such idle places to act wickedness , and to keep games and sports , and things to play in their houses on purpose for persons to spend and pass away their time in vanity , now this is an ill savour to a Christian life , and which is common in the nations . 

And friend , let none that is called a minister that comes and creeps under thee for maintenance , tithes , and augmentations , let him first go plant , and plough , and thresh , and get a flock , and then let him reap and eat , for that is the apostles counsel , take it to thy side ; and then thou wilt not be cumbered with ministers , than thou wilt come to know the public service that belongs to thy place , which is to do justice . 

And friend , let no officer whatsoever that is covetous after gifts or sums of money , rewards or bribes , let no man that is such bear office ; for the gifts , rewards and bribes blinds his eye , and make him he cannot do justice , for because of such the helpless is not helped , and the jaws of the wicked is not broken , and for that cause the Lord brings judgement upon a land ; and men are blinded with earthly honours , gifts , rewards and high places , and puffed up with honours , and do not see it how the Lord brings judgement upon them and overturns them with his hand , & yet they take not notice who are crying peace , peace , but sudden destruction comes upon them ; so thy time is now , consider as thou stands in the wisdom of God , and lives in his fear , counsel and dread , and feels his hand and arm , and stands in his wisdom and power , thou wilt prosper and reign , but if any earthly honour blind thee , the Lord will come upon thee when thou dost not see it , and turn thee into the earth , which the earthly honour comes to , and where God lays it down in the dust ; but whose honour is from him that 's from above , and hath his wisdom and power by which he made all the creatures , they shall reign with the Lord God in his power , strength and arm . 

And friend , take heed how thou let any perverse , peevish , cross , malicious justice or magistrate whatsoever bear any office , that will not do justice except they have earthly honour , but are in strife and peevish against them that cannot give it them , such magistrates have left the counsel of Solomon ; but its honour for men to do justice , and it will be an honour for thee to do justice , and see that justice be done , and the greatest comfort in the world to thee , in that thou wilt have peace with God everlastingly , and happiness for ever , and his blessing , and know a world that hath no end ; so the Lord God almighty preserve thee in his wisdom , counsel and strength over the heads of his enemies in thyself , and in the world both , that thou Mayst come to live in that which comprehends the world , which was before the world was made , in that , and with that thou Mayst come to order the creatures , by which wisdom of God they was made and create to his glory ; and friend take heed of putting of honest , godly men out of the army , or putting them out of place , being justices , and such as fears God , in so doing thou wilt blame thyself , and weaken thy authority , and remove thyself out of the hearts of them that fears God . 

From a lover of thy soul and thy eternal good and establishing of righteousness . G. f.  

From the church of Christ and elect assembly , called of the Lord and gathered by his spirit , and redeemed by his power from amongst men , & out of all the many false sects upon earth into fellowship with the father , and with the son , to follow the lamb whithersoever he goes , and we are named in scorn , and known in the nations by the name of Quakers . 

To thee Richard Cromwell chosen to be protector , and chief magistrate governor of these nations of England Scotland , and Ireland , a faithful presentation and salutation by a servant of the church . 

We are rightly and truly sensible in all things of the mighty hand of the Lord God who brings all things to pass by his own power , and according to his will , and in heaven and earth , and over the kingdoms of men he ruleth and reigneth , he buildeth and breaketh down , and planteth and plucketh up , and he pulleth down one and setteth up another , and who May say what dost thou ? or why dost thou it ? for he is a great God and a mighty , and his majesty is terrible , and all things in heaven and earth , and all the sons of men , are at his disposure , whose dominion is from everlasting to everlasting , and he May be feared and had in reverence by all creatures that hath life and breath . 

And in particular we are sensible of his great and mighty power , who hath of late years in these nations once and again overturned and overthrowed and changed at his pleasure , times , and powers and authorities , and dominions , and he hath brought down the mighty from their seats , and stained the crowns and glories of the honourable , and broken the stouthearted , and the oppressors and their governments , as potsherds one against another , and made the highest of men of no respect before him ; for he hath pulled down and set up whom he would according to his will , and in all these things hath his hand been , the very doer and accomplisher thereof , that he Might be known and feared amongst all persons through the whole earth , who is the dread and terror of men and nations . 

And as for thy father the late protector , great things and honourable did the Lord do for him , in raising him up and casting out his enemies before him ; and giving him victory and power and renown through nations ; and we know the Lord showed favour to him , and gave him strength , wisdom , and valour , and a right spirit ; and he was called of God into that great work , to subdue the grievous tyrannies once ruling over tender consciences , and to break down the great oppressions which for ages had caused the just to groan , and the Lord was with him in victory and went before him , and was his defence and preserved him from great dangers , and from the wills of all his enemies , and made him prosperous against them all ; but yet we know ( To say no more of him ) he did not wholly fulfil the will of the Lord , nor ▪ the work which he begun , but became disobedient , and abused his great deliverances and authority , and did not set free the oppressed altogether , but left mountains of oppressions , and grievous yokes of bondage unbroken down , and unsubdued ; and the Lord smote him and took him away in judgement because thereof . 

And as for thee , who art now set up in his stead , we certainly believe that the hand of the Lord is in this matter , if but to try thee , and it is he that hath brought it to pass , not expected by any , nor much sought after by thyself ; but it 's come to pass , a thing out of and contrary to the thoughts and expectations of the whole nations art thou attained to this place of government ; & therefore we must acknowledge something of the great hand of God in it , being come to pass as out of due season , yet May the Lord make it seasonable , and we patiently wait to receive what the Lord brings to pass thereby , knowing that thou art in the hand of the Lord to do whatsoever he will with thee and concerning thee ; and if thou fear him and walk with him , and choose him for thy counsellor , and be obedient to him , and seek his glory alone , and not thy own honour and greatness , than the Lord will do great things for thee , and by thee , and accomplish his own work through thee , which fell in thy father hand , and thou wilt be blessed and renowned and honoured for ever , and thy name shall be had in respect in generations to come , and hereby the present thoughts of many shall be confounded ; but if thou do harden thy heart against God , & live carelessly , and neglect his cause , and despise his name and honour , & seek thy own renown , and oppress the just in thee , and without thee , and suffer the poor to groan under the cruelty and burden of oppressing men and laws in thy government , without relief from thee , and go on in usurped authority , as some evil men before thee , then shalt thou not prosper , but the Lord shall bring thee down , and lay his hand of judgement upon thee , and thy name shall be a reproach to the saints for ever , and the heavy hand of vengeance shall be upon thee , and pursue thee more than any before thee , and the Lord will deliver his persons by another way ; and this is not in flattery and fainedness to thee , but as the Lord lives , our god shall bring it to pass in his day , and thou shalt be the witness . 

Wherefore oh man , seek the face of the Lord , and inquire diligently of him , and hear his word that thy soul May live , and feel a measure of his spirit in thee to lead thee into all truth , and set his presence before thy eye always to direct thy steps , that he May bless thee with power , wisdom , authority and dominion , to perform the duty of thy place faithfully towards the Lord and all men , as he requires of thee ; and if thou first seek the kingdom of God and its righteousness , and the reconciliation between the Lord and thee , and come to feel the elect seed of God raised up over all the contrary in thee , and transgression , and thy own will and affections , and that which is of the flesh in thee judged and condemned by the word in the heart , which makes the immortal soul to live and be refreshed in God , and the heir of the promise of God born in thee , and hereby shalt thou have an assurance and hope of life eternal , to rest in perfect peace with God , when this world is no more , but passed away with thee , and also in this present time , wisdom and valour , and true nobility shall be added to thee , and the spirit of power and dominion to make men and nations be afraid and fear , and all evil men , and such as seeks the hurt of thee and thy government , shall be blasted and confounded , and all good men be encouraged and made strong , and the whole nations kept in peace and unity , and the truth and peace of God shall hereby flourish amongst us , to the honour of the eternal God , and to thy renown , if thou rule and govern for him , and by his spirit and authority . 

And we are truly sensible of the great charge of this place , & also of the multitude of perplexities and dangers to thyself occurring and happening thereby , dangers from open enemies by their malice and cruel plots , and dangers from thy pretended friends , and they of thy own house by secret surmisings , dangers in martial and civil affairs in this nation and abroad , so that we certainly , believe nothing save only the wisdom of God and his power can preserve thee & carry thee to go through , & faithfully fulfil so great a place , and to discharge it truly in the sight of God and just men , neither Mayst thou be defended and preserved by any other means , from the wills and plots and envy of evil men , who May watch for evil against thee , to destroy thee and blot out thy name , and thy father's posterity out of the land ; wherefore take heed to thyself , and fear God , that he May bless thee , for this is a subtle and crafty generation , and the nations are politic , and the inhabitants thereof wise and deceitful over whom thou art set , and with whom thou hast to deal ; therefore beware of men , for many May seek after thy hurt , and some May flatter thee , and show seeming great respect unto thee , and profess great service of love to thee in the nations and in thy family for a season , till their own ends of advantage be accomplished , and May in the very time hatch evil against thee , and secretly invent to uncover thy nakedness and betray thee , for many men are treacherous ; but thou receiving a measure of the wisdom of God , it will guide thee over all such , and thou wilt see into the hearts and spirits of men , and to discern between love unfeigned , which will seek thy good & not self , & that love which is feigned , which will flatter thee and blind thy judgement , and lead thee into snares , and such as will the least flatter thee , will be the most true to thee ; so beware , and let not vain flatterers , and proud ambitious and ungodly , self-seeking men , nor drunkards , nor covetous , nor politic and deceitful men and spirits have any place in thy heart , nor in thy house , nor in places of authority and trust in thy government , for such men will be a snare unto thee , and a dishonour to thee , and the cause of God's wrath & curse against thy person , family and whole nations , for such men God will not bless , nor thee nor the government for their sakes , & this thou wilt find true one day ; therefore choose unto thee such men as fears God , who are just and humble , and upright-hearted , who are sincere and faithful to the Lord , who hath the wisdom of God , and true nobility of spirit , in righteousness and simplicity , free from the profaneness of this evil world , let such be thy companions to wait upon thy person , and to govern and rule in thy family and nations , and let such be put in trust , who will not be treacherous , for such are blessed , and will be a blessing to thee and the whole government , and we know that the Lord gives respect and regard to the upright that fears his name , and such he will accomplish his work by , to thy renown , and the peace and happiness of the nations , more than to craft and policy , and the wisdom and subtlety of this world , for thereby the Lord will never fulfil his work , nor prosper a ruler nor his persons ; and if thy strength and defence be there , and not in the Lord and his pure wisdom only , thou canst not prosper , but the nations & men will overreach thee , & beguile thee , and thou cannot be happy , nor thy government be kept in peace , but a little measure of the fear & power and wisdom of the Lord God from heaven in thy heart , & amongst such as are thy counsellors , to guide you & govern you , will be of more value and worth unto thee in thy place and condition , than all worldly policy and wisdom and craft , which with God is not regarded , nor of him ever blessed ; and if thou deny the Lord and righteous men , and choose thy own way and this world's wisdom that 's from below , than thy trust and strength shall pierce thee and make thee feeble , and of all others thy state will be the most miserable , if thou be given into the policy and deceits of treacherous men ; so be wise and seek the Lord , that he May be thy trust , and put not confidence in vain man , whose heart is deceitful , and desperately wicked . 

And as concerning the condition of these nations , they are in a broken state , much divided and divers in judgements , and far out of good order , for there is much corruption and abuse in all orders and places of men , and much to be purged out and judged , both in magistracy and ministry , before righteousness , peace and truth , union , joy and faithfulness , can embrace one another amongst the inhabitants of the nations , for both are in a diversion & degeneration from what they were at the first ordained of God , and this i could clearly manifest unto thee , for the nations are but newly come out of popery , having put off but part of the dress of that polluted whore , and the garments of professions in religion , yet smell thereof , as not being thoroughly purged from her abominable idolatries and superstitions , as thou Mayst see when the Lord opens thy eye , to view the present state of all things . 

As for magistracy , it was ordained of God to be a dread and terror , & limit to all evil-doers , & to be a defence & praise to all that do well , to condemn the guilty , & to justify the guiltless ; but the exercise thereof at this day inthese nations is degenerated , and some that are in authority are greatly corrupted , and regards not the just and pure law of God to judge only thereby , but oppresseth the poor by injustice , and subverts the good laws of God and men to a wrong end and use , abusing authority , and turning the sword against the just , whereby true judgement is turned backward , & the innocent made unjustly to suffer for righteousness sake , through the corruption of men in authority , and didst thou but know what we know in this particular , it would pierce thy heart ; why ? It is frequent amongst some of the judges & magistrates to commit a just man to prison , & impose some great fine up on him , and to cast him into a dungeon or hole among thieves and murderers for a long season , for no other offence or breach of any law , but because he cannot put off his hat to them , and respect their persons by bowing the hat or knee ; and many others that fears God , and for conscience sake cannot swear upon a book by kissing it & laying hand upon it , because Christ saith , swear not at all , though they deny not to do and speak the truth in all things , as in the presence of God and all men ; and many others , that because they are moved to cry against sin , and declare against the iniquities of the times in teachers , rulers and persons , that highly abounds , perhaps in a market , or steeplehouse , or highway , or other place , as they are moved of God ; and many others because for conscience sake they cannot pay tithes nor give money and wages to a maintain a priest , or false teacher that they receive no profit by , or to maintain a steeplehouse , where the world worships in vain traditions , and not in the spirit and power of God ; and many have been taken out of peaceable meetings where they were waiting upon the Lord , and some out of their inns , and friends houses , and many have been taken on the way , travelling about their lawful occasions , and some from their callings , and labours , and for these causes , through the envy of wicked men , and without any just conviction of the breach of any law , or any lawful trial , or examination , have hundred of just men being wholly innocent , been sent to prison and laid many months , and some for years , or whipped , and put in the stocks , and grievously abused by cruel executioners of wicked men's envy and injustice , and upon such grounds only , and for such causes mentioned , and without the transgression of any just law have and do at this day many hundred of faithful subjects suffer hard and cruel things , long and sore imprisonment , and cruel and sharp whipping , and stocking , and unjust banishment out of towns and cities , yea , friends its hard to be expressed and large to be declared how many of the Lord's servants , do and have suffered great injustice in these nations , through the abuse of good government , and degeneration of magistracy from its perfect state and place whereunto it was ordained of God in the beginning ; and moreover , great have been the abuses , by striking , and beating and halling , and kickings , and revilings , and reproaching , whereby many have suffered unrighteously , and not relieved nor defended by such in authority as ought to have done it , neither the evil doers at all corrected and punished as aught to have been , though known to men in power , and thus it is happened to us in our age , well doers are punished as transgressors , and evil doers go free , and thus its manifest , magistracy and government , rulers and laws are greatly degenerated and subverted from what they ought to be according as the Lord ordained them ; for all this May be proved particularly , so that the nations are out of good order , and the state of government and rule degenerated , and men in authority and places of trust corrupted , not being in their own hearts ruled by the spirit of the Lord , and therefore they cannot rule for him among men , justly , and righteously , as the Lord requires ; and also so great hath been the degeneration in government in these nations of late years , that many faithful and just men that have been in great places of trust , both in martial and civil affairs , through the envy , and evil surmising of others , have been turned out of all place and power , and not suffered to give their judgement amongst men , but been cast off as unprofitable , though no evil could be charged against them , whereby the Lord hath been offended ; but all things and places of men must be new moulded and corrected , and purged , and regenerated , that true judgement May flourish , and righteousness and truth prosper , as in the beginning , and this will the Lord suddenly bring to pass by his own power ; and if thou oppose it , thou shalt not prosper , but be cut off , and taken out of the way ; for the spirit of the Lord hath been provoked to wrath because of these things , and his anger is kindled against the nations , and he hath overthrown and will once more overthrow till he come whose right it is to rule , whose shall be the government and kingdoms , and all his enemies shall be slain . 

And as for the public ministry as now it is in its present estate , we certainly know and testify from the Lord unto thee , and to the whole nations , that it is not the same ministry of Christ which the apostles had , nor by the same power and spirit , but is wholly degenerated , in call , in practice , and in maintenance , and in all things from what the ministry of Christ was in the days of the true churches , before the apostasy ; and it is as now it stands in degeneration , not of God , nor in the power and spirit of Christ Jesus , nor hath it the same end and effects as the ministry of Christ once had , but it 's tasted , and tainted with the spirit of Antichrist , which long hath ruled in the world , and it 's become a grievous oppression in the nations , and persons are not converted nor turned to God from their evil ways , but remains unprofited ; and to say no more of it , though much i Might say , what i affirm of it i May prove by the scriptures against the wisest of them before thee if thou please , viz. that as now the ministry stands , it is not perfectly the same ministry the apostles had , but is degenerated from what the ministry of Christ was in the days of the apostles , and true churches , before the apostasy , and if ever God touch thy heart thou wilt see it so , when the spirit of Christ is chief judge in thee , thou wilt witness this to be true ; and then May not thy power uphold any thing which is contrary to God , when government is purged and made pure from all its present degeneration . 

Again , there are many and divers sorts of sects , and gatherings of persons , and professions in religion of several contrary judgements and opinions , and worships in these nations , and these persons over whom thou art set to rule are divers , and divided in their ways and minds , and professions of religion , some looking for , and seeking after Christ , in such a manner , and others after another manner , all crying lo here is Christ , and thus he will come , and lo he is there , and so will he appear , and some are inventing , and supposing such a government the best , and others contrary to that , and many are ( As ) distracted in their thoughts , not knowing what to seek , or what to look after ; some are for such a government , and religion , and others for another , and peradventure each one of all these May seek to thee for protection against such as opposeth them , commending and justifying their own way , and sect , and form , and religion , against all others , and craving laws to maintain themselves , and their sect , and to stop and limit all other ways as heresy , because differing from them , and they will each of them turn and wrest the scriptures , from the mind of the spirit that gave them forth , to prove their own opinions and professions to be right against all others , but now thou Mayst know that the scriptures were given forth by the one spirit of God , and is the testimony of one truth , of one favour , of one true worship , and one only true religion , and not many , and divers ways , and them that are of divers judgements and worships , and religions , and yet all pleads proof from the scriptures for what they profess and practice ; all such perverts the scriptures , and wrists them , who are thus divided and unsettled in religion , and they show that none of them hath the spirit that gave forth the scriptures , which spirit leads into all truth , and in it is the true worship of God , and the true profession and practice of true religion , and that spirit only understands its own words in scripture , but all these divers sects and heaps of persons that are divided in worship , and about religion , hath not the spirit of God that gave forth scriptures to lead them into all truth ▪ and guide them in the perfect way and pure religion which the apostles and churches of Christ were in in their days ; but all these many sects that are thus divided are risen up since the days of the apostles , and are of another spirit , and of a false religion ; and as for such called ministers , they will be hurrying about thee , and flattering thee with fair and crafty words , and smooth petitions , and requests for protection and establishment from thee , and for large maintenance , and stipends and tithes ; and possibly they May complain to thee against such as cannot give them hire , and tithes , but May reprove their evil and covetousness , and wickedness , begging for laws against such , and crying out against error and heresy , because some May be moved to cry against their deceits and oppressions , and for the like causes they will run about thee , and sec their own advantage , and this we know their nature and spirit is such ; and hath been for many ages . 

But now friend , do thou stand in God's authority , out of , and over all such teachers and sects , and come not under any of them that have the form of godliness but want the power , who are in the apostasy , from the life and pure religion that the apostles were in , nor believe them not that shall say , lo Christ is here , or lo he is there ; or who shall ascend to fetch him from without , or when shall he come from far to save his persons ? go not thou after any of all these , but hearken to the word of God in thy heart , and know that Christ is within thee , else thou art reprobate , neither do thou take in hand to exalt any one of these sects , or some of them above others , neither defend and maintain any of them against others of them , nor tolerate not one of them above another , for if thou do , it will betray thee and the nations peace , and set all spirits on fire about thee , and while one is pleased and May pray for thee , others will be vexed against thee and curse thee ; wherefore be not troubled about these things , nor cumber not thyself about religion how to establish it for it is in God's hand only to establish his worship and religion , it belongs to him , as he will , and not as man by his policy and wisdom ; but stand free from them all , and neither establish any , nor persecute any sect whatsoever , but let them all have their course and season , they will fall and perish of themselves , and the good old way , and truth , and the pure religion only will remain , and let them cry one against another , ; and rebuke one another , and meddle not thou with that , but only let thy laws and authority preserve men's persons and estates , from the wrong one of another , that all men May live peaceably under thee , and no man wrong his neighbour's person or estate ; and that 's only thy place to rule in outward affairs , but not to rule over any man's conscience , to compel him to such a worship , or to limit from such a worship in religion , that belongs not to thee , but to the Lord , who alone will be the ruler and guide and exerciser of his people's consciences , and if thou do meddle therein , thou shalt not prosper , nor be blessed in thy deed ; so leave the establishing of religion to the Lord , and let all these sects manifest if any of them have the spirit & power of God in them , & with them , & let them show their weapons of the spirit , for only such as hath the power and spirit of God in them will overcome , and such will be increased and grow , and thou nor none can hinder , and such that wants the power and spirit of God , in and with them , May flourish in their form for a while , but they will be blasted and wither , and it is vain for thee or any to uphold such , or endeavour to establish them , but if thou meddle on these accounts , it will undo thee , and confound thee ; therefore be wise , and know what the Lord requires of thee perfectly , for if thou leave that undone which God requires , then shalt thou be condemned , and if thou do that which he requires not , then shalt thou not be free ; and this is written in love to thee , to inform thy mind , how to walk towards the Lord , and the persons over whom he hath set thee ; and as for the maintaining of ministers , let that alove also , and be not troubled about it , for it was ever the false prophets and deceivers that preached for hire , and went after gifts and rewards , and sought money and gifts of persons , and they that do the same now were never sent of God , nor are they such as shall convert persons to God ; for who are true ministers of Christ , will not seek to thee nor to men for wages , and tithes , and money , but live of the gospel , and not compel great sums of money from persons to maintain them in their families in pride , in fullness and idleness , such things are great oppressions in this nation , and a horrible filthy thing in the sight of God , and because thereof will the Lord's judgements come upon the land ; if thou were but rightly sensible what casting into goals , and what suing at law of poor persons , and what spoiling people's goods by destraint , and all for and about tithes and priests wages , it would make thee admire the wickedness of that generation ; but do thou let them alone , for they do shame themselves , and undo themselves , and loose the hearts of all good persons by their own doings , and stand over them all in God's authority , and know a measure of the spirit of God in thy own heart , and thereby thou wilt discern and try and judge of the spirits of all men , and their religion , and the spirit will lead thee in the pure religion , to worship God in spirit and in truth , so let not thy mind be cumbered at all about establishing religion , nor about maintaining the ministers , but be faithful to what the Lord requires of thee , and learn his will , and do it , and then thou wilt be blessed and honoured in this world , & in the world to come . 

And friend , know thou that the Lord is doing of a great work in these nations , he is raising up a seed to serve him and to worship him aright , and the god of heaven is setting up a kingdom over the kingdoms of the world , and he hath a controversy with all sorts of persons , in as much as corruption and degeneration is entered amongst all , and all must be purged of all orders of men , and the evil cast out , the work of the Lord is great and mighty , and he requires no help from thee , nor any man whatsoever , for his own arm will bring it to pass , yet he would not have thee to gainsay his work , and strive against it , and seek to quench what the Lord is bringing forth , if thou do it , then shalt thou be condemned , and the Lord will speedily execute his judgements , and remove thee , and overthrow thy power and authority into destruction ; wherefore be passive in this matter , and look thou at the Lord , and protect and descend men's persons and estates from wrong , but meddle not with their opinions and professions in religions , to exalt any of them , nor yet to persecute them ; and as concerning the armies abroad , let faithful and just men that will not seek themselves be put in trust , for the army is of great concernment to thee , to stand or fall through them as to man's account , and the war against Spain be faithful to God in it , and let trusty men have authority , the Lord May accomplish something by it to his honour and to thine , if thou be meek and humble , and walk with the Lord ; and to say no more about it , there is something in it known to the Lord , and he May bring it to pass in his season . 

And thus friend , according as it lay upon me from the Lord , i have written this unto thee in dear and pure love , God is witness , and i have cleared my conscience to thee thus far , and if thou fall by thy own transgression , it will lie upon thyself , i have warned thee , and i am clear ; and if thy fall comes , remember thou wast advised .
