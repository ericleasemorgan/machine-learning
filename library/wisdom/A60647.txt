The Day of Restoration's come ; 
the Lamb , the Life , the Holy One , 
He is Establishing his Name : 
Nations must bow unto the same . 
The Heavens are old , the Earth is dry , 
The Glory of Man must fall and die ; 
His Leaf decays , his Blossom fades away ; 
He withers in the Night , and burns up in the Day . 
The Fire will try his Root , and prove his fairest Branch ; 
And Root and Branch must burn , and none shall stop or quench : 
The Old must pass away , and vanish out of sight ; 
The New must he set up , and shine in Glory bright . 
Blessed is the Day .

TO THE READER 

READER , 

Whether thou art a Friend unto Truth , on an Enemy ; or whether thou art a Professor or Profane , a Cedar or an Oak , a flying Bird , or a ranting Spirit , This following Truth , which in this Book is declared , may be of service unto thee , if thou wilt but read it ●eekly and soberly ; for it is given forth from that Innocent Life that the Serpent did ever make war against ; and for the Innocents' sake it is sent abroad , that the harmless Lambs may be preserved , and also delivered out of the Net of the wicked Fowler , and from the Snares of his Dark Devices : Therefore when thou enterest upon it , and undertakest to read it , do it in the dread and fear of the Lord God , and sink into the lowness , and feel Gods Witness in thy own Conscience , that thou mayest read , and also understand ; for it is God's loving kindness unto thee , into whose hands it may be ordered to be read or heard , and from the tenderness of Love it is declared , and also sent abroad , that thou ( whoever thou art ) mayest reap some profit by it ; which thou wilt do , if thou readest it in that good Spirit which is given unto thee to profit withal , and unto which the truth of it is made manifest , and keepest down that evil spirit , against which it testifieth ; and as thou keepest to the Spirits manifestation in thyself , and in that readest it , thou wilt feel when thy Condition is reached , and when it is spoken unto ; and as it openeth unto thy Understanding , put it not away from thee , but keep quiet and be still , and let not Anger nor Envy arise in thy heart , which the Serpent sometimes will provoke thee to ; and if thou givest way unto it , and sufferest it to arise , it will prevent thee for profiting , though thou mayest read what is in this Book contained ; but as thou readest it in the Meekness , and receivest it in the Love , from which it is declared , and for thy Good truly intended , than thou wilt feel the weight of it , and reap advantage and profit by it : and a● thou readest , consider what thou canst witness of these things in thyself that therein is declared , and in so reading or hearing thou wilt profit , and Gods Witness in thy Conscience will awaken thee , and truly prove unto thee what thy present state and condition is ; and though never a Scripture-text be quoted for the proof of the Testimony , yet thou shalt find a proof in thee , which if thou mindest it , will not deceive thee , but will open thy own Condition to thee , which will be better for thee than many Proofs without thee , and in that thou wilt feel how far thou art come to witness Redemption by the Power of Christ , or where it is the Serpent holdeth thee , and what thou art yet in bondage to ; and , as in the Light thou seest it , then turn to the Light , and deny it , that whatever it is , it may be judged , and upon the Cross crucified , and in the Fire consumed ; for through this Gate thou must come , or out of Paradise thou art excluded , and from the Tree of Life for ever fenced : and I having seen , and also observed how the World lieth in wickedness , and also , how many there be that profess Godliness , which when I consider and see how few are regenerated and born again , I am even filled with grief and sorrow ; Therefore in true tenderness , and love , and bowels of pity unto all , the precious Truth is declared as it is in Jesus ; and also the secret workings of the Serpent , that hath always been a Deceiver : And thou mayest in this Book behold things past , things present , and things to come , whereby thou mayst understand the love that God hath unto thee ; and do thou yield unto the Lord , that his Work thou mayest know , who will judge thy Lust , crucify thy Life , and destroy the body of Sin , and so through Death , bring forth a new Life , in which thou wilt feel a perfect Change wrought , from the earthly into the heavenly , where thou wilt enjoy the Lord and his Presence , his Power and his Goodness , and sit quietly in Joy , and Peace and Blessing :

CHAP. I The State of Man in the Creation . 

The Lord God of Life and Power , who is from Everlasting to Everlasting , according to the good pleasure of his own Will , and after the Counsel of his own Heart , he brought forth a Pure Creation in his Wisdom , and by his Eternal living Word he divided and separated the Mater , which in the Chaos was in a heap of Confusion , and what he commanded by his Word , it came to pass , and as he said it should be , so it was done ; and in his Wisdom a Pure Creation was finished , as he commanded ; and when he had stretched forth the Heavens , and placed the Lights in them ; and when he had laid the Foundation of the Earth , and brought forth the Herbs and Trees therein ; and when he divided the Waters , and the Fish multiplied in them ; when the Fowls of the Heavens had their flight in the Air , and fourfooted Beasts , and creeping things , had their way upon the Earth ; then did the Eternal Word in the Wisdom , make Man in his own Image , and breathed into him the Breath of Life , and he became a living Soul , and the Lord God filled him with Wisdom and Understanding , and gave him Dominion over all the Works of his Hands ; and Man in the Wisdom of God ruled over them all , he stood in the Wisdom , and received Counsel , and had his Way in the Holy Life ; he walked in the Paradise of Pleasure , and fed upon the Tree of Life ; he lived in still communion with his God , and his living Soul stood in his living Virtue ; and the Breath of Life was always reaching to it ; he was in the pure Oneness with God that made him , and the Image of the Holy Life was upon him , and he was in the Power , Wisdom and Strength of God , and bore the Image in Righteousness and true Holiness , without any mixture ; and all things stood clear in the Separation as they were created , and there was no mixture to defile : then did the Wisdom behold his Work , and lo , it was very good in his sight , and he had great pleasure and delight therein , and his Mercy , Love , Goodness and Tenderness was to it , and his Blessings and Peace was upon it ; and Man enjoyed the living Presence of his Maker , and did partake of his Love , Mercy , Blessing and Peace ; he had a free course unto the Wellspring of Life , and there was nothing stood in his way to let him ; so the Breath of Life was breathed , and in it the Soul lived , and was in perfect unity with it ; and this came into Man through the Wisdom of the Creator , according to his own pleasure , and as it seemed good in his own sight ; it was not a thing from without , but the pure operation of the Power and Wisdom within , after he had form an earthly Body , and brought forth a visible Creation , that he might fill it with his heavenly Treasure , and with his Holy Life , which in his Wisdom he breathed into it , and brought forth the Man in his own Image , and there was no mixture in his Life and Being , which is the earthly body's Nature , and it is a Compounded Vessel , yet so prepared and form in the Wisdom , as to be a Vessel for the Incorruptible Image of Life , which had its course through it , and filled it with its heavenly Being , and there was no mixture of the Earthly in it : And this was the Man that was made after God in Righteousness and true Holiness , and bore his Image in perfect Glory ; and the Body was prepared to be a Vessel fit for his own use who made it , that he might fill it with his Pure Holy Life , which he breathed into it in his Wisdom , whereby Man became a living Soul , and bore the Heavenly Image ; and here Man stood in obedience to the Father of Spirits , who had made him a spiritual , holy , righteous Man , and fed him with spiritual holy Food ; and Man had no will nor desire after any Creature , but stood in the Eternal Will , and ruled over all the Creatures , and his desire was to enjoy the Holy Life , in which he was generated and brought forth ; and what he desired to partake of in the Life , it was ministered unto him according to the good Pleasure of the Creator , in whom he had his Life and Breath , and lived in the pure Enjoyment of the Eternal Being , in which he was daily comforted , and continually satisfied : and in this state no Sin or Evil was committed by him , nor no Curse reached him , nor no Death was upon him , nor no Grave did hold him , nor no Wrath went forth against him , but in the Mercy he lived , and Mercy was his portion , and his delight was in his Maker , and with him he walked day and night , and he had Liberty in Paradise without Restraint , and the Tree of Life he had free course unto , and the Cherubims and flaming Sword were not set to fence it ; So was Man created in Righteousness , and served God in Righteousness , and lived in the Life of Righteousness , and he was not in the mixture of any Unrighteous thing , but was created in the Wisdom of God , and bore the Image of God , which drew its Breath and Life from the holy Fountain of its Generation , and stood in the Eternal Essence of the Divine Nature ; and so did the Everlasting God of Wisdom , Power and Strength bring forth his own Work , in which his own Name was glorified , and then he rested from ill the Works that he had made . 

CHAP. II The state of Man in the Degeneration , and also the Serpents Working . 

When the Pure Creation was finished in the Eternal Power and Wisdom , it rested in the Holy Order of Life , and was in the Pure Harmony and Oneness with the Creator , and there should have rested in the Holy Order , and not have moved ●●t in the Power and Wisdom of Life ; but there was a part which did not keep its station , but moved out of the Wisdom , and wake the Order , and did aspire towards the Equality of the Holy Essence , for which cause it was cast down by the Power , and driven into the lowest parts of the Creation , and was there to have its place and habitation at the furthest distance from God ; and his Anger kindled against it , and he driven it down in his Anger , and his Wrath abides upon it , and it is sealed down in the Anger and Wrath without recovery ; and this is the place of that part which kept not in the holy Order of the pure Creation , but aspired to have been equal with the Power , and his name is Serpent , the Devil , and his place is Hell , the bottomless Pit , where the Almighty God exerciseth his Wrath , without ceasing ; because through the Aspiring , the Creation went out of its holy Order , in which it was created good , and in which it should have rested with God , and have had its Order in his Power and Wisdom ; and when this Aspiring Part was cast down into the Lowest Part , it became beastly , carthly , sensual and devilish , and was more subtle than any Beast of the Field ; and having now lost his place in the Pure Creation , and cast down in the Separation , where the Almighty's Wrath was exercised upon him , without ceasing , and he was always in the Torment of the Anger and Wrath , which sealed him down without recovery ; then did he labour with his Subtlety to draw out of order , that which yet did keep its station and order , and to beget a motion out of the moving of the Power ; and the Lord God having given a Command unto Man in the day that he put him into Paradise , and charged him , Not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil , for in the day thou eatest thereof , thou shalt die , saith the Lord God ; which the Serpent knowing , and having in his fall seen through the Creation , he attempted the Woman , because she was nearest unto Man , being given as one meet to be an help unto him , and being also the weaker part of the Creation , and in his Subtlety he tempted her to eat of the fruit of the Tree , that God had forbidden , and he said unto her , hath God said , ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden ? and the Woman said unto the Serpent , We may 〈◊〉 of the fruit of the Trees of the Garden , but of the fruit of the Tree which is in the midst of the Garden , God hath said , ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die . And the Serpent said unto the Woman , ye shall not surely die ; for God doth know , that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes shall be opened , and ye shall be as Gods , knowing Good and Evil : And when the Serpent had entered the Woman with this Temptation , and had drawn her mind to look at it ; then she saw that the Tree was good for food , and also pleasant to the eye , and to be desired to make one wife , and she did take and eat , and did give also to her husband , and he did eat : So through the weaker part of the Creation did the Subtlety work , and thereby reached unto the strongest , and entered and prevailed with the strongest , that the Creation moved out of the Power , and contrary unto the Power ; so the Power was transgressed , in which all should have rested , and not have moved but in the Power , and the Creation went out of order ; then Man fell from the Power and Wisdom of the Creator , and harkened to the Voice of the Deceiver , and transgressed against the God of his Life , and so he became a degenerate plant , and lost his Authority over the Creation , and became subject to the Serpent's subtlety ; then was he driven out of Paradise , and was driven into the Earth , where he became corrupted and defiled amongst the mixtures of the Earthly Properties , and so lost the Heavenly Image in which he was created , and an Earthly Image came upon him in the generation of the Serpent's subtlety , and the World entered into his heart , and from the foundation of it the Lamb was slain , and in the World the Serpent seated himself , and exercised his Power , and became a god of the World ; and then the Tree of Life was fenced with Cherubims and a flaming Sword , and what way soever Man turned in the Serpent's subtlety to have come and tasted of the Tree of Life , the flaming Sword turned and met him ; then the Serpent wrought deceivably , and began to generate in the mixture of the Earthly Properties , into which Man was driven , and in which the Serpent had got dominion over him , and in a moment all the Faculties and Properties of Man changed , and he was suddenly turned from the Image of the Heavenly , to the Image of the Earthly , and so he became an Earthly Man , with an Earthly carnal mind , that was at Enmity with God , and an Earthly Wisdom sensual and devilish , in which the Serpent stood exalted , and had dominion over Man , that brought the pure Creation into Bondage , where it groaned and traveled in pain ; and here was the pure Creation lost , as it stood in the mercy and love of the Creator , and it fell from the Mercy and Love , into the dark Mixtures , where the Wrath is exercised , and so became a Subject of the Wrath , where the Curse came upon him , and Death over-shadowed him , and Hell enclosed him , where the Torment , Anguish and Pain is . then the Compassion of the Eternal Mercy moved , and the Love opened , and the Seed was promised , that should bruise the Serpent's Head , that had so betrayed and deceived Man , that Man therein might again be recovered out of the dark Mixtures , where the Wrath is exercised , and be restored into the Love and Mercy which he did partake of , and was his portion in the pure Creation ; and through the Serpent's subtle working , the first holy Image was lost , and a defiled Earthly Image came up , which marred the Beauty of the Holy , and the mind that was gone into the Earthly could see no beauty or comeliness in it , that it should desire it , so could never love it , but hath ever appeared at enmity against it ; and the Earthly Image is most desirable to the Earthly Mind , and appeareth most beautiful ; and so the Rejoicing standeth in its like , whether it be Heavenly , or whether it be Earthly , and Man in the Fall is in the Mixture of the Earthly part , where the Serpent hath generated , and also brought forth an Earthly Image , which hath its nourishment from the old Creation , and its vital parts have their course through the Mixture of the Earthly Properties ; and in the old Heavens and the old Earth Man hath his way , and the Earth is become his habitation and his dwelling-place : And thus is Man degenerated , and out of Paradise driven , and from the Tree of Life fenced , and is become an Earthly man , with an Earthly Image . 

CHAP. III The state of Man in the Separation , and also the Serpents Working . 

When Man had transgressed and sinned against the Power and Wisdom of God , and was driven out of Paradise , and fenced from the Tree of Life , he became a servant to the Subtlety , and followed his leading downward , and turned a Wanderer in the Earth , where the Serpent led him in dark corners , and in dry paths ; and Man being joined unto him , he became an Enemy unto God , and full of Cruelty in the Serpent's Enmity unto every thing that was good ; and the treacherous Enemy wrought deceivably to keep Man under his Dominion , into which he had drawn him with his enticing temptations ; and when any thing arises and breathes towards the Lord , he standeth ready with his devouring mouth to swallow it up and destroy it ; and he having the dominion over Man , he makes him bow at his will , and with his subtle working , keeps him in the Earthly habitations , and Earthly paths , into which he hath drawn him , and there holdeth him in the Separation from God that made him , and leads him about in the dark Imaginations of the Earthly part , and there doth beget and generate the things that be evil and sinful ; so that Man is become deformed , and hath lost that pure Image in which he was created , and is turned into the Serpent's beastly nature , and is acted and ordered by his unclean spirit , that bringeth forth the deeds of darkness , and leads Man to commit sin with greediness ; and Man having lost the Authority in which he ruled over the Creatures , he is fallen under the power of darkness , and the Serpent hath weakened him , and set the Creatures over him , and then leads him to commit evil in the use of the Creatures , and Man's heart being run into them , and become subject to them , he is taken Captive with them at the will of the Serpent ; and hence it is that Drunkenness and Gluttony , Pride and Covetousness is come to rule over Man , and the Devil hath him Captive in them , and he neither knoweth what to eat , nor what to drink , nor what to put on , nor how much Earthly Substance to desire , the Serpent hath so drawn his heart to lust after Evil , and he is always willing , but never satisfied , that when he hath received sufficiently of the Creatures for his present need , yet he lusteth to receive more , and the lustful desire still presseth eagerly , not being contented with so much as is needful ; so a Man drinketh in his need and is refreshed , but the Lust not being therewith satisfied , the Devil provokes the Will to press after more , and when Man gives way to the Lust , and follows the Lust , he follows the Devil who is the father of it , and therein he serves the Devil ; and being overcome with the Lust , he is in bondage to it ; and when the Will gets forth in the fleshly liberty , the Devil puts it speedily forward into Excess , and Man's Lust is not satisfied until he have received so much of the Creatures , as deprives him of the right use of the natural faculties of the visible Creation , and turns him wholly into the Serpent's beastly nature , who in that state rejoiceth over him : and here the Devil hath his Dominion , and hath brought Man under him , and under the Creatures , which he had dominion over in the pure Creation ; so the heart lusteth after Drinking until a Man be drunk , and lusteth after Eating until a Man be glutted , and that he doth not know what to eat , and he is become a servant to obey the Devil's movings , who leads him and acteth him in those things which he begetteth in him , and centring the mind downward he leads Man in the lowest parts of the Earth , and there generateth a lustful desire after Earthly things ; so that Man coveteth after the Earth , and after the profits that arise from it ; and as it doth increase , so the heart is more in love with it , and the Lust eagerly pursues after more enjoyment of it ; and this is the Covetous man in his way , the Devil persuades him he hath not yet enough ; such a thing he wants , and when he hath obtained that , than the Devil hath another ready to present unto him , and he thirsteth after that , and presseth eagerly to enjoy it , and there is no end of his lustful desire that runs in the Covetousness ; and hence ariseth all Deceit , Fraud and Guile , because the Covetous desire in the Lust watcheth to improve itself , and to get some advantage by it , so that one Man defrauds another , and cheats and beguiles one another , because the lustful desire in which the Devil worketh , coveteth after unlawful gain , thereby to be made Rich , and come into Esteem amongst Men , and so to be set up in Honour and Dignity in the world ; and when he comes so to be preferred amongst Men , yet he is not contented , but lusteth after greater Honour , and still to be promoted and set up in higher Dignity ; and here Man comes into the Honour below , but doth not understand the Honour that is of God , and so is like the Beast that perishes ; and this Honour puffeth up the Man , and exalteth him in the Pride of his heart ; and as the Earthly Substance increaseth , so Man is esteemed and honoured amongst Men , and the Rich are preferred , and the Poor they are contemned and despised , and then the Rich exercise Lordship over the Poor ; and the Devil he works in the lustful desire , to seek after Respect , and to be honoured amongst Men , and in the 〈◊〉 of the People , and the heart it is puffed up with it , and if it be not given as he expects it , than the Devil provokes the l●st to Anger ; and here came in the Respect of persons , and ●…ing , and Cringing , and Scraping , and putting off the Hat 〈◊〉 respect of the Person , who hath made himself Rich by dis●…st gain , and is set up to rule by his Earthly substance , and 〈◊〉 by the Power of God ; and this is the Generation of the Devil , as Man is in the Separation from God , for in the beginning it was not so ; and here Man is willing , and lusting , and striving after riches and Honour , and a worldly Glory , and all seeking who should be greatest , and set up highest that they may rule over others ; and when they are set up , than they exercise Lordship over others , and expect Subjection from all Men unto their Power ; and when there is something that cannot bear that , there the Devil worketh and provoketh to Anger , and Envy , and Malice , and Hatred , and Evil-will , because one he would be Ruler , and another he would not be Ruled over ; then the Devil worketh in the dark places of the Earth , and there stirs up Cruelty one towards ●other , and setteth one against another ; and neither he that Ruleth , nor he that is Ruled over , are contented with their Places , but a strife there is who should be greatest ; thence comes Wars and Contentions , and destroying and kill one another , the Devil having Rule he provokes man to be Angry and Envious , and Malicious , and generates in the Lustful Will that seeketh after Revenge ; and this is the nurthering spirit , that hath its course through the dark places of the Earth , that is full of Cruelty , and hath drawn the mind of Man after him , and hath begotten in him the many Lusts , from which the many Sins and Evils do arise and are brought forth , that are contrary to the pure God , who in the beginning made all things good ; and the Devil hath generated in Man a Kingdom of Darkness , and there hath set up himself as a Prince , and in his subtlety ruleth over Man , and what he willeth in the Lust that is performed , and under his power is Man captivated , and the many evils committed ; and it is not so with Man in that state as it was in the beginning , but the Serpent hath deformed him , and hath begotten many lustful desires in him , and he eagerly thirsteth after the visible part of the Creation , whereby he hath lost his Union with the pure Power and Wisdom of God , in which he was created good , and is gone into the Corruptibles , and bringeth forth corruptible deeds , which presseth the pure Creation , and keepeth it in bondage , and daily increaseth the weight upon it ; so that the Creation groans and is in sore travail and pain , and the Devil and his work is come up over it ; so that Covetousness , Drunkenness , Gluttony , Pride , Envy , Malice , Wrath , Anger , Evil-will , Deceit , Fraud , Guile , Truce-breaking , False-accusing , Incontinency , Headiness , Highmindedness , Foolish Jesting , Idle Talking , Vain Communication , Sco●…ing , Reproaching , Reviling , Time-serving , Men-pleasing , delighting in Sports and Pleasures ; these are become the very Life of Man , and his Delight is daily in them : which doth separate him from the Enjoyment of the Pure God that made him , who in his Wisdom made all things good , and there was no such thing brought forth in his Pure Creation , but hath been begotten by the Serpent's Generation , since Man's Degeneration , and are all come up since the beginning , through the Devils subtle working , for he is the father of them all ; and whose life is in them , or whose delight is after them , they are his children , and are separated from God , and alienated from his Life , and the good things they taste not , but the streams of Gods pure Refresh are dammed up , that they cannot flow in their own course through the Veins of the pure Creation , to quicken the Inner man , and raise it up , the Old man with his deeds stops it , and there is Adam in the way , which is truly the first , and is lifted up in the Earthly part of the visible Creation by the strength of the Subtlety ; and stoppeth the flow and course of the Invisible Love and Life of the Creator , in which Man had his Communion and Satisfaction before Transgression . 

CHAP. IU. The Way and Works of Man in the Separation , and also the Serpents Working . 

Man having lost the Power and Wisdom in which he was created , and in which he ruled over the Creatures , and being drawn downward by the strength of the Subtlety , he is degenerated from the way of Holiness and the works of Righteousness , and is led in the paths of Darkness , and hath his course in the visible part of the Creation , and in the defiled way of his own Invention , which is broad and leads him to Destruction ; and in it he will's and runs , and there the Serpent hastens him , and putteth him forward speedily , that he may not at any time stand still , lest he should consider the evil of his way and turn from it , and here he leads Man in the Separation from God , and draweth him in the crooked path of his subtle devising , and then begetteth a Delight to walk therein ; so that Man's heart is variously affected with the diverse Objects and Appearances that the Serpent presents unto him and affects his heart withal , that his love and delight is wholly in them , so that he loveth his Pleasures and Profits more than God : and in what way the Serpent leads him , he in his subtlety laboureth to make that seem right unto him , and draws a deceitful cover over them , so that many are blinded and do not see the thing as it is in its filthiness ; Hence the Drunkard saith , My way is Love to my Friend : and the Covetous man , My way is Providence and Carefulness ; and the Proud man , My way is fashionable and Comely ; and the Deceiver , My way is Wit and Policy ; and the Foolish Jester , My way is Mirth and Gladness : So doth the Devil lead Man , and blinds his mind , that he cannot see wherein he is deceived , but walketh on and presseth forward , until he come to the End , where the Pit is prepared : and this is the broad way in which Man walketh , and where he satisfieth the Flesh , with the Affections and Lusts ; and all the evil things proceed from the deceitful heart , where the Serpent hath his generation , and so comes Murder , Adultery , Covetousness , Drunkenness , Pride , Envy , Malice , with all the things that'are Evil , which separates Man from God , and keeps him afar off ; and in this state no Man pleaseth God , nor none doth good , for all his works are brought forth from the strength and power of Darkness , who hath his course through the fleshly part , and in the flesh he generates a lustful desire ; and when Man joineth unto the Temptation which the Serpent offereth unto the Lust that he hath generated , than Sin conceiveth , and when Sin is conceived , it is brought forth , then Death comes over Man , and here Sin entereth , and Death by Sin ; for the Wages of Sin is Death ; and as Man liveth after the flesh , he dies ; for all his works are corrupted and unclean , and the Pure God hath no pleasure in them , but as Man walketh in them he is under the Condemnation , and the Wrath and Curse is upon him , and the Hand of the Lord is against him ; and whether it be profaneness , or a Profession of Godliness that riseth from the Darkness , and hath its course through the fleshly part of the Creation , it is condemned and judged with the Spirit , and he that walketh after the flesh , and satisfieth it in the Lust which the Serpent hath generated , whether it appear sinful , or have a show of Godliness , Death comes over Man in it , and he dies because his doings are fleshly and carnal ; and Death is come over all Men , forasmuch as all have sinned ; and whilst Man's way is in the fleshly part , and his works brought forth in the lust of it , Death is upon him , and he dies the same death as the first Man in the Transgression , and there is no respect of persons , but he that sinneth without Law , he shall perish without Law ; and he that sinneth under the Law , shall be judged by the Law ; so shall every man's way and work be proved , and he will be recompensed according to what he doth ; and he that soweth to the flesh , he shall of the flesh reap Corruption , and in that state he cannot inherit Incorruption ; so that the Drunkard , the Swearer , Liar , Proud , Covetous , Boaster , Envious , Wrathful , Foolish Jester , Vain Talker , Whoremonger , Murderer , Deceitful Hypocritical Professor of Godliness out of the Power of God , cannot inherit the Kingdom of God , for they are in the unclean nature , and their way and works are in the flesh ; and he that liveth after the flesh shall die , and cannot inherit the Kingdom , but is in the Separation from God that made him , and in the Uncleanness that cannot come to him , but must keep at a distance from him ; for Righteousness and Unrighteousness have no fellowship together , and with that polluted garment Man cannot come into God's pure Paradise , nor enjoy his pure Presence , but is separated afar off from him , and there is plunged in woeful misery , and groaning , and sighing in the lowest parts of the visible Creation , where the Serpent is Prince , and ruleth over him ; and as Man liveth and walketh in the flesh , and bringeth forth the works of it , he is a degenerated man , and is at a great distance from God , and the Earthly part is over , and makes the Separation , and burdeneth the pure Creation , which is held in bondage , under the Mixture of the fallen Properties that are out of order ; and it is needful that every man consider his way and his works , and in time lay it to heart , seeing all have sinned , and none in Sin can be saved , nor none in the flesh can please God , neither can flesh and blood inherit his Kingdom ; and who live and walk in it , are separated and afar off from God , where his Wrath is exercised , and his Judgements executed , without respect of persons . 

CHAP. v. What it is that doth Convince Man of Evil , and also the Serpents Working . 

Man being drawn into Disobedience through the subtle working of the Prince of Darkness , he became a Transgressor of the Pure Power and Wisdom of the Creator , and so went out of the Good , in which he was created , and went into the Evil , by obeying the Tempter , and then did eat of the Mixture into which he fell , and the Imaginations of his heart became evil continually ; and the Evil wrought more and more to get dominion over the Good ; and Man being into the Mixture fallen , the Evil prevailed , and Sin entered , and Death by Sin ; so as all have sinned , and are deprived of the Glory , and alienated from the Holy Life ; yet did the Seed retain its own pure holy quality and property , without any mixture , and it was not extinguished in the Fall , but kept its purity , though Man went from it , and did not abide in it , and the pure Light in its own quality did shine in Man's Conscience , and was made manifest in the Eternal Love , to convince Man of all his evil ways and works which he was fallen into , and it did shine in Darkness , and discovered the deeds of Darkness , and convinced Man of the Evil of them ; so was Adam convinced that he had transgressed , and he did himself : Cain was convinced that he had murdered , and he cried because of his punishment : Saul was convinced of his Cruelty , and he said to David , thou art more righteous than I : and the Light of this Holy Seed of Life shines forth in the Love , and is made manifest in the Conscience of fallen Man , and is freely given of God unto him to seek him in his fallen Estate , and it hath its course through the properties of the visible Creation , and searcheth out Man's Life and Treasure ; and whatsoever the Subtlety hath drawn Man's Mind into , and begotten a Life in it , the Light searcheth to him , and convinceth and reproveth him in his own Conscience , so that Man cannot hide his secrets , but still he is found out with the searching Light ; for it shines in Darkness , though Darkness comprehend it not , and with its pure brightness it doth discover the deeds of Darkness , and also the Prince of Darkness , and makes manifest his secret workings , and let's Man see that he is a Stranger unto God , and an Alien from his pure Life , and is serving that spirit that is at enmity with God ; and it let's him see the evil works that he commits , and in which he is an Enemy unto God : So hath the Love of God been made manifest in the Light of the Seed of Life , which through all Generations hath been the same , and with its pure quality it hath found out the Enmity of Man's deceitful heart , with all deceitful workings , and hath brought hidden things to light , whereby Man hath come to see how his mind hath been exercised , and after what it hath inclined , and after what his heart hath lusted ; and as at any time the Lust hath pressed unto Evil , and to follow the things that are Evil , the Light hath been near to convince Man of it , and to reprove him for it ; and with this Pure Light , which hath had its course in Man through all Generations , hath all Evil Deeds been made manifest , and with the Light in Man's Conscience condemned , and all the Good Deeds have been ju●●●ed and approved ; and when Man hath done well , he hath been accepted , but when he hath done evil he hath been judged ; ●nd though the Subtlety , with his secret working , drew Man ●m his Rest in God , and disordered the pure Creation , yet the ●●●ver and Wisdom preserved itself , and retained its glorious Quality and Property without any Mixture , which hath ●●s course through the Mixture , to find out Man again that 〈◊〉 gone from it , and is fallen into the Mixture : So doth the ●●●d God wait that he may show Mercy , and through all Generations his Mercy hath been made manifest , that in Mercy●e ●e might restore the Creation into its holy Order , and bring Man●●●m ●●●m under the Power of Darkness , and set him free out of bondage , that no Corruptible thing may abide upon him , into which he is fallen through disobedience , but that it may be taken ●●ay and removed , and the Lamb quickened and raised , who ●●●n the foundation of the World was slain , and that he may ●ome into his pure Dominion without any spot or blemish ; for he 〈◊〉 more pure than to mix with any Corruptible thing , but the Corruptible thing presseth his tender Life , and the weight of it he ●●areth , and in much patience he suffereth under it , the Just 〈◊〉 the Unjust , that he may again bring Man unto God , and re●●●e the Creation into its pure Order where it rested with God , 〈◊〉 had its motion in the Power and Wisdom of God ; and this 〈◊〉 Christ the holy Seed , with whom the Covenant stands sure , ●●ed unto whom all the Promises are made , and in him alone ●●●e Yea and Amen ; and the Seed hath been ever revealed , to ●●ite the Serpent's head , and to destroy his work , and through 〈◊〉 Generations it hath wrought through the fallen Properties of the visible Creation , and hath found Man in all his 〈◊〉 - goings , and in his secret walking in the paths of Darkness ; and it hath ever made manifest the lustful desire , as it hath at ●ny time reached forth unto the thing that is evil , and it hath convinced Man in his own Conscience when he hath lusted after any evil thing ; this it hath done in Generations past , and its pure property doth not alter , and Man , through the Convincement that reaches to him in the Light , is made a sensible Man , and in his own Conscience knoweth that he should not do Evil , and he seeth the Evil in himself before he commits it , and as the Temptation prevails over him and draws him , he sees that he approaches near unto the Evil ; and so all Men are left without excuse , forasmuch as Evil is made manifest unto them , and they are in their own Consciences convinced of it , and see it before they do commit it ; and who run into Evil , or are found in the Evil , either in Thought , Word , or Deed , they transgress against the Light , which from the holy Seed of Life shines forth in the Love , to discover , and also to convince Man in his own Conscience of the thing that is Evil ; and Man is here in the Fall , where all the Properties of the whole Creation are out of order , and his lustful heart eagerly pursueth those things that are Evil , and yet wherever he runs in the Fall , or in what path soever the Serpent leads him , the Light doth discover it , and makes the Evil manifest in his own Conscience ; so that the Drunkard is convinced 〈…〉 is evil , as he is in the uncleanness of it , and that wh●… 〈◊〉 ●…vince him , is the Light in his own Conscience , and the Light which shows him Evil , it is pure without any 〈◊〉 of Evil : The Deceitful man is convinced that he is no Just , and that which doth convince him of it , is the Light of Christ in his own Conscience ; and that which let's him see that he is Unjust , is Just and Holy : The Liar is convinced that his deeds are evil , and he sees it in secret whilst he yet retaineth it in his breast ; and that which let's him see it in his own breast before it be spoken , and convinceth him of it , is the Light of Christ in his own Conscience ; And that which let's Man see a Lie , and convinces and reproves him in his own Conscience for it , that is true , and there is no deceit in it , and it is made manifest to destroy Lies , and the father of Lies ; and there is not any thing that the Subtlety hath generated , or doth generate in his deceitful working , but with the true Light , that enlightens every man that cometh into the world , his deceitful work is discovered , and Man thereof convinced that it is evil ; and the Serpent's deceitful working amongst the fallen Properties , in which he begets every lustful desire , is with the Light ●…ced , and the secret of his working made manifest ; for the ●●rpent hath seated himself in the mixture of the Earthly Cor●…ible part , amongst the fallen Properties , and hath his course 〈◊〉 the Darkness , and there generateth a deceitful heart , out of which proceedeth all manner of Evil that defileth the Man ; 〈◊〉 he hath gendered a body of Sin , which in the Corruptible ●…pertiess he hath begotten , and he hath wrought deceivably , 〈◊〉 hath drawn Man's mind after Sin , and hath also begotten is love and delight in it , and so provokes a lustful desire ea●…ly to pursue it , and yet it never can be satisfied in it ; but 〈◊〉 Man runs in this path of the Serpents devising , and follows 〈◊〉 in his leading , and lusteth after his Temptation , he dra●…h a burden upon himself , and cometh into much trouble , 〈◊〉 something there is underneath that groans with the weight 〈◊〉 those Lusts and Sins which the Serpent hath generated into ●…body ; and this is a contrary nature , and is not of the Cor●…ible , but with the Corruptibles is oppressed and burdened ; 〈◊〉 with those things that the Serpent hath generated since the ●●ginning , and hath drawn Man's life into , the whole Creation 〈◊〉 put out of its Holy Order , and traveleth in pain , and the 〈◊〉 course of Nature is set on fire , whereby Man is depri●…d of that pure Understanding in which he was created , and in ●…ich he discerned through the Order of the whole Creation , 〈◊〉 had knowledge of it as it stood in the Power and Wisdom 〈◊〉 God : And though Man be thus far degenerated , and hath 〈◊〉 his Understanding that he had in the Manhood , and that the ●…pent hath drawn him into the fallen properties of the Corrup●…le part of the Creation , in which he is become as a Beast ●…thout Understanding , and doth not know the God of Power 〈◊〉 Wisdom , nor the Order of his Creation ; yet in this dege●…ed state in which Man is thus separated and afar off from 〈◊〉 , there is a pure holy Seed abides within him , which in its 〈◊〉 Light and Brightness reaches unto Man's deceitful heart , ●hich the Serpent hath begotten in him , from which the Lust ●…seth and the Evil proceedeth ; and with its Light and ●…ightness it truly discovereth all the Evil that in the deceit●… heart is generated , and it doth truly convince him of the Evil , whether Thoughts , Words , or Deeds ; and when the deceitful heart lusteth to Anger , and that Anger is kindled in Man's breast , with the Light it is made manifest , and with the Light Man is convinced that he is exercised in the thing that is evil ; and whatsoever is of the Serpent's generation , and hath its conception in the deceitful heart , it is with the Light found out , and there is nothing can stop its course from passing through the fallen properties to find out Man , who is become an evil-worker , and to convince him of all his evil deeds ; and Man cannot escape the Light , though he walk in the midst of Darkness , and have his way in the dark places of the Earth , and tread in the Serpents devised paths , and bring forth the works of his begetting ; yet doth the Light find him out , and with it he is convinced , and it is in his own Conscience placed , that all his evil deeds he may see , which from the Corruptible part of the visible Creation do arise , which separateth him from God , and keepeth him in the alienation from the Holy Life . 

CHAP. VI How Man standeth in a Convinced state , and also the Serpents Working . 

When Man in the Fall is overcome of Evil , and that his deceitful heart brings forth a birth of the Serpents begetting ; the pure Light , which hath its course through the fallen properties , comes to him with a Convincement , and let's him see that he is an Evildoer , and that he is not exercised in the thing that is good ; and when the Light hath thus found him out , and convinced him , it doth also truly and plainly discover unto him , that his way is not right , neither is his doings approved of God ; and if he go on without Repentance , he must perish : and in the Light Man sees his Conscience defiled , that there is uncleanness upon him , and that his heart is not upright , but deceitful ; and Man will acknowledge this in words , and say he hath a deceitful heart , and many evil things proceed out of it , and he is sensible of them ; and as they are conceived and generated in his heart ; they are made manifest unto him , and he in his Conscience is convinced that they are exceeding sinful : Many Man in his Wickedness will thus confess , though he be wholly in the fallen properties where the Devil ruleth over him , and acteth and ordereth his mind at his will , yet the Light reaches to him , and so far convinceth him , as to confess he is an Evildoer , and a sinful man ; and this Confession will the Drunkard make , and the Liar and Swearer : And whatever Man is acted in by the Serpent's Subtlety , the Light doth convince him of it , and brings him at some time to confess his Wickedness ; so that every Man is left without excuse before the Pure God , in that he sees his Evil with the true Light of Christ , the Seed of God , which passeth through all the Properties of the visible Creation , and doth make the way of Darkness manifest : And this Light hath been within Man ever since the Breath of Life was breathed into him ; and though the Fall came upon Man in the Subtlety , and that he fell into the Mixture of the Properties of the visible Creation , yet the Light which was breathed in the Life , whereby Man became a Living Soul , it was not extinguished by the Fall , neither was its Property changed by going into the Mixture , but it did retain its pure holy Nature , though Man was enticed from it into the Mixture , where he entered into the Evil ; and this pure Light of Life hath thorough all Generations been the same , and with its searching quality it hath found out all the Evil that Man hath or doth commit , and hath and doth convince him of it ; and what it was in the beginning , it hath never been changed in its Property and Quality , but hath continued pure , holy , righteous and meek , as it is at this day ; and what is come into Man since the beginning , that is not of its nature , but is contrary to it , that it convinceth Man of , and testifieth against ; and all the Devils works which he hath begotten in Man since the beginning , with the Light which was in the beginning they are made manifest ; and the Light was before Sin entered , and with it is all Sin and Evil , which is the Devils work in Man , discovered and reproved ; And as the Serpent hath got dominion over Man , and begets his evil deeds in him ; even so doth the Light discover them , and let's Man in his own Conscience see them , and the Light is in his own Conscience made manifest to bruise the Serpent's head , and to destroy his work : And this Testimony is sure , though the Subtlety cannot receive it ; and all that ever came to be acquainted with the holy Seed of Life , they never testified of another thing , nor ever preached another Gospel ; so that the same Gospel that was preached unto Abraham , hath been and is the same through all Generations ; and this pure quality of the holy Seed doth not cease from searching after Man , who into the Mixture of the Properties is fallen , and there it doth strive with him , by convincing and reproving , that he might not there abide , but that he might arise and follow it , and come to inherit the Life in which he was created good ; and this is the Love of God , which was , and is , and is to come ; who would not have any to perish , but rather that they would turn and live ; and though his Love be so freely made manifest , and hath an universal course through all the fallen properties , to find out Man who is there in the disorder , and walking in his disorderly and unruly affections , which the Devil hath begotten and exerciseth him in ; yet doth not Man receive his Love in the tender of it , neither turns at the reproof of the Light which from the Love is made manifest ; but he loveth his evil deeds more than he loveth the Light ; so doth not come to the Life , but is held with the Serpent's Subtlety in the Mixture of the fallen properties , and there his delight is in Evil more than Good , for which the Light condemns him , & the Evildoer cannot escape the Convincement of the Light for his Evil deeds , but whatever it is that he lusteth after , and hath a life in , with the Light he is found out ; and if it be never so secret , he cannot hide it from the Light ; and though the Serpent do beget and generate many Evil things , and provokes unto Evil Concupiscence , and exerciseth Man's mind therein , yet the Light doth not cease to bear Testimony against Man in the Evil , and to convince him of his Evil deeds : Hence it is that Man stands in the Acknowledgement of his Sin and Evil , but not turning to the Light when he is convinced by it , and doth see his Evil in it , he still abides in the Evil , which he sees to be Evil , and is convinced of it ; and the Serpent having do●…on over him , worketh a persuasion in him , that the Light which convinceth him is not sufficient to save him , and thereby generates unbelief , and draws away Man's mind for ●…ding to the movings of the Light , or for waiting to know the Operation of its Power ; and Man regarding the Serpent's Counsel , he is drawn away from the Light , and can●●t believe that it is sufficient to save him ; and so Man doth ●●t turn to the Light when he is convinced by it , because disbelief hath entered him , as to the sufficiency of it to do him good , and the Serpent still holding Man under his power , ●e persuades him that the Light is but some part of the named property , and so calleth it a Natural Light , or a Na●…al Conscience , or the most Tender part of a Natural Man ; and that it is not any thing of God , neither can save or give Eternal life though it should be obeyed ; and it is but a deceived way , in which many poor deluded people do run rashly ; and it is not the Redeemer , nor Mediator , nor Intercessor ; for that is proper to the man Christ , that died at Jerusalem ; and Man must place his Faith in that very thing done , for Life and Salvation , or he cannot be saved ; and if he do but so believe , his sin shall not be imputed , though he live in it and do commit it : This is the fair show of the Serpent's likeness , by which he hath deceived many people , in begetting unbelief to the Light of Christ in their own Conscience , that shows them Sin , and convinceth them of it , and begetting an Imaginary Faith , to be saved by the Man Christ that died at Jerusalem , though in Sin they abide : and hence it is that Sin is showed , but not destroyed , which Man seeing , the Serpent persuades him that it cannot be otherways whilst he beareth the natural body ; for Nature is prone to Sin , and none can be free from it until that body be laid in the Earth : Thus the Serpent worketh Unbelief to the Light of Christ in Man , and begets a false Faith to believe in Christ without him , and not in any ways within him , for that is Delusion , saith the Serpent ; and in the Serpent's false Faith which he begets , Man believes that though here in this World he sin out his time , yet hereafter in the World to come he shall be saved : So the Serpent's faith puts the day of Salvation afar off , and draws Man's mind into disobedience and unbelief to the pure Light of Christ in his own Conscience , which is Salvation to the Ends of the Earth , unto all that believe in it ; and it doth search after Man , and convince him of his Evil , that he might turn and live ; but Man not obeying , he comes not to know the Life and Virtue that is in it , neither to partake of the benefit of it , So knows not the Man Christ that died at Jerusalem , nor his Life and Salvation , his Mediation and Intercession , but abides in the Mixture of the fallen properties , where he is a Corruptible Earthly Man , without any Change wrought in him by the Power of Christ , whose pure Light is Incorruptible : and here Man stands convinced with the Light , and sees the things that are Evil ; but not believing in the Light , which makes Evil manifest , he still abides in the Evil , and is not converted . 

CHAP. VII . How Man stands in a Converted state , and also the Serpents Working . 

The Pure Creation being in sore travail and pain , through the disorder of the fallen properties , where the Serpent hath seated himself over all that is called God , whereby he keepeth Man in the Alienation from the Life of God , where Death's shadow is over him , and sore grief and pain upon him , which doth heavily oppress him , and make him go mourning day by day , so that Man comes into a consideration of his state and condition ; and as he pondereth in his mind , a pure Light shines forth in his Conscience , that doth discover to him , at what a distance he is from the pure God , and how he is alienated from his Life , and what a great body of Corruption there is within him , that causeth his separation from God ; and when this is made manifest unto him , he is stricken down in the sense of his misery , and is brought into waiting , to see if he can meet with any thing ●…elp him and relieve him , something he feels that cries after God , which , with the body of sin , is separated from 〈◊〉 ; and there is an Enquiry made which way to come un●… him , and how to be freed from those things that separate from him ? and whilst the Earnest goeth unto the Lord , the ●ight shines forth more and more , and discoveries are made , and Man in the Light begins to appear unto himself to be ●…eding sinful , and begins to call in question many ●…ngss that he hath lived in ; and the Light discovers them 〈◊〉 be of the unclean nature , and Man begins to dislike them , 〈◊〉 he cannot so delight in them as he hath done in times 〈◊〉 , but begins to be serious , and to wait in the Light which ●oth discover them , to see if he may be preserved from ●…em ; for he sees them to be evil , and that they do defile 〈◊〉 , and are an heavy burden unto him , and a sore weight ●pon him ; and by attending to the Light , and obeying the light which makes them manifest , he receives some power against them , and begins to get some victory over them ; and ●…ough Man in this state have little acquaintance with the light , yet there is a true turning to it , according to the manifestation of it , and the knowledge that is then given by it ; and so far a true Conversion is wrought , as Man turns ●●om the Evil , unto the Light which makes the Evil manifest , and Man hath forsaken much Evil in obedience to the light ; and hath ceased from much Vanity that sometimes ●e hath lived in , and departs out of the unclean path of com●…on profaneness ; and those things that once was lovely to 〈◊〉 , are now become loathsome ; and he ceaseth from Drun●…ness , and superfluities in Meats and Drinks , which he hath been accustomed to , and from Lying and Swearing , and ●…gious Apparel , in which he sometimes hath lived with ●elighting ; and that which worketh this Change , and begets a Man some Moderation , it is the pure Light of the holy Seed , which never had pleasure in Man , as he is exercised in the things that are evil ; so hath it ever found Man out to convince him ; and as he obeys it , there is a Cord of Love ●ast about him , to draw him and convert him ; and here the lord worketh the Conversion , and Man is converted : and into this state have many come , who with the Light have be●… convinced , and also from many evil and profane things converted , and yet from the bands of death have never perfectly been loosed , but have been still kept in the house of bondage , and the Serpent hath wrought deceivably to betray Man into another thing , and bathe laboured to lead him forth into some Profession , where he walketh like a Sober man , and a Moderate man , to what he hath been in times past , and he comes into a fairer show than when he first lived in the common profaneness ; and when the Serpent hath drawn his mind hither , and hath brought him into some fair show of Godliness , and Man sees that he is much reform in his Evil ways and courses that sometimes he walked in , he begins to neglect the Light in his own Conscience , and to follow his Profession that the Serpent hath drawn his mind unto , and hath set up without him , and Man draws his Contentment from what he professeth , and with this false Conception that the Serpent hath generated in the Imagination he hath deceived many , and caused them to err from the right way ; and Man hath gone from the Light after he hath been convinced with it , and also turned from many evil things by it , and hath become the greatest Enemy to it ; for it is the hardest to renew such a man , who hath been once enlightened , and for a time hath had some inclination towards it , and hath known something done by it , and then turns from it , he becomes the hardest and turns most against it , and quenches and stops the power of it , that he comes not to be a Regenerated Man , nor to know the New Birth born , in which the holy Order of the pure Creation stands ; but the Serpent hath brought form his many Births and Likenesses , whose deformity and impurity hath marred the true Births Beauty , so as little Comeliness hath appeared in him that he should be desired ; and here the many Ways and many Religions are come up , and many things that are profane they are denied , and the Scriptures they are professed , and with this fair show are many satisfied ; yet doth the Light of Christ in Man's Conscience search after him in ●his Professing-state , and though now it do not appear against him as a Drunkard , or a Swearer , yet it appears against him as a Will-worshipper , and a Timeserver , and a Man-pleaser , and against his Double-mindedness , Unstableness , and Hypocrisy , and with its pure quality finds it all out , and searches through the fallen properties , in which the Serpent generates his profession , and brings forth the birth of it ; and though there be a seeming difference betwixt Profaneness and such a show of Godliness , their generation is in the womb , and they receive their nourishment out of the mixture of the fallen properties , which are in a Chaos of confusion , and is Mother , Mystery Babylon , in which there is no true order ; so that the Profaneness and the profession of Godliness are both defiled , and with the Light that is pure they ●●e both condemned : This is truly the state of many , and thus far have many come , and never could get further , who have taken up their Rest in the formal Profession , where there is neither Relief nor Satisfaction , and have not endured the ●●ght of Affliction after they have been enlightened , but have gone from the Gate that is called Straight , which is near to the Pool of Healing , and have not patiently waited until he hath come to bid them take up their bed and walk ; they could not lie and 〈◊〉 , but have struggled away , though lame and impotent , and have gone from the Gate , called Straight , and have straggled into the way that is broad , and there are got over the Cross , and have healed themselves in a false liberty , which stands in a seeming show of Godliness ; and in this state there is yet a travail in a strange Land , and something breatheth after i● Native Country , where no Corruptible Mixture is ; and with the Light Man in this state is searched , and his deceitful heart discovered , out of which proceedeth both the Profaneness and Profession of Godliness ; and with the Light his heart opens , and he comes to see that his heart is not upright before the Lord , neither is his heart the same with his Profession , but feigned humility and hypocrisy lodgeth in it , and the Light smites him and corrects him , both for his Profession and for his Profaneness ; then Man comes to see himself miserable , and to behold both his own Righteousness and filthiness , to rise out of the Mixtures of the fallen properties , and sees himself in the weakness of the Corruptible Being , and there he is sensible of the correcting hand of the Lord , though he hath denied much Profaneness , and be turned into a Profession of Godliness , and Man comes to see that he is sucking a fruitless fountain , and a dry breast , and so comes to mind the Light and wait in it , and it ariseth and pulleth down his strong Holds , and layeth his fenced Cities waste , and brings to naught the Glory of his fair shows , and stains the Pride of them ; and he comes to see that those things which he is observing without him cannot bring contentment to him , but still the Light searches him , and pursues him , and lays many sore and heavy stripes upon him , and also sets his sins in order before him , and let's him see what a great body they are gendered in , which makes him cry in his misery , Who shall deliver me ? and he comes to be sensible of his own Insufficiency , and to know that without Christ he is miserable for ever , and that without Christ he can do nothing ; and so sees that all without him are miserable Comforters , and that there is no help to be found in them when there is need ; and then he something more inclines to the Light within him , and is diligent unto it , and begins to harken and obey , and to turn to it and mind it , and to wait to feel its motion ; and as it doth convince him of Evil , he hath regard unto it , and yields himself to obey , and to deny that which it doth convince him of , and then comes to feel that it leads him out of it , and also destroys it , and takes it away ; and hereby Man comes to be satisfied that it is the Truth of God , and the way wherein he ought to walk , and he waits to feel its drawing , and it turns his face towards it , and begets a willingness to give up to follow it ; and so Man is not now only convinced , but also converted and turned , both from common Profaneness , and also from his seeming show of Godliness ; and he becomes a follower of the Light , and to deny himself in many things that the Light makes manifest to be Evil ; and in the Leading of the Light he is kept in the Cross to his Corruptible will , and walketh in the straight gate and narrow way , and feels something of the Power to crucify and remove many fleshly Lusts , that have made War against his Soul , whereby he comes to feel that he is somewhat eased , and much weight taken off and removed , which had been upon him , and a sore burden unto him ; and something begins to spring in the Deliverance that cried for it ; and when the Light hath thus found Man , and Man is turned unto it , and that he cannot abide any longer , either in Profaneness , or seeming show of Godliness ; but presseth in the Light to come wholly out of the Mixtures of the fallen properties , to come into the holy Order of the pure Creation ; then doth the Serpent strive in his Subtlety to hold Man in some part of the Mixture , that so he may in something yet keep dominion over him , and that he may not be set wholly free , but may serve him still in something , though he have truly denied many things : And hence it is that many stick in the Birth , who are convinced what is Truth , and also in many things converted , and yet feel not true Freedom wrought , but are sensible of a Travel that cries after a day of Deliverance ; and here hath the Serpent deceived many , who have been convinced , and have had true opening and clear discoveries in the manifestation of the Light , and not being watchful , the Serpent hath stepped in , and with his deceitful working he hath beguiled Man , as he beguiled Eve , and with the same fruit hath tempted , and over many hath prevailed , and hath drawn many minds in the opening to reach forth in the eagerness to satisfy his lustful desire in the knowledge of God's Truth ; and this hath shut the Womb upon the Babe that tries for deliverance , and so the Judgement hath been fled , and the Cross hath been denied , and a false liberty out of the fear hath got up , and it hath gendered unto sore bondage ; and though the Truth be confessed unto , and professed in practice , yet doth the Seed lie in bondage under the puffed-up mind , that the Serpent hath filled with knowledge , in which he hath generated a Body , and brought forth a false Birth , whose neck is stiff , and the heart hard , and will not bow unto the Lord , nor be subject to his Power , but in knowledge stands exalted , under which the true Birth is oppressed , and the beauty of it marred by the false Generation of the Serpents begetting , which rises out of the Mixture and receives its body from the Earthly part of the fallen properties ; and Man having seen the Truth in the Opening , and the vain mind being filled with the knowledge of it , he takes root in the Earthly , and in the Earthly he begins to grow and spread forth his branches with a fair and flourishing show ; and this Earthly body that is thus conceived and generated , and likewise nourished in the Mixture of the fallen properties , gets a tincture of Truth upon it in the Opening , as Led may be covered or tinned with pure Gold ; and this Body beareth a fair show , and appears exceeding glorious , but is not the Glory of the only Begotten ; and when this is brought forth through the deceitful working of the old Serpent , than he labour's to nourish it that it may grow in strength , and be a tall man , and a strong man , and be renownable ; and this being desirable , it hath been eagerly pursued , and knowledge hath increased , and a great growth there hath been in it ; and Man hath waxed into a high stature of it , and hath sprung up in height like a Cedar in Labanan , and hath grown in the body of knowledge like an Oak in Bashan ; and under this high and mighty growth of knowledge , hath the little breathing Innocency been strangled , and sore burdened and oppressed , and hath still been striving underneath in the meckness and humbleness , and hath oft reached the tall Cedar to bring it down , and to the strong Oak , to make it bend ; but the Cedar would not lose its glory , nor the Oak part with its strength , but stoutly have stood , yea , and stubbornly resisted the tender Innocency , and have cast off the Word of its Reproof ; and the tall Cedar hath been lifted up , and hath said , who shall rule over me ? and the Oak it hath been stubborn , and hath said , Who shall cause me to bow ? And so they have trampled over Innocency , as a thing of no esteem ; and the Gold hath been kept in the Mixture , and the clean Separation hath not been made , but the Subtlety hath wrought over it , and hath kept the Dross and Tinn above it , and Man hath not liked the Furnace , neither hath been willing to abide the Day of his Coming in that Manifestation , but hath saved his Life in the Mixture , in which the Serpent's Dominion standeth , who in his Subtlety hath ever wrought secretly against the Seed of Life , which is made manifest to bruise his head , and destroy his work ; and though Man may be convinced , and in many things converted , and may have followed the Light in the Selfdenial and daily cross , to many of the World's Fashions , Customs , and Traditions , yet may the Seed be still closed in the Womb of the Earthly Mixtures , and travel in sore pain for want of deliverance ; and as the Power hath risen in Man , and hath begun to work in the Furnace , and to divide and separate betwixt the Precious and the Vile , and the Furnace hath been truly set to have refined , and the Fire hath begun to take hold to have consumed , that the Seed out of the Mixture might have been redeemed , and an Holy Birth regenerated ; then hath the Serpent violently stirred , seeing his Kingdom so near to be destroyed , and he in great danger to be cast out and dispossessed ; and he hath suddenly drawn Man from the Power , and out of the Furnace that should have refined and brought forth the Gold without Mixture , and he instantly hath begotten Man into a false liberty , and hath exalted him over the Cross and Judgement , that the Life in the Earthly could not abide , and there hath the Enemy wrought in his Subtlety , and hath drawn Man's mind into a fleshly liberty , so as Man unto the World returns again , and unto the World's Fashions and Customs is a Man conformable , and then dare say in the stoutness of his heart , that he liveth with God in the Inner man ; and having seen much , and also tasted something of the Word and Power , but not in the Furnace abiding , to know a clean Separation made , and a perfect Regeneration wrought , he becomes a very subtle worker , and a great Enemy to the pure Innocency , being fled into the fallen properties to save his Life ; and from this ground a monstrous Birth is generated , and by the strength of the Subtlety brought forth , and it is not in any ways like the true Birth , born in the Regeneration , which from the holy Womb proceeds , and in the Furnace is brought forth , without any Mixture of the Earthly part ; and where it is truly born , it changes the whole Man throughout , and perfectly redeems him out of the World , with the Pashions , Customs and Traditions , and it hath its nourishment from the Breast of the holy Life , and grows in the pure holy nature of it , and is strong in its Power , in which it makes war and overcomes the Serpent and his Power : Let the tall Cedars and strong Oaks consider , and stoop and bow , for they must fall and be broken , and the Innocency must reign because it is pure , and there is no mixture in it ; and also let such consider , who have had a taste of the true Power , and have known something of its Work , and are again returned unto Folly , and are flown up into the Air , and pled their fleshly liberty as a thing that is natural to the visible Creation , and dare say , that though such things appear , they do not desile the Inner man , neither do they see ! any reproof for their fleshly and carnal doings , but stand justified before the Lord in their Inner man ; let such know as from the Lord , that they are Birds of the Air , and took their flight in Winter , and the Hand of the Lord will bring them down ; and let the Proud and Arrogant consider , who dare to say that all their works , whether they be good or evil , are wrought in God , and what they do , it is his doings , though it be Drunkenness , or any other Evil , and so are in the devilish spirit , ranting and making merry over the Pure Innocent Life ; let such sink down , and hereby know , yea , as from the Lord , that their Life is for Death , and their Works for Judgement ; for the holy Seed is risen that bruiseth the Serpent's head , and he cannot save it with all his twisting , nor keep his deceitful works from Judgement ; but all his building must be defaced , and all his works destroyed . 

CHAP. VIII . The New Birth in the Regeneration , and also the Serpents Working . 

Man being degenerated from the holy Order of the Pure Creation , and being fallen under the Serpent's power , who is a subtle and deceitful Worker , all the faculties and properties of Man are in disorder , and are become a Chaos of Confusion , and without being regenerated and born again he cannot come into his place in which he stood in the Pure Creation , and enjoyed the Presence of the Pure God ; neither an he come to the Tree of Life , but is shut out and fenced with the flaming Sword ; for the Unclean cannot enter into the Pure , neither can come to feed upon the holy Life , but must with the Sword be cut down , and with the Flame be consumed ; and Man through the fiery Furnace must pass before he can inherit the Kingdom , or possess Eternal Life , which in the Pure Creation was its Rest and Portion ; and with this Pure Light is Man in all his ways found out , that he might return and come again to inherit and possess the life from which he is degenerated and fallen ; and with the Light he is in his own Conscience convinced of the things that are evil , that he might not abide in them , but that he might forsake them , and deny them , and follow the light out of them ; and as Man comes into the Obedience , be comes to know that the Light of Christ in his Conscience , which doth show him Sin , and convinces him of Sin , that it is sufficient to save him from Sin , and redeem him out of Sin , and destroy the body of Sin , and thereby restore him again into the holy Order of the Pure Creation , where he enjoyed the Presence of God , and was good in the sight of God ; and this is that which seeks lost Man , and is made manifest to save and redeem him out of his lost estate ; and all that have believed in it through Ages and Generations , have known the effectual working of its Power , by which they have been redeemed out of the Earth , and from the vain Conversation of the World , and walked as Pilgrims and Strangers in the World ; And this Pure Light was with Abel , and in it he sacrificed , and his Sacrifice was accepted ; it was with Seth , and in it he called upon the Name of the Lord ; it was with Noah , and in it he was preserved , when the Flood came upon the world of the Ungodly ; it was with Abraham , and in it he believed , and it was counted unto him for Righteousness ; it was with Isaac , and in it he was the Heir of Promise ; it was with Jacob , and in it he went over Esau's Mount , and out of his loins came the twelve Tribes , whom God choose for his own Inheritance : it was with Moses , and in it he led forth the Inheritance of God out of Egypt : it was with David , and in it his Horn was exalted : it was with Job , and in it he was redeemed , and knew his Redeemer lived : it was with Isaiah , and in it he saw a Child born , and a Son given : it was with Malachy , and in it he saw the Separation , and the Fuel out of the Mixture : it was with John , and in it he saw the Lamb of God , and did behold the Glory of the only Begotten of the Father . And this pure Light of the holy Seed of Life , hath had its course through all Generations , and hath been made manifest through the several Dispensations and Administrations , as it hath pleased the Father of Spirits , and they that did believe in it , did not abide in darkness , nor did not continue satisfying the lustful desire of the fleshly part , but were Regenerated through the effectual working of the power whereby they became dead to Sin , and alive to God , and were born of the holy Seed , which made them holy Men , and with it they were filled and divinely inspired , and then they testified of its Power , and it was the same thing unto them all , and neither changed its quality nor property , though diversely it manifested itself ; and all the holy Men of God , that gave forth the Scriptures , they had the Name in the Nature of the holy Seed , and were born of it through the Regeneration ; and this was a work that was wrought before Scriptures were written , and was the same work in them that written the Scriptures , and it hath been the same in Generations since the Scriptures were written ; and it is the work of Christ , the holy Seed , and it is proper unto him alone , to regenerate and make a New Man ; and no man can add to the work of Regeneration , for it is an Inward work , wrought by an Invisible Power , that no mortal Eye can behold : And this work at this day is witnessed amongst a Remnant , whom he hath chosen to be his own Peculiar People ; and as Man turns to the Light of Christ in his own Conscience , it will open his own Condition to him , and make manifest every secret thing , that the Serpent hath begotten and drawn his Life into ; and it will clearly discover unto a Man's understanding that they are evil and sinful : and as he mindeth the Light , and obeyeth it , it will lead him out of the Evil that it maketh manifest unto him ; and thus far Man is convinced , and also converted : then the Serpent begins to make war , and lahours to hold Man in those things which he hath begotten in him ; but as Man joins to the Light he will receive strength to stand against him , and also to overcome him ; for after a Man is convinced , and also converted and turned to the Light , than he enters into a great fight of Afflictions , and hath a sore Conflict to pass thorough , as he abides faithful , before he get the Serpent under his feet ; and after Conversion the Serpent besets Man sore , and laboureth with all his might to stop him in his travail , so that Man is sometimes kept by the subtle working of the Serpent , and cannot readily get on , nor clearly cast off those things which be is turning from , in obedience to the Light , but is still ●ept by the Serpent , who labour's to save his head from bru●ing ; and the way that he hath to do it , is to draw Man into the Reasoning , and there to consult how it will be with him , if he wholly give up and deny those things that he is convinced of , and also turning from , and what will be the end if he part with them ; And here have many felt the Dragon's war against the Innocent Lamb , that hath been travelling for Freedom from under the Corruptible things , which have oppressed his Innocent Life ; and Man harkening to the Serpent , and entering into Reasoning and Consulting , the Serpeut keeps the Veil over him , and then shows what great loss it will be unto him if he go on to deny all those things , that he is convinced of to be evil , and is turning from ; and also persuades him , that if he should follow the Light unto the end , and part with all for it , yet it is not sufficient to save him : and under this Veil many stumble at the Light , and draw back and follow no further , though for a time they have in some things been obedient ; and this is the Man that love's something more than Christ , and cannot part with his own Life , for the gain of Life Eternal : And thus doth the old Serpent work for the safety of his Kingdom ; but through his strong holds have many broken , and from his bonds they are loosed in the power of the Light , which being minded and obeyed , it doth convert Man's mind from the thing that is Evil , and ariseth in its power to judge it and condemn it , and upon the Cross to crucisie it ; so that Man dyeth unto it , and it dyeth in Man ; and as a Drunkard mindeth the Light , and obeyeth the Light , when it doth convince him that Drunkenness is Sin , it will lead him out of Drunkenness , and destroy that work of darkness , and take away Man's Life in it ; And this is the Work of Christ , who is made manifest to destroy the work of the Devil , and to burn it up with unquenchable fire , that he thereby may set Man free from under the burden of all Corruptible things ; and whatever it is that the Serpent hath generated in Man since the beginning , and drawn Man's heart to lust after , the Light which was in the beginning , in which is no sin , but pure and undefiled , it doth appear against it , and also every lustful desire that hath its rejoicing in it , and it brings it down with a stroke of severe Judgement ; and as Man in the Light believeth , even so doth it work , and appear in its power , to destroy every Lust in which the Serpent hath dominion over Man , and in which he makes war against the Soul ; and as Man denies himself , and takes up the Cross , and follows the Light faithfully , he becomes a dying man , and the Power separateth between the Precious and the Vile ; and then He will be felt , whose Fan is in his hand , and the Fire will be known which burns up the Chaff ; and as Man abides this Day , and keeps in the Righteous Judgement , the Old Man will be crucified , and all his Deeds consumed , and neither Profaneness , nor seeming show of Godliness , shall stand in the Judgement , but the Tallest must come down , and the Strongest must bow ; for the Fire will not spare , but through the Earth will pass ; and that which is of the Earth must burn , and none can quench ; and Man abiding this Day , and keeping in the Patience , Judgement will be brought forth unto Victory , and Man will come forth dead to himself , and alive in Christ , and so will come to know that Christ worketh that Work which no other can do , and that the Light doth not only show him his Sin , and convince him of it , but if he turn , obey , and believe in it , so it will take the Sin away , and purge his Conscience from the dead works , and redeem him out of all the Lusts which the Serpent hath generated in him , and hath begotten his Life into ; and he will know his Redeemer liveth , and Salvation he will feel in the Light , which doth condemn his sin in the flesh : and here Drunkard is redeemed out of Drunkenness , a Swearer from Swearing , a Liar from Lying , a Covetous Man from Covetousness , an Angry man from Anger ; and so out of all Vain Pleasures , Sports , Jesting , Headiness , Wildness , Customs , Fashions and Traditions that are in the World through Lust ; With the Light Man is redeemed through its Righteous Judgement , for with its pure searching quality it finds out every secret thing of the old lustful nature , and proceeds against it in Judgement ; so that the Serpent cannot escape the Light , but with all his Subtlety he is found out ; and as Man believes in the Light , so doth the Judgement fall upon the Serpent's head ; and though it be long before Man can give up himself truly , to deny all things that he is convinced of to be evil , or before he can get clearly thorough , or to the end of much that he is turning from ; or before he can witness a perfect Regeneration through the fire of cleansing ; yet , as Man in the Light believes and follows it , the Work is going on and prospering , and the Lusts and evil deeds are dying , and the Serpent he is weakening , and doth not come upon Man so furiously and forcibly as formerly , but his Temptations are weaker , and Man in the Light he is stronger , and stands with courage to resist him ; and as Man feels at any time dominion over the Serpent , and that he is able , as he abides in the Light , to resist him ; so doth his strength and courage increase , and he stands boldly in the battle , and yields not when temptations come , but brings them under , and treads them down ; and as the Serpent comes upon Man , and appears to tempt him into that Lust which Man is making war against ; Man stands prepared unto battle , and is strong and of a good courage , and goes forth against him in his first appearance , and in the power of the Light placeth true Judgement upon his head , and bruiseth him , and so Man is preserved from him , and abstains from Evil in the appearance of it ; and this is the Serpent's great design to keep Man alive to himself , and to delight in his hearts lusts , whereby he ruleth over him , and takes him captive at his will , and he is not willing to let him go if all his subtlety can hold him ; therefore many Temptations come upon Man after he is convinced and comes to own the Truth of God ; and as he converts and turns unto the Lord , he is many times sorely beset in his way , and often ready to be driven quite back again : and hence it is that Man finds such a strong Warfare in his Spiritual Travel , and finds it such a hard work to come into the Regenerated State , because there he must deny himself , and forsake all his hearts Lusts , and lay down his Life in the Judgement , and abide the Fire of Refinement ; and as Man in the Light begins to approach near unto this great Work , than the Serpent strives in his subtlety to withhold him and keep him back , and so the two in their contrary natures are felt in the strife ; and this Gate is straight , and few there be that find it ; And as Man stands faithful and abides in the Light , he will feel strength to support him when the Enemy thus violently pursues him , and he will stand a Conqueror over those Lusts that have had dominion over him ; and when the Serpent finds that he cannor keep Man in the Inordinate Affection , and lead him forth to satisfy his Lust to the full , as he had wont to do ; then in his subtlety he abates his Temptation , and persuades Man that he may use things moderately , and keep out of Excess , for it is the Excess that makes it to become Evil , and so to be condemned ; but if he cease from Excess , the moderate use will not bring Condemnation : so he tells the Drunkard , if he keep himself from being drunk , he may moderately keep his Friend company , and he may be merry with him : and he tells the Proud in heart , if they use not Excess in their Apparel , they may go decently according to their quality ; and the like Temptations for other Lusts he hath ; and he tells Man , the moderate use of them will not bring Condemnation : but here some have found him a Liar , as he is , who came to abstain and restrain from the Excess of many things , which once they were serving their Lusts in , and cain down to that which the Devil called Moderation , but found it was in the hearts lusts still , and with the Light was still condemned and judged , and no rest nor peace could be found , until the Devil was wholly denied , and the hearts Lust's given up to the Cross , and there crucified , and thereby Redemption perfectly wrought in the Power of Christ , and then comes the right use to be made of ill things in their place with true moderation ; and in the use of them in the Redeemed state there is no Condemnation , for they are received and used in the fear of the Lord , and what is useful and no more ; and there is no Lust abiding that reaches forth beyond the present need , and there is the Blessing felt ; but Man that hearkens to the Serpent , and takes that for Moderation that he calls so , he is deceived ; and though he lessen the use of that which the Light reproves him for in the Inordinate Affection , yet will the Light still condemn him , and judge him in his own Conscience , until he come to the Power , and there have his Lust truly Crucified : So the Serpent tells the Drunkard , he may drink moderately , and be merry with his Friend : he tells the Proud , he may put on such Garments as are suitable to his quality amongst men , so that he keep within the bounds of Moderation : And many have here denied common Drunkenness , and yet satisfying the old lust in the Excess : And many that cannot wear so many Ribbons , nor great Cuffs , as sometimes they could , yet they must have some bunches of Ribbons , and little Cuffs ; then saith the Devil , thou art now in the Moderation , and dost no more , or hardly so much as becomes thy quality . And now to give one true and faithful Experience , though many in these things might be truly demonstrated : I know a Man who once was alive to himself , and served his Lusts , and loved Pleasures more than God , and in one thing the Serpent had sealed his life more than in many others , and his delight was chiefly in it ; and after he came to obey the Light of Christ in his Conscience , it was clearly discovered unto him to be exceeding Evil ; and though he minded the Light , and stood in the Cross to his lustful desire , yet the Devil did not cease to provoke eagerly , still to satisfy the Lust , though he could not do the thing as he had done in the use of it , the Terror of the Lord was upon him , and his Righteous Judgement reached unto him , and many sore stripes he bore : then saith the Serpent , Lessen thy Inordinate Affection , and it will not be so with thee : then he came from the use of much , to the use of less ; but the Judgement still pursued him , and the Terror increased upon him , and though the use of it was in the end so much lessened , as it was hardly used at all ; yet when it was used , the Judgement ceased not , but Plagues were forthwith poured , and it was just with the Holy God so to do , and he could find no Peace , until he gave up his Life in the Lust , and stood upon his Watch , and whenever the Serpent approached with that Temptation , he placed Judgement upon his head , and so walked in the daily Cross , until he was Crucified unto the Lust , and the Lust Crucified unto him , which now is as dead as if it had never been . Unto Him be Glory for evermore ; who undertaken the Cause , and perfected his own Work. Now Man that comes not to know the Lust crucified in the ground , he is betrayed into a false Moderation , and as he there standeth , he looketh at himself to be above many others , who yet abide in the Inordinate Affection ; and so the Serpent worketh deceivably , to keep Man out of the Furnace , and to lead him afar off from Judgement ; and though the Inordinate Affection may be abated , yet the Lust is not crucified , but the life in it is saved , and Man here fly's for his life , that when he should deny himself and take up the Cross , he denies the Cross and saves himself , and slies the Judgement , and cannot abide that day ; but as Man keeps to the Light , this way will be made easy , and he will be able to tread thorough it , and come to the end of it , and conquer the Serpent who works against him ; and as Man follows the Light faithfully , it brings him to the Judgement and keeps him in the Judgement , and there he waits and abides until Judgement be brought forth unto Victory ; and he , as a willing man , walks in the daily Cross , and cheerfully gives up all his hearts Lusts to be crucified , and then he feels the Enmity slain , that hath begotten and nourished the Lust ; and so Man comes truly through the Furnace , and abides the Fire of Refinement , in which the Separation is made , and the Corruptible is burned and destroyed ; then the Holy Seed of Life appears without any Mixture , and the Creation is delivered out of travail and pain , and in this Fiery Furnace is Man regenerated , where the Old man is destroyed , his hearts Lust's crucified , the body of Sin consumed , the Dross and Tin purged , the Gold clearly separated , and brought forth in its own pure property and quality ; and through this living eternal operation is Man recovered out of the Fall , and the Pure Creation is again restored into its holy Order , in which it was very good , and Man is then redeemed out of the fallen properties , where he hath been lusting after evil , and comes again into the Paradise of Pleasure , and hath his course unto the Tree of Life , and the flaming Sword doth not now fence it from him ; and this is the Regeneration which Man must come to know in the Fire of Refinement , where he must part with all that is his own , whether Filthiness or Right cousness , and come thorough without any unclean thing ; or he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God ; and Man must put off the Corruptible part of the Earthly , where he is in the Degeneration , before he can be brought into the Holy Order of the Pure Creation ; and as the Old he puts off in the Fire of Refinement , and abides in the Work of Regeneration , he comes to the New , and receives the New , and it is born in him , and thereby his , Change is wrought , and he is redeemed out of the fallen Properties into the Holy Order of Life , and he is now no more his own , neither can he satisfy Lust any longer , but is truly dead unto it , and his Life is renewed in the Birth of the holy Seed , of which he is born , and in which he is a New man , and so puts off Drunkenness , and dies to that Lust , and puts on Sobriety , and lives in that Virtue ; he puts off Anger , and dies to that Lust , he puts on ●eekness , and lives in that Virtue ; he puts off Envy , and dies to that Lust , he puts on Love , and lives in that Virtue : and so in all things that the Serpent hath begotten through his deceitful working , that stands in the Old lustful Nature , the Light judgeth it , the Power crucisieth it , the Fire burneth and consumeth it , and so cleanseth Man from his Defilements , and cleareth the way for the Holy Birth to spring , and for the ●●mb that from the foundation of the world hath been slain , to come into Dignity and Dominion to Reign : so to die is gain ; And blessed is the Man that dies in the Lord , he comes to inherit Life and Immortality , and to possess durable riches , and a Life without end ; and is an Heir of God , and a Joynt-heir with Christ , in whom he is made a New Man , and boarss a Heavenly Image , in which the Father is glorified , who is over all , blessed for ever . 

CHAP. IX . The New Creation in the holy Order . 

THE Lord God of Eternal Glory , searches after Man in his fallen and degenerated state , and with his pure Light he finds him afar of , with his feet walking in dark paths , and his way in the Land of Desolation , and there doth he visit him in his poor and low degree ; for Man is fallen from God , and departed from his Maker , the Serpent hath deceived him , and with his subtlety hath drawn him out of the holy Order , and hath enticed his mind into the fallen Properties of the visible part of the Earthly , where he is a servant to the subtle Worker , and satisfies his own hearts lusts that is fleshly , and is a sinner against the holy God , and in the disorder of the unruly affections , where the pure Creation is in Bondage , and traveleth in sore pain , and the old Heavens , and the old Earth moves over it , and heavily oppresses it ; and man in the fallen Estate is never at Rest , nor his heart satisfied with lusting ; and in this Separation from the God of Mercy , is Man plunging in the depth of Misery ; a sinner he is , and Death reigns over him , and wrath is upon him , and in the disorder of the unruly affections , his life is driven about and tossed , and there is no steadfastness in him ; and in this troubled state , there is a cry unto the Lord , and a breathing goes forth that would be in rest , and the Lord hath respect , and hears , and in bowels of pity he arises to help , he stretcheth forth his Arm , and brings the Mountains down ; he comes forth in power and makes the Hills to melt ; he utters his voice , and the Earth trembles , he kindles a fire and consumes it into Ashes ; he brings Man into the Nothingness , and dissolves the old Birth into its dust ; he cause's the old Heavens to pass away with a noise , and he melts the Elements with fervent heat ; and Man no longer lives therein , but his life is taken away , and he lies slain and dead , and there is no motion in him , until the Spirit of Life from God come into him , and create him new into the holy Order of Life , and so gives him breath and being as in the beginning ; and he is made and fashioned with the hand of God , and is the Workmanship of God , in whom he now receives his life , and out of whose bowels he draws his breath , whereby he is perfectly renewed in the spirit of his nind , and hath no old thing upon him , nor Earthly part abiding in him ; but through the fire of Refinement he is made dean , and out of the Virgin's Womb he spring's , and sucks the beast which giveth Life , whereby he grows in strength , and in wisdom increases , and comes into the stature of the fullness of Christ , and partakes of his divine nature ; all old things being put off , and all done away in the fire of Refinement , he comes forth of the Furnace a naked Child , and a new Creation spring's , and a new Creature Man is made , and rises with the lamb in his nature , and the Pearl's glory he is clothed withal , and into the holy order of Life he is restored , and hath his way in the pleasant Paradise , and his food from the Tree of life , and his motion stands in the Power and Wisdom of the Seed , which is come into dominion , and reigns in its pure quality and property , without any mixture , and there is no Corruptible thing abides upon it , but in the Refining Fire is purged and consumed ; and as Man abides the Fire , and waits 〈◊〉 the Judgement , he puts off the Old in which he hath lived , and he puts on the New and is translated ; and here man truly ●…kes to himself , and receives Christ the Seed of Life , and putteth him on , whereby he feeleth Christ made unto him Wisdom , Righteousness , Sanctification , and Redemption ; and in his Power and Wisdom , he brings forth a New Creation in the holy Order of his pure Life , in which the six day's works are passed thorough , and the Separation and Consumption is wrought in the Furnace , where the Fire cleanseth , and the seventh ●…y is come unto , which is holy unto the Lord , in which Man ●…osts from all his own works , as God did from his , and sits down in the power and wisdom of the holy Seed , and rests in the stillness of its divine Nature , of which he truly is made a partaker ; and in it he is transformed , and stands in the holy Order of the New Creation , in which he is perfectly made a new Creature , and hath his motion in the new Heavens , and new Forth , wherein dwells Righteousness ; and with Righteousness he is covered as with a Robe , and Holiness is become his Vesture ; and he bears the Heavenly Image in the Life , and is lovely and amiable to behold , and is in the sight of the holy God , very good . Thus is the New Creation finished with all the host of it , and is brought forth in the holy Order , through the effectual working of the holy Power ; and Man is changed and renewed in the holy Birth of the Immortal Seed , and again is placed in the Paradise of pleasure , and is not senced from the Tree of Life , but hath access unto it , and it is his daily food , and he life's by it , and rests in the comfort and consolation of it , which is Life without end . 

CHAP. X. The Way and Works of Man in the New Creation . 

AS Man believes in the Light , which from the Life shines forth , and in his own Conscience is made manifest , he comes to the Righteous Judgement of God , who passeth Sentence against him , and condemns him to death , where upon the Cross he is Crucified , and there he dies unto himself , with all his heart's lust , both in thought , word , and deed ; then doth the Fire take hold , and burns and consumes , and through its operation wholly dissolves the old Man , and destroys all his deeds ; and through destruction unto the Corruption , there spring's a holy pure Generation , which hath its Conception in the Matrix of Eternity , and is brought forth in the holy Order of Life , and in this holy Generation is Man restored into his first Order , and is truly the Offspring of God , and hath his motion in the Power and Wisdom of God ; and in this Restoration Man is changed , and becomes a new Man in Christ , and his way and all his works are new , and he becomes a Well-doer , and is accepted of God in Christ the Beloved ; and here Man finds the new and living Way , which makes him a new and living Man , and leads him unto the living God ; and this is the Way of Holiness in which the clean feet walk , and Man that is in it ordered , he is in the way of Peace , and is led into the green Pastures of Everlasting Refresh , and he walketh continually by the pleasant Streams , and hath his Course by the River that makes glad the whole City ; and in the holy Life of the Immortal Seed is his Life bound up , and he is ordered in the motion of it , and he doth not stir but in the holy order of it , and it is the strength of his Reinss , and the girdle of his Loins , and keeps Man in close Communion with it , whereby he is strengthened to run the way of every Command , and there is no feebleness upon his loins , but perfect strength in the motion of the holy Seed , which carries him as upon eagle wings ; and he runs and is not weary , he walks and is not faint , and his way is holy , and his works holy unto the Lord , and he is Created in Christ Jesus that he should walk in them , and is no more his own , but in the Lords disposing , and truly serves the Lord in Righteousness and true Holiness ; and he no more thinks his own thoughts , nor speaks his own words , nor works his own works , but is moved and acted in the Power and Wisdom of the holy Seed , of which he is born and made a new Creature ; and his works are works of Holiness , proceeding from the Life of Christ , and man is holy as he is holy ; for unto good works he is Craated in Christ , and his delight in the new Creation is in the thing that is good , and in a new and living Way he walks , and brings forth new and living Works , in the living Power and Wisdom of the holy Seed ; and thus Man is changed , and is made a Holy Man , a Righteous Man , a Godly Man , Sober , chaste , Gentle , Meek , Patient , Loving , Kind , Good , Lowly , Tenderhearted , Forbearing , and Long-suffering , and in all things he walks as becomes the order of the holy Life , into which he is born , and in which he life's and moves , and he becomes a Lamb in the Lamb's nature , and beautiful in the brightness and holiness of the Pearl's Glory ; And thus i● Man translated and changed , through the effectual Working of God's mighty Power ; and with a new heart he glorifies his Maker , and is sincere and upright in his heart before God , and the Lord God takes pleasure in him , and approves his Way and his Work , and justifies him therein , and there is no Condemnation upon him , nor any Wrath or Curse goes forth against him , or falls upon him , but in the Eternal Love he dwells , and the Love dwells in him , and the Image of it he bears , and it is clear from defilement , spot , or blemish ; then doth the Glory shine in the Precious Pearl , and the Sceptre of the Lamb doth bear its sway , and upon his Throne he is exalted , and with pure Righteousness he clothes his Saints , and Crowns of pure Gold upon their heads he sets , and in the Holy Land with him they rest , and in the Holy Order of his Life they move , and they learn the Songs of Holiness , and sing his Praise within the Gates ; for he fills them with Joy and Gladness , and with a New Heart and a New Spirit they sound his Name , and cease not to give Glory , and Honour , and Thanksgiving , and Praise , and Dominion , and Hallilujahs unto him that sits upon the Throne , and to the Lamb for evermore . 

1.  

O ! Mortal Man , thy Way and Works consider ; 
Sleep not in Death , lest thou there die for ever . 
Awake , and stand upright , that thou restored may'st be 
Both from thy Sins and Evils great , with all Iniquity . 
2.  

thou wast created Good , and stoodst in great Renown , 
A Noble Plant thou wast , but soon thou wert cast down : 
The Serpent thee deceived , and drew thee into evil , 
And thou by him art led astray , according to his william  
3.  

From God thou art driven out , and from his dwelling place , 
The Earth thy habitation is , and there thou runnest thy race . 
thou neither stayest nor stoppest , but runnest and hastens on , 
Until thou fallest into the Pit , where bonds of Death are strong . 
4.  

Oh! harken , and be still , the Lord is seeking thee , 
And with his Light of Life , he cries , Return to me . 
This in thy Conscience he hath placed , thy Evil deeds to show , 
That thou may'st to Repentance come , & know the thing that 's true 
5.  

The Light of Christ is true , and shines forth in all men : 
And every Evil deed it brings up to be seen . 
And thou in it may'st know thy Thoughts and Works each one ; 
And in thyself thou may'st behold , whatever thou hast done . 
6.  

If thou unto the Light dost turn , and in it dost believe , 
It will not leave thee in thy Sins , but certainly relieve : 
And unto thee it strength will be , against thy deadly Foes , 
And from thy sins will set thee free , in which thou daily grows . 
7.  

Oh! turn to it with speed , thy danger 's very great ; 
thou art in the broad way , and not in the straight gate : 
〈◊〉 liv'st in Flesh , and servest thy Lust , which cause's wrath to fall , 
That unto thee , in fury , doth come like to bitter Gall.  
8.  

thou hast no pleasure in its taste , because it doth torment ; 
Why then dost thou abide in Sin , and dost not soon repent ? 
The Light doth show , and also call , and makes known unto thee 
Thy Sins and thy Transgressions great , with all Iniquity . 
9  

And as the Light thou mindest , and yield'st for to obey , 
It will not only show thee Sin , but take it quite away . 
〈◊〉 that end it is manifest , the Serpent's head to bruise , 
And all his works for to destroy , if thou dost not refuse . 
10.  

it 's quality is pure , and searcheth through thy heart ; 
It will convince thee in thyself , and tell thee what thou art . 
〈◊〉 will not thee deceive , but will deal plain with thee ; 
And if thou dost in it believe , a Convert thou wilt be . 
11.  

And when thou art converted , keep watchful to the Light ; 
For then the Enemy will stir , and thou wilt find a fight . 
〈◊〉 Life will be required , and thou must lay it down , 
And from the Cross do not thou fly , until the Work be done . 
12.  

So in the Furnace thou wilt know , a New Birth brought to light , 
As in the Judgement thou abid'st , and standest by Faith to fight . 
The Serpent thou wilt overcome , and all his deeds destroy , 
Which have deprived thee of thy Peace , and of thy Rest and Joy.  
13.  

Now hear , all ye Professors , with all that be Profane ; 
You Cedars tall , and Oaks so strong , who have a glorious fame . 
●…u flying Birds , and Ranting Strains , who are soared up on high , 
The Fire is kindled at your Root ; come down before you die . 
14.  

Lie low , and be you still , the Judgement you must pass , 
The true Birth is in Bondage sore ; your Life above it is : 
Which from you must be taken , before the Life you know , 
That from on high , is come to try , in what you stand and grow . 
15.  

Your Births are all defiled , corrupted and unclean , 
The Fire hath not consumed , nor purged away your Tin. 
You yet lie in the Mixture , and are not separate , 
That make the Seed to groan , under the Earthly part . 
16.  

Come forth all ye Unclean , whose Bed is so desiled , 
Come down unto the Pure , and know the Little Child , 
Which in the Womb doth travel , and would delivered be , 
That you may be regenerate , and from all Burdens free . 
The Heavenly Harmony in the Eternal Unity . 

1.  

Thou Pure Simple Birth , of the Immortal Seed , 
Thy Love is sweet and free , thou giv'st to all that need : 
thou 'rt pleasant to the taste , Thy Pasture's fresh and green , 
The Glory of Thy Countenance is now beheld and seen . 
2.  

thou holy Lamb of Life , who comest down from on high ; 
thou art the Shepherd of thy Flock , thy sword 's upon thy Thigh ; 
Stretch forth thy Arm , and smite thy Foes , that would not have thee raig●… 
That Praise to Thee in Unity , may sound abroad thy fame . 
3.  

thou precious beauteous Pearl , that is refined clear , 
Thy Lustre shines in Nature pure ; no Mixture dost thou bear : 
Thy Countenance is full of Love , Thy riches is the Treasure ; 
Thee to possess , is Life Endless : to whom be Praise for ever . 
4.  

The Birth , the Lamb , the Pearl are One , 
the Only true begotton Son , 
Who sits in Glory on his Throne ; 
to whom be Hallelujahs sung . 
Even so , Amen , Even so , Amen : 
Praises to Thee , thou Holy One.  
W. S.  THE END .
