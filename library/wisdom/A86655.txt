A woe against the magistrates , priests , and persons of Kendal in the county of Westmoreland , pronounced from the Lord by one of his prophets . 

Which May warn all the persecuting cities and towns in the North , and everywhere , to repent and fear the Lord , lest the decree go forth against them . 

Also the stumbling-block removed from weak minds , who are offended at the strange signs and wonders acted by the servants of the Lord , scornfully called Quakers in the Northern parts of this nation .

The word of the Lord came unto me saying , write and declare against that bloody town of Kendal , and leave it without excuse . 

Hear ye which pretend to be rulers , and ye that pretend to be teachers , and ye persons , the trumpet of the Lord is sounded , gather yourselves together , for i will plead with you , your iniquities are come up before me , and your transgression is come into mine ears ; woe , woe , and misery is coming upon you , you shall be as Sodom and Gomorrah , and as Admah and Zeboim ; desolation and a cry , a cry , lamentation , howling , bitterness and sorrow shall come upon you at unawares , the sword of the Lord is drawn against you , it is sharpened for a great slaughter , and you shall be cut off , because you have despised my name , and trodden under foot my precepts , and walk after your own wills , and the imagination of your own hearts ; and yet saith the Lord , they say i am amongst them : woe unto you hypocrites , i am weary of you , and of all your profession it stinks in my nostrils , and i abhor it as much as if ye slew a man ; you have slain my son , you have mocked my prophets , and despised my messengers which i have sent early and late to forewarn you of the evil to come , have not i wrought signs and wonders amongst you , as ever was in any day , or from the beginning , have not i made the mountains tumble down in your sight , have not i caused my judgements to fall upon them that have set themselves against me ? have not i cleansed the lepers ? have not i quickened and raised them out of the grave , which were dead in sins and trespasses ? have not i brought down the proud ? have not i exalted the low ? have not i caused the weak things to confound the wise ? have not i sent signs among you , and have sent my servants to declare against you , as i did to Nineveh , and have you not heard it ? have not i commanded my servants to go bare and naked in your sight , to be a sign to you that your covering is now rent , and your garment is to be torn , and you shall be left naked and bare , and you shall be made a mock and a proverb to all , as my servants have been made a mock and a proverb to you ; and i will scatter you in my indignation , and i will cause my fury to rest upon you till i have consumed you ; ye rulers that rule by your own wills , and ye false prophets that cry peace to this persons , and all ye persons that delight in lies , is not all manner of wickedness committed amongst you ? As pride , covetousness , oppression , persecution , mocking , stoning , and imprisoning , haling before magistrates them who are made to do my will , and to declare against you ; ye strive against me , saith the Lord , ye cry a confederacy , ye consult together , ye plot , ye call all your enchanters against me ; thus saith the Lord , ye shall be broken as Pharaoh , and go down to the pit with Egypt , Mesheck and Tubal , and all the uncircumcised ; woe is me , the spoiler is come up against you , and blackness covers you , and a consumption is entering into your bones , my eye shall not spare , my hand shall not pity , but it will bring this upon you , howl and lament ye Okes , ye mountains cleave asunder , and all ye persons , both great and small , be astonished , put on sackcloth , put your mouths in the dust , for i will make my fury to pass over you , and none shall be able to deliver you , said the Lord ; write this , let them know , but they will not hear , till i have caused my fire to burn them up and there be no remedy .

Oh ye raging priests , who have set yourselves against the mighty power of the Lord in his own , whereby he is manifesting his works , his strange works ▪ his acts , his strange acts , making his servants signs and wonders amongst the heathen , and them that know not God , nor his power , whereby he is choosing that which seems foolishness , to confound the wisdom of the wise , which you who stand in your own wills and wisdom , know nothing of ; but in this , as in other things , out of your envy against the truth , take occasion to lay stumbling-blocks in the way of others , wherein you plainly aypear to be in that generation , who will neither enter into the kingdom yourselves , nor would suffer others ; you who take occasion to preach and print against the truth , because the Lord hath caused some of his servants to go naked along your streets , as in Kendal and Kirkby-stephen , as signs of his wrath to come upon that pride and fullness that priests and persons live in ; and this , you who never knew what it was to obey God , contrary to your own reason and wills , ( For who act such things , act contrary to their own wills ) cry out on a delusion and madness , thinking thereby to make the truth odious to others , but it is that the scriptures May be fulfilled upon you , as it hath been on your generation before you , who Counted always what the prophets , Christ , and the apostles did madness , and called them mad-fellows ; but now all you who fear the Lord , and believe his word , take heed of the deceit of these men , and mind not what they say , who have set themselves to speak evil of the things they know not , but search the scriptures and there you shall find , that the mighty God ( Who hath power over all flesh , and what he commandeth none must dispute by their reason ( Though it seem never so foolish , and against their wills ) but must obey ) hath always before his great judgements which he has about to bring on a persons , or nation , made some of his dearest servants to pass and act as signs to such nations of what was to follow , and was so usual among the prophets , and them who knew the word of the Lord , that the prophet Isaiah speaking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , saith , i and the children whom thou hast given me , are for signs and wonders in Israel , from the Lord of hosts that dwelleth in Zion , Isaiah 8. 18.  And if ye search the scriptures of the prophets , you shall see in what strange and foolish things to the wisdom of the world they were acted in , as in Esay 20. the prophet was to go three years naked for a sign , what the Lord would bring upon Aethiopia and Egypt : now had these men lived in his days , they would have cried that up as a delusion and madness , and not as the word of the Lord , as they do at this day ; for they neither know the Lord , nor his word who stand in their own wills : also read the 4. of Ezekiel , and see what a sign he was to both the houses of Israel and Judah , a strange thing to the wisdom as ever was : also read the 5. of Ezekiel , and see what a sign he was to be , and what folly he was to act as to their wisdom , and that in the midst of the city : also ezek. 12. 18 , 19  & 24. 16. to the end of the chap. likewise ezek , 12. to 17. v. and many other of the dear servants of God , who were not only to declare the word of the Lord from his mouth , but also to be signs to them to whom he was to prophecy , that so he Might leave them all without excuse . 

Now those who then were priests , and should have been teachers and leaders of the persons to fear God , and hear his word , and observe his signs , and repent that the judgements Might be prevented , they were the only men that hated , reproached , persecuted , and called the prophets , Christ and his apostles madmen , deceivers , because of these things , which into their wisdoms could not enter , and stirred up the rulers and ignorant persons against them ▪ that they Might put them to death as it is at this day , but these in our days are more inexcusable than all that ever went before them , inasmuch as they had no scripture to show them that the Lord had commanded such signs formerly ; but these have the scriptures that witness to the same thing ; which scriptures they make a trade on , and cry up in words , but are ignorant of that spirit by which they were acted that gave them forth , and envy and persecute that obedience that was acted in them , in whom it is now acted ; and they Might as well cry out against Esay for a madman , because he went naked at the word of the Lord , and the rest of the prophets and servants of God for acting such weak and foolish things , to their wisdom , as they did as against these for obeying the Lord in the same or the like things whatsoever , for God is not tied to any rule to walk by , but his own will ; and where he commands woe to him that doth not obey , and where he commands not , woe to him that acts in his own will , and saith , it is the word of the Lord . Wherefore all ye that fear the Lord , take heed of being stirred np by these men to speak evil of that you know not , but consider that the priests have been always the move•• and persuaders of the persons against Christ and his kingdom , and power in his saints , and instead of being forward to speak evil of the things you know not , turn in your minds into the fear of God , and mind the light in your conscience that will let you see what sins you are guilty of , which these signs are threatenings to , that you May repent of them , and escape the judgement and find mercy , as they did in the time of the prophets , who feared the Lord and escaped the judgement ; but the envious , scorners and fools passed on , and were punished and know this , that a wiseman's eye is in his head and such an one hath his guide within himself , and will not be hasty to follow others though they be multitudes to do evil , and such know it is better to be silent , then to speak evil of the things they know not , and when was there ever any truth of God brought forth , but it always suffered the violence of the proud and haughty , where the seed of the serpent reigns and shows his enmity ; and it is the same now , for that which hath been is at this day , but it is that the power of the Lord May be seen , in carrying on his simple truth , against all the wisdom and power of of the world , and plotting of the serpent , yea and he will carry it on to his praise , and to the confounding all his enemies , who must stumble at the stumbling stone , and be offended at the rock , that must break them to pieces , wherefore be silent all flesh before the Lord , whose foolishness is more than thy wisdom , and whose weakness is more than the strength of all the world , who is a defence to his poor despised ones , in the midst of their enemies . Eternal praises to thee who art our wisdom for ever . 

To all you who have eyes and yet are blind , and who have ears and yet are deaf , and have hearts and yet cannot understand ; to you i am moved to declare . 

The Lord is proclaiming himself to be King , and all the mountains and every isle and every oak of Bashan , and all the cedars of Lebanon , and all who rule as Kings and conquerors shall bow : hear ye deaf , the trumpet is blown , the standard is lifted up , there is open war proclaimed between Michael our paince and all the inhabitants of the earth . Arm yourselves , oh ye mountains and gather yourselves on he•pss oh ye isles , the glittering the sword of the Lord is drawn , and a fire is before him , and all ye will be found as stubble , and you are all to be slain heaps upon heaps , and are all to go down with all the uncircumcised rulers and persons into the pit ; the Lord the mighty Jehovah is revealing himself from heaven in flames of fire to render vengeance upon all the workers iniquity ; for you have slain the heir of the vineyard , you are killing his prophets , and imprisoning his saints ; to you all professors , rulers , and priests , which say you are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan ; i speak in plainness of speech unto you all who live in all the abominations of the heathen , and yet say you love Christ , do not you call the Master of the house now Belzebub , do not ye mock , and set your mouths awry ye sons of the adultress , and of Sodom , at the light of Christ which enlighteneth every one that comes into the world , which light did lead all saints into purity , and up to God , and this you call natural , and them who witness redemption by the son , you call blasphemers ; Christ which you profess and yet know not , was accounted by your generation a blasphemer , and all the apostles and saints were persecuted by your generation as evil doers , as despisers of government , as disturbers of the peace , as leaders of the persons into iniquity , as the offscouring of all things , as sheep for the slaughter , and were all of them put to death and in prison by that generation which professed God , and said they had his ordinances , yet slew them who professed him and kept his statutes ; for if ye be not wilfully blind , are ye not doing the same now ; mocking , haling , imprisoning , bringing before magistrates them that witness Jesus Christ in them , and because they bear witness against all sin ; did ever any of the saints of God persecute , imprison , or hale before magistrates , and falsely accuse any ? Did ever the saints complain to authority to guard them ? Hear ye whited tombs , ye painted sepulchres , what gospel is this ye profess ? what God is this ye serve that must be defended with clubs , swords , rulers , and carnal weapons ; the saints who had the everlasting gospel , said , their weapons were not carnal but spiritual , and yet they were mighty through God to beat down strong holds , even principalities and powers , thrones and dominions ; but your gospel and ministry can do nothing without a sword ; all persons see where you are , & what you are doing , you run headlong to ruin ; those who were despised by that generation of Pharisees & professors which you are in , were a burdensome stone , upon which all that opposed did break themselves ; so this generation whom ye set at naught , ye shall  be made to bow and throw down your crowns before them , and before the lamb who is our leader & guider , glory unto him for evermore ; its hard for you to kick against the pricks , for we witness the two edged sword of the Lord shall bathe itself in the blood of his enemies , and shall  be made fat with slaughter . Oh ye mountains ye shall become a plain for the ransomed to come over you ; all your profession shall be as stubble , and you shall be left naked and bare , and nothing shall be able to cover you , because you are crucifiers of Christ and the saints , repent that you May be hide in the day of his fierce anger , which is to come upon all the workers of iniquity .
