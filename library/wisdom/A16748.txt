TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL and Worthy , Sir Gilbert Houghton , of Houghton Knight , the Noble favourer of all virtuous spirits : the highest power of heaven grant the blessing of all happiness to his worthy hearts desire . 

Worthy Knight : 

The worthiness of this subject , in which is set down , the difference of light and darkness , in the nature of Honour and disgrace , to the deservers of either , hath made me ( upon the note of the Nobleness of your spirit ) like the Eagle , still looking towards the Sun ; to present to your patience , the Patronage of this little Treatise , of the Worthies and Vnworthies of this Age : Wherein , I hope , you will find some things to your content , nothing to the contrary : which leaving to the acceptance of your good favour , with my further service to your command : I humbly rest , 

Your Worship's devoted , to be commanded , Nicholas Breton . 

TO THE READER . 

I am sure that if you read through this Book , you will find your description in one place or other : if among the Worthies , hold you where you are , and change not your Card for a worse : If among the other , mend that is amiss and all will be well . I name you not , for I know you not ; but , I will wish the best , because the worst is too bad : I hope there will no body be angry , except it be , with himself for somewhat that he finds out of order , if it be so , the hope is the greater , the bad will be no worse : yet the world being at such a pass , that living Creatures are scarcely known from pictures till they move , nor Wisemen from fools till they speak , nor Arteists from Bunglers , till they work ; I will only wish the Worthy their worth , and the contrary , what may mend their Condition ; and for myself but pardon for my presumption , in writing upon the natures of more worth than I am worthy to write of , and favourable acceptation of no worthy intention of reprehension , by the least thought of malicious disposition . So leaving my book to your best like , with my better labours to the like effect : In hope to find you among the Worthies : I rest , 

At your command , if worthy , N. B.  

THE GOOD AND THE BAD : OR , Descriptions of the Worthies , and Vnworthies of this Age.  

A Worthy KING . 

A Worthy King is a figure of God , in the nature of government : he is the chief of men , and the Church's Champion , Nature's honour , and Earth's majesty : is the director of Law , and the strength of the same , the Sword of justice and the Sceptre of Mercy , the Glass of Grace , and the Eye of Honour , the Terror of Treason , and the Life of Loyalty . His command is general , and his power absolute , his frown a death , and his favour a life , his charge is his subjects , his care their safety , his pleasure their peace , and his joy their love : he is not to be paralleled , because he is without equality , and the prerogative of his Crown must not be contradicted : he is the Lords Anointed , and therefore must not be touched , and the Head of a public body , and therefore must be preserved : he is a scourge of sin , and a blessing of Grace , God's Vicegerent over his people , and under him supreme Governor , his safety must be his Counsels care , his health , his Subject's prayer , his pleasure , his Peers comfort ; and his content , his Kingdom's gladness : his presence must be reverenced , his Person attended , his Court adorned , and his State maintained ; his bosom must not be searched , his will not disobeyed , his wants not unsupplied , nor his place unregarded . In sum , he is more than a man , though not a God , and next under God to be honoured above man  

An Unworthy King.  

AN Unworthy King , is the usurper of Power , where tyranny in authority loseth the glory of majesty , while the fear of terror frighteth love from obedience : For when the Lion plays the Wolf , the Lamb dies with the Ewe . He is a messenger of Worth to be the scourge of sin , or the trial of patience , in the hearts of the religious : he is a warrant of woe , in the execution of his fury , and in his best temper , a doubt of Grace : he is a dispeopler of his Kingdom , and a prey to his enemies , an undelightfull friend , and a tormentor of himself : he knows no God , but makes an Idol of Nature , and useth Reason but to the ruin of sense : his care is but his will , his pleasure but his ease , his exercise but sin ; and his delight but unhuman : his heaven is his pleasure , and his gold is his God : his presence is terrible , his countenance horrible , his words uncomfortable , and his actions intolerable . In sum , he is the foil of a Crown , the disgrace of a Court , the trouble of a Council , and the plague of a Kingdom . 

A Worthy Queen . 

A Worthy Queen is the figure of a King , who under God in his Grace , hath a great power over his people : She is the chief of women , the beauty of her Court , and the grace of her Sex in the royalty of her spirit : She is like the moon , that giveth light among the stars , and but unto the Sun , gives none place in her brightness : She is the pure Diamond upon the King's finger , and the Orient Pearl unprizeable in his eye , the joy of the Court in the comfort of the King , and the wealth of the kingdom in the fruit of her love : She is Reason's honour , in Nature's grace , and Wisdoms love in Virtue's beauty . In sum , she is the Handmaid of God , and the King's second self , and in his Grace , the beauty of a Kingdom . 

A Worthy Prince . 

A Worthy Prince is the hope of a kingdom , the richest jewel in a King's Crown , and the fairest flower in the Queen's garden : he is the joy of Nature in the hope of Honour , and the love of Wisdom , in the life of Worthiness : In the secret carriage of his heart's intention , till his designs come to action , he is a dumb show to the World's imagination : in his wisdom he startles the spirits of expectation in his valour , he subjects the hearts of Ambition in his Virtue , he wins the love of the Noblest , and in his bounty binds the service of the most sufficient : he is the Crystal glass , where Nature may see her comfort ; and the book of Reason , where Virtue may read her honour : He is the Morningstar , that hath light from the Sun , and the blessed fruit of the Tree of Earth's Paradise : he is the study of the wise in the state of Honour , and in the subject of Learning , the history of admiration . In sum , he is in the note of wisdom , the aim of Honour , and in the honour of Virtue the hope of a Kingdom . 

An Unworthy Prince . 

AN Unworthy Prince is the fear of a kingdom , when will and power carry Pride in impatience , in the close carriage of ambitious intention , he is like a fearful dream to a troubled spirit : in his passionate humours he frighteth the hearts of the prudent , in the delight of vanities he loseth the love of the wise , and in the misery of Avarice is served only with the needy : he is like a little mist , before the rising of the Sun , which , the more it grows , the less good it doth : He is the King's grief , and the Queen's sorrow , the Courts trouble , and the Kingdom's curse . In sum , he is the seed of unhappiness , the fruit of ungodliness , the taste of bitterness , and the digestion of heaviness . 

A Worthy Privy Counsellor . 

A Worthy Privy Counsellor is the Pillar of a Realm , in whose wisdom and care , under GOD , and the King , stands the safety of a Kingdom : He is the Watchtowre to give warning of the Enemy , and a hand of provision for the preservation of the State : he is an Oracle in the King's ear , and a Sword in the King's hand , an even weight in the balance of justice , and a light of grace in the love of truth : he is an eye of care in the course of law , a heart of love in his service to his Sovereign , a mind of honour in the order of his service , and a brain of invention for the good of the Commonwealth : his place is powerful , while his service is faithful , and his honour due in the desert of his employment . In sum , he is as a fixed Planet 'mong the stars of the Firmament , which through the Clouds in the air , shows the nature of his light . 

An Unworthy Counsellor . 

AN unworthy Counsellor is the hurt of a King , and the danger of a State , when the weakness of judgement may commit an error , or the lack of care may give way to unhappiness : he is a wicked charm in the King's ear , a sword of terror in the advice of tyranny : His power is perilous in the partiality of will , and his heart full of hollowness in the protestation of love : Hypocrisy is the cover of his counterfeit religion , and traitorous invention is the Agent of his Ambition : He is the cloud of darkness , that threateneth foul weather ; and if it grow to a storm , it is fearful where it falls : he is an enemy to God in the hate of Grace , and worthy of death in disloyalty to his Sovereign . In sum , he is an unfit person for the place of a Counsellor , and an unworthy Subject to look a King in the face . 

A Noble man  

A Noble man is a mark of Honour , where the eye of wisdom in the observation of desert sees the fruit of Grace : he is the Orient Pearl that Reason polisheth for the beauty of Nature , and the Diamond spark where divine Grace gives Virtue honour : he is the Notebook of Moral Discipline , where the conceit of care may find the true Courtier : he is the Nurse of hospitality , the relief of necessity , the love of Charity , and the life of Bounty : he is Learning's grace , and Valour's fame , Wisdom's fruit , and kindness love : he is the true Falcon that feeds on no Carrion , the true Horse that will be no Hackney , the true Dolphin that fears not the Whale , and the true man of God , that fears not the devil . In sum , he is the Darling of Nature , in Reason's Philosophy ; the Lodestar of light in Love's Astronomy , the ravishing Sweet in the music of Honour , and the golden number in Grace's Arithmetic . 

An Unnoble man  

AN Unnoble man is the grief of Reason , when the title of Honour is put upon the subject of disgrace ; when , either the imperfection of wit , or the folly of will shows an unfitnesse in Nature for the virtue of Advancement : he is the eye of baseness , and spirit of grossness , and in the demean of rudeness the scorn of Nobleness : he is a suspicion of a right Generation in the nature of his disposition , and a miserable plague to a feminine patience : Wisdom knows him not , learning bred him not , Virtue loves him not , and Honour fits him not : Prodigality or Avarice are the notes of his inclination , and folly or mischief are the fruits of his invention . In sum , he is the shame of his name , the disgrace of his place , the blot of his Title , and the ruin of his house . 

A Worthy Bishop . 

A Worthy Bishop is an Ambassador from God unto man , in the midst of war to make a Treaty of peace ; who , with a general pardon upon confession of sin , upon the fruit of Repentance , gives assurance of comfort : He brings tidings from heaven , of happiness to the World , where the patience of mercy calls Nature to Grace : He is the silver Trumpet in the music of Love , where faith hath a life that never fails the beloved : He is the Director of life in the Laws of God , and the Chirurgeon of the Soul , in lancing the sores of sin , the terror of the Reprobate , in pronouncing their damnation ; and the joy of the faithful , in the assurance of their salvation . In sum , he is in the nature of Grace , worthy of Honour , and in the message of Life , worthy of Love : a continual Agent betwixt God and man , in the preaching of his Word , and Prayer for his people . 

An Unworthy Bishop . 

AN Unworthy Bishop is the disgrace of Learning , when the want of reading , or the abuse of understanding , in the speech of Error may beget Idolatry . He is God's enemy , in the hurt of his people , and his own woe , in abuse of the Word of God : he is the shadow of a Candle , that gives no light ; or , if it be any , it is but to lead into darkness : the Sheep are unhappy , that live in his fold , when they shall either starve , or feed on ill ground : he breeds a war in the wits of his Audience , when his life is contrary to the nature of his instruction : he lives in a room , where he trouble's a World , and in the shadow of a Saint , is little better than a Devil ; he makes Religion a cloak of sin , and with sergeant Humility , covereth incomparable Pride . He robs the rich , to relieve the poor , and makes fools of the wise , with the imagination of his worth : he is all for the Church , but , nothing for God , and for the ease of Nature , loseth the joy of Reason . In sum , he is the picture of Hypocrisy , the spirit of Heresy ; a wound in the Church , and a woe in the World.  

A worthy judge . 

A judge is a Doom , whose breath is mortal upon the breach of Law , where Criminal offences must be cut off from a commonwealth : He is a sword of justice in the hand of a King ; and , an Eye of Wisdom in the walk of a kingdom : his study is a Square for the keeping of proportion , betwixt command , and obedience , that the King may keep his Crown on his head , and the Subject his head on his shoulders . He is feared but of the foolish , and cursed but of the wicked ; but , of the wise honoured , and of the gracious beloved : He is a surueier of rights , and revenger of wrongs , and in the judgement of Truth , the Honour of justice. In sum , his word is Law , his power Grace , his labour Peace , and his desert Honour . 

An unworthy judge . 

AN unworthy judge is the grief of justice in the Error of judgement , when , through ignorance , or will , the death of Innocency lies upon the breath of Opinion : He is the disgrace of Law , in the desert of Knowledge , and the plague of Power , in the misery of Oppression : He is more Moral , then Divine , in the nature of Policy , and more judicious , then Just , in the carriage of his conceit : His Charity is cold , when partiality is resolved , when the doom of life lies on the verdict of a jury , with a stern look , he frighteth an offender , and gives little comfort to a poor man's cause . The golden weight overwaies his Grace ; when Angels play the Devils in the hearts of his people . In sum , where Christ is preached , he hath no place in his Church ; and in this Kingdom , out of doubt , God will not suffer any such Devil to bear sway . 

A Worthy Knight . 

A Worthy Knight is a spirit of proof , in the advancement of Virtue , by the desert of Honour , in the Eye of Majesty : In the field he gives courage to his Soldiers , in the Court , Grace to his followers , in the City , reputation to his person , and in the Country honour to his House . His Sword and his Horse make his way to his House , and his Armour of best proof is an undaunted Spirit ; the Music of his delight , is the Trumpet and the Drum , and the Paradise of his Eye , is an Army defeated , the relief of the oppressed , makes his Conquest honourable , and the pardon of the submissive makes him famous in mercy : He is in Nature mild , and in Spirit stout , in Reason judicious , and in all , Honourable . In sum , he is a Yeoman's commander , & a Gentleman's superior , a Noble man's companion , and a Princes worthy favourite . 

An Unworthy Knight . 

AN Unworthy Knight is the defect of Nature , in the title of Honour , when to maintain Valour , his Spurs have no rowels , nor his Sword a point ; his apparel is of proof , that may wear like his Armour , or like an old Ensign , that hath his honour in rags . It may be he is the Tailor's trouble in fitting an ill shape , or a Mercer's wonder , in wearing of Silk ; in the Court he stands for a Cipher , and among Ladies like an Owl among Birds : He is worshipped only for his wealth , and if he be of the first head , he shall be valued by his wit , when if his pride go beyond his purse , his Title will be a trouble to him . In sum , he is the Child of Folly , and the man of Gotham , the blind man of Pride , and the fool of imagination : But in the Court of Honour , are no such Apes , and I hope that this Kingdom will breed no such Asses . 

A Worthy Gentleman . 

A Worthy Gentleman , is a branch of the tree of Honour , whose fruits are the actions of Virtue , as pleasing to the Eye of judgement , as tasteful to the Spirit of understanding : whatsoever he doth , it is not forced , except it be evil , which either through ignorance unwittingly ; or , through compulsion unwillingly , he falls upon , he in Nature kind , in Demeanour courteous , in Allegiance loyal , and in Religion zealous , in service faithful , and in reward Bountiful : He is made of no Baggage stuff , nor , for the wearing of base people ; but is woven by the Spirit of Wisdom , to adorn the Court of Honour . His apparel is more comely than costly , and his Diet more wholesome than excessive , his Exercise more healthful than painful , and his Study more for Knowledge then Pride ; his Love not wanton , nor common , his gifts not niggardly , nor prodigal : and his carriage neither Apish , nor sullen . In sum , he is an approver of his Pedigree , by the Nobleness of his passage , and , in the course of his life , an example to his posterity . 

An Unworthy Gentleman . 

AN Unworthy Gentleman is the scoff of Wit , and the scorn of Honour , where more wealth than wit is worshipped of Simplicity : who spends more in Idleness , then would maintain Thrift , or hides more in Misery , then might purchase Honour : whose delights are Vanities , and whose pleasures Fopperies , whose studies Fables , and , whose exercise , worse than Follies : His conversation is Base and his conference Ridiculous , his affections Ungracious , and his actions . Ignominious . His Apparel out of fashion , and his Diet out of order , his Carriage out of square , and , his company out of request . In sum , he is like a mongrel Dog with a velvet Coller , a Carthorse with a golden Saddle , a Buzzard kite with a Falcons Bells , or a Baboon with a pied jerkin . 

A Worthy Lawyer . 

A Worthy Lawyer is the Student of knowledge , how to bring controversies into a conclusion of Peace , and out of ignorance to gain understanding : He divides Time into uses , and Cases into constructions : He lays open obscurities , and is praised for the speech of Truth , and in the Court of Conscience pleads much in Forma pauperis , for small fees : He is a mean for the preservation of Titles , and the holding of possessions , and a great instrument of Peace in the judgement of impartiality : He is the Clients hope , in his Cases pleading , and his hearts comfort in a happy issue : He is the finder out of Tricks in the craft of ill conscience , and the joy of the distressed in the relief of justice. In sum , he is a maker of Peace , among the Spirits of Contention , & a continuer of quiet , in the execution of the Law.  

An Unworthy Lawyer . 

AN Unlearned and unworthily called a Lawyer , is the figure of a Foot-post , who carries Letters , but knows not what is in them , only can read the superscriptions , to direct them to their right owners . So trudgeth this simple Clerk , that can scarce read a Case when it is written , with his handful of papers , from one Court to another , and from one Counsellors chamber to another , when by his good payment , for his pains , he will be so saucy , as to call himself a Solicitor : But what a taking are poor Clients in , when this too much trusted cunning companion , better read in Pierce Ploughman , then in Ploydon , and in the Play of Richard the Third , then in the Pleas of Edward the Fourth ; persuades them all is sure , when he is sure of all ? and in what a misery are the poor men , when , upon a Nihil dicit , because indeed , this poor fellow , Nihil potest dicere , they are in danger of an Execution , before they know wherefore they are condemned : But , I wish all such more wicked than witty , unlearned in the Law and abusers of the same , to look a little better into their consciences , and to leave their crafty courses , lest when the Law indeed lays them open , in stead of carrying papers in their hands , they wear not papers on their heads , and in stead of giving ear to their Clients causes , or rather eyes into their purses , they have ne'er an Ear left to hear withal , nor good Eye to see withal ; or at least honest Face to look out withal : but as the Grasshoppers of Egypt , be counted the Caterpillars of England , and not the Fox that stole the Goose , but the great Fox that stole the Farm , from the Gander . 

A Worthy Soldier . 

A Worthy Soldier is the child of Valour , who was born for the service of necessity , and to bear the Ensign of Honour , in the actions of Worth : He is the Dyer of the Earth with blood , and the ruin of the erections of Pride : He is the watch of Wit , in the advantage of Time , and the executioner of Wrath upon the wilful offender : He disputes questions with the point of a Sword , and prefers Death to indignities : He is a Lion to Ambition , and a Lamb to Submission : he hath Hope fast by the hand , and treads upon the head of Fear . He is the King's Champion , and the Kingdom's Guard , Peace's preserver , and Rebellions terror : He makes the Horse trample at the sound of a Trumpet , and leads on to a battle , as if he were going to a breakfast ; he knows not the nature of Cowardice , for his rest is set up upon Resolution : his strongest fortification is his Mind , which beats off the assaults of idle humours , and his life is the passage of danger , where , an undaunted Spirit stoops to no Fortune ; with his arms he wins his Arms , and by his desert in the field , his Honour in the Court. In sum , in the truest Manhood he is the true man : and in the creation of Honour , a most worthy Creature . 

An Untrained Soldier . 

AN Untrained Soldier is like a young hound , that when the first falls to hunt , he knows not how to lay his nose to the earth : Who having his name but in a book , and marched twice about a market place , when he comes to a piece of service , knows not how to bestow himself : He marches as if he were at plough , carries his Pike like a Pikestaff , and his sword before him , for fear of losing from his side : if he be a Shot , he will be rather ready to say a Grace over his Piece , and so to discharge his hands of it , then to learn how to discharge it with a grace : he puts on his Armour over his ears , like a waistcoat , and wears his Morion like a nightcap ; when he is quartered in the field , he looks for his bed , and when he sees his Provant , he is ready to cry for his victuals ; and ere he know well where he is , wish heartily he were at home again , with hanging down his head , as if his heart were in his hose : sleep till a Drum , or a deadly bullet awake him , and so carry himself in all Companies , that till Martial Discipline have seasoned his understanding , he is like a Cipher among figures , an Owl among birds , a Wise man among fools , and a shadow among men . 

A Worthy Physician . 

A Worthy Physician is the enemy of sickness , in purging nature from corruption : his action is most in feeling of pulses , and his discourses chiefly of the natures of diseases : He is a great searcher out of simples , and accordingly makes his composition : he persuades abstinence , and patience , for the benefit of health , while purgeing and bleeding are the chief courses of his counsel : the Apothecary , and the Chirurgeon are his two chief attendants , with whom conferring upon Time , grows temperate in his cures : Surfeits , and wantonness are great agents for his employment , when by the secret of his skill , out of others weakness he gathers his own strength . In sum , he is a necessary member for an unnecessary malady , to find a disease and to cure the diseased . 

An Unworthy Physician . 

AN unlearned , and so Unworthy Physician , is a kind of Horseleech , whose cure is most in drawing of blood , and a desperate purge , either to cure , or kill , as it hits ; his discourse is most of the cures that he hath done , and them afar off : and not a receipt under a hundreth pounds , though it be not worth three halfpences : Upon the market day he is much haunted with Urinals , where if he find any thing ( though he know nothing ) yet he will say somewhat , which if it hit to some purpose , with a few fustian words , he will seem a piece of strange stuff : he is never without old merry tales , and stale jests to make old folks laugh , and Cumfits , or Plums in his pocket , to please little Children : yea , and he will be talking of complexions , though he know nothing of their dispositions : and if his medicine do a feat , he is a made man among fools : but being wholly unlearned , and ofttimes unhonest , let me thus briefly describe him : He is a plain kind of Mountebank , and a true Quacksalver , a danger for the sick to deal withal , and a Dizzard in the world to talk withal . 

A Worthy Merchant . 

A Worthy Merchant is the heir of adventure , whose hopes hang much upon wind : Upon a wooden horse he rides through the world , and in a merry Gale , makes a path through the Seas : he is a discoverer of Countries , and a finder out of commodities , resolute in his attempts , and royal in his expenses : he is the life of Traffic , and the maintainer of Trade , the Sailor's Master , and the Soldier's friend ; he is the exercise of the exchange , the honour of credit , the observation of Time , and the understanding of thrift : his study is number , his care his accounts , his comfort his Conscience , and his wealth his good Name : he fears not Silla , and sails close by Charybdis , and having beaten out a storm , rides at rest in a harbour : by his Sea gain , he makes his land-purchase , and by the knowledge of Trade , finds the key of Treasure : out of his travails , he makes his discourses , and from his eye-obseruations , brings the Models of Architectures ; he plants the earth with foreign fruits , and knows at home what is good abroad : he is neat in apparel , modest in demeanour , dainty in diet , and civil in his carriage . In sum , he is the Pillar of a City , the enricher of a Country , the furnisher of a Court , and the worthy servant of a King.  

An Unworthy Merchant . 

AN Unworthy Merchant is a kind of Pedlar , who ( with the help of a Broker ) gets more by his wit , then by his honesty : he doth sometime use to give out money to Gamesters , be paid in post , upon a hand at Dice : sometime , he gains more by Baubles , than better Stuffs , and rather than fail , will adventure a false oath for a fraudulent gain ; he deals with no whole sale , but all his honesty is at one word : as for wares and weights he knows how to hold the balance , and for his Conscience , he is not ignorant what to do with it : his travail is most by land , for he fears to be too busy with the water , and whatsoever his ware be , he will be sure of his money : the most of his wealth is in a pack of trifles , and for his honesty , I dare not pass my word for him ; if he be rich , 't is ten to one of his pride , and if he be poor , he breaks without his fast . In sum , he is the disgrace of a Merchant , the dishonour of a City , the discredit of his parish , and the dislike of all . 

A good man  

A Good man is an image of God , Lord over all his Creatures , and created only for his service : he is made capable of Reason , to know the properties of Nature , and by the inspiration of Grace , to know things supernatural : He hath a face always to look upward , and a Soul that gives life to all the Senses , he lives in the World as a Stranger , while Heaven is the home of his spirit : his life is but the labour of sense ; and his death , the way to his rest : his study is the word of Truth , and his delight is in the law of love : his provision is but to serve necessity , and his care the exercise of Charity : he is more conversant with the divine Prophets , than the world's profits , and makes the joy of his soul in the tidings of his salvation : he is wise in the best wit , and wealth in the richest treasure : his hope is but the comfort of mercy , and his fear but the hurt of sin : Pride is the hate of his soul , and Patience the worker of his peace , his Guide is the wisdom of Grace , and his travail but to the heavenly jerusalem . In sum , he is the Elect of God , the blessing of Grace , the seed of love , and the fruit of life . 

An Atheist , or most bad man  

AN Atheist is a figure of desperation , who dare do any thing even to his soul's damnation : he is in nature a Dog , in wit an Ass , in passion a Bedlam , and in action a Devil : He makes Sin a jest , Grace an humour , Truth a fable , and Peace a Cowardice : his Horse is his pride , his Sword is his Castle , his Apparel his riches , and his Punk his Paradise : he makes Robbery his purchase , Lechery his Solace , Mirth his Exercise , and Drunkenness his Glory : he is the danger of Society , the love of Vanity , the hate of Charity , and the shame of Humanity : he is God's enemy , his Parent's grief , his Country's plague , and his own confusion ; he spoils that is necessary , and spends that is needless ; he spites at the Gracious , and spurns at the Godly : the Tavern is his Palace , & his belly is his God , a Whore is his Mistress , and the Devil is his Master : Oaths are his Graces , Wounds his Badges ; Shifts are his practices , and beggary his payments : He knows not GOD , nor thinks of Heaven , but walks thorough the world , as a Devil towards Hell : Virtue knows him not , Honesty finds him not , Wisdom loves him not , and Honour regards him not : he is but the Cutler's friend , and the Surgeons Agent , the Thief's Companion , and the Hangman's Benefactor : he was begotten untimely , and born unhappily , lives ungraciously , and dies unchristianly : He is of no Religion , nor good fashion , hardly good complexion , & most vile in condition . In sum , he is a Monster among men , a jew among Christians , a fool among Wisemen , and a devil among Saints . 

A Wise man  

A Wise man , is a Clock that never strikes but at his hour , or rather like a Dial , that being set right with the Sun , keeps his true course in his compass . So the heart of a Wise man , set in the course of Virtue by the spirit of Grace , runs the course of life , in the compass of eternal comfort : He measureth Time , and tempreth Nature , employeth Reason , and commands Sense : He hath a deaf Ear to the Charmer , a close mouth to the Slanderer , an open hand to Charity , and an humble mind to Piety : Observation and experience are his reasons labours , and Patience with Conscience are the lines of his Love's measure , Contemplation , and Meditation are his Spirits exercise , and GOD and his Word are the joy of his Soul : He knows not the Pride of Prosperity , nor the misery of Adversity , but takes the one as the Day , the other as the Night : He knows no Fortune , but builds all upon providence , and through the hope of Faith , hath a fair aim at Heaven : His words are weighed with judgement , and , his Actions are the examples of Honour : He is fit for the seat of Authority , and deserves the reverence of Subjection : He is precious in the counsel of a King , and mighty in the sway of a Kingdom . In sum , he is God's servant , and the World's Master , a stranger upon Earth , and a Citizen in Heaven . 

A Foole.  

A Fool is the Abortive of wit , where Nature had more power than Reason , in bringing forth the fruit of imperfection , his actions are most in extremes , and the scope of his brain is but Ignorance : only Nature hath taught him to feed , and Use , to labour without knowledge : He is a kind of shadow of a better substance , or , like the Vision of a Dream , that yields nothing awake : he is commonly known by one of two special Names , derived from their qualities , as , from wilful Willfoole , and Hodge from Hodgepodge ; all meats are alike , all are one to a Fool : His exercises are commonly divided into four parts , Eating and Drinking , Sleeping and Laughing : four things are his chief Loves : a Bauble , and a Bell , a Coxcomb , and a Pide-coate : He was begotten in unhappiness , born to no goodness , lives but in beastliness , and dies but in forgetfulness . In sum , he is the shame of Nature , the trouble of Wit , the charge of Charity , and the loss of Liberality . 

An Honest man  

AN Honest man is like a plain Coat , which , without welt or guard , keepeth the body from wind and weather , and being well made , fits him best that wears it ; and where the stuff is more regarded than the fashion , there is not much ado in the putting of it on : so , the mind of an Honest man without tricks or compliments , keeps the credit of a good Conscience from the scandal of the World , and the worm of Iniquity : which , being wrought , by the Workman of Heaven , fits him best that wears it to his service : and , where Virtue is more esteemed than Vanity , it is put on , and worn with that ease , that shows the excellency of the Workman : His study is Virtue , his word Truth , his life the passage of Patience , and his death the rest of his Spirit : His travail is a Pilgrimage , his way is plainness , his pleasure Peace , and his delight is Love : His care is his Conscience , his wealth is his credit , his charge is his Charity , and his content is his Kingdom . In sum , he is a Diamond among jewels , a Phoenix among Birds , an Unicorn among Beasts , and a Saint among men . 

A Knave . 

A Knave is the scum of Wit , and the scorn of Reason , the hate of Wisdom , and the dishonour of Humanity : He is the danger of Society , and the hurt of Amity , the infection of Youth , and the corruption of Age : He is a Traitor to Affiance , and abuse to employment , and a rule of Villainy , in a plot of mischief : He hath a Cat's eye , and a Bear's paw , a Sirens tongue , and a Serpent's sting : His Words are lies , his Oaths perjuries , his Studies subtleties , and his practices Villainies , his Wealth is his wit , his Honour is his wealth , his Glory is his gain , and his god is his Gold : He is no man's friend , and his own enemy , cursed on Earth , and banished from Heaven : He was begotten ungraciously , born untimely , lives dishonestly , and dies shamefully : His heart is a puddle of Poison , his Tongue a sting of iniquity , his Brain a distiller of deceit , and his Conscience a compass of Hell. In sum , he is a Dog in disposition , a Fox in wit , a Wolf in his prey , and a Devil in his Pride . 

An Usurer . 

AN Usurer is a figure of Misery , who hath made himself a slave to his Money : His Eye is closed from pity , and his hand from Charity , his Ear from compassion , and his heart from Piety : while he lives , he is the hate of a Christian , and , when he dies , he goes with horror to hell : His study is sparing , and his care is getting , his fear is wanting , and his death is losing : His Diet is either fasting , or poor fare , his Clothing the Hangman's wordrobe , his house the receptacle of Thievery , and his Music the chinking of his Money : He is a kind of Canker , that with the teeth of Interest , eats the hearts of the poor , and a venomous Fly , that sucks out the blood of any flesh that he lights on . In sum , he is a servant of dross , a slave to Misery , an Agent for Hell , and a Devil in the World.  

A Beggar . 

A Beggar is the child of Idleness , whose life is a resolution of ease , his travail is most in the Highways , and his Randevows is commonly in an Alehouse : His study is to sergeant Impotency , and his practice , to cozen simplicity of Charity , the juice of the Malt is the liquour of his life , and at bed , and at board a Louse is his companion : He fears no such enemy , as a Constable , and , being acquainted with the stocks , must visit them , as he goes by them : He is a Drone that feeds upon the labours of the Bee , and unhappily begotten , that is born for no goodness ; his staff and his scrip are his walking furniture , and what he lacks in meat , he will have out in drink : He is a kind of Caterpillar that spoils much good fruit , and an unprofitable creature to live in a commonwealth : He is seldom handsome , and often noisome , always troublesome , and never welcome : he prays for all , and preys upon all , begins with blessing , but ends often with cursing : if he have a Licence , he shows it with a grace , but if he have none , he is submissive to the ground : sometime he is a Thief , but , always a Rogue , and in the nature of his profession , the shame of Humanity . In sum , he is commonly begot in a Bush , born in a Barn , lives in a Highway , and dies in a Ditch . 

A Virgin.  

A Virgin is the beauty of Nature , where the Spirit gracious makes the creature Glorious : She is the love of Virtue , the honour of Reason , the grace of Youth , and the comfort of Age : Her study is Holiness , her exercise Goodness , her grace Humility , and her love is Charity : her countenance is Modesty ; her speech is Truth , her wealth Grace , and her fame Constancy : her virtue Continence , her labour Patience , her diet Abstinence , and her care Conscience : Her conversation Heavenly , her meditations Angellike , her prayers Devout , and her hopes Divine : Her parent's joy , her kindred's Honour , her country's Fame , and her own Felicity : She is the blessed of the Highest , the praise of the Worthiest , the love of the Noblest , and the nearest to the Best : She is of creatures the Rarest , of Women the Chiefest , of nature the Purest , and of Wisdom the Choicest . Her life is a Pilgrimage , her death but a Passage , her description a Wonder , and her name an Honour . In sum , she is the daughter of Glory , the mother of Grace , the sister of Love , and the beloved of Life . 

A wanton Woman . 

A Wanton Woman is the figure of Imperfection , in nature , an Ape , in quality , a Wagtail , in countenance , a Witch , and in condition , a kind of Devil : her beck is a net , her word a charm , her look an illusion , and her company a confusion : her life is the play of idleness , her diet the excess of dainties , her love the change of vanities , and her exercise the invention of follies : her pleasures are fancies , her studies fashions , her delight colours , and her wealth her clothes : her care is to deceive , her comfort her Company , her house is vanity , and her Bed is ruin , her discourses are fables , her vows , dissimulations , her conceits subtleties , and her contents varieties : She would she knows not what , and spends she cares not what , she spoils she sees not what , and doth she thinks not what : She is Youth's plague , and Ages Purgatory , Time's abuse , and Reasons trouble . In sum , she is a spice of madness , a spark of mischief , a touch of poison , and a fear of destruction . 

A quiet Woman . 

A Quiet woman is like a still wind , which neither chills the body , nor blows dust in the face : her Patience is a Virtue that wins the heart of love , and her wisdom makes her will well worthy regard : She fears God , and flieth sin , showeth kindness and loveth peace : her tongue is tied to discretion , and her heart is the harbour of goodness : She is acomfort of Calamity , and in prosperity a companion , a Physician in sickness , and a Musician in help : her ways are the walk toward heaven , and her Guide is the Grace of the Almighty : She is her husband's Downbed , where his heart lies at rest , and her children's Glass in the notes of her Grace , her servant's honour in the keeping of her house , and her neighbour's example in the notes of a good nature : She skorns Fortune , and love's Virtue , and out of thrift gathereth Charity : she is a Turtle in her love , a Lamb in her meekness , a Saint in her heart , and an Angel in her soul . In sum , she is a jewel unprizeable , and a joy unspeakable , a comfort in Nature incomparable , and a Wife in the world unmatchable . 

An Unquiet Woman . 

AN Unquiet Woman is the misery of man , whose demeanour is not to be described , but in extremities : her voice is the skrieching of an Owl , her eye the poison of a Cockatrice , her hand the claw of a Crocodile , and her heart a Cabinet of horror : She is the grief of Nature , the wound of Wit , the trouble of Reason , and the abuse of time : her pride is unsupportable , her anger unquenchable , her will unsatiable , and her malice unmatchable : She fears no colours , she cares for no counsel , she spares no persons , nor respects any time ; her command is Must , her Reason Will , her Resolution Shall , and her satisfaction So : She looks at no law , and thinks of no Lord , admits no command , and keeps no good order : She is a cross , but not of Christ , and a word , but not of Grace , a creature , but not of wisdom , and a servant , but not of God. In sum , she is the seed of trouble , the fruit of travail , the taste of bitterness , and the digestion of death . 

A good Wife . 

A Good Wife is a world of wealth , where just cause of content makes a kingdom in conceit : She is the eye of wariness , the tongue of silence , the hand of labour , and the heart of love : a companion of kindness , a Mistress of Passion , an exercise of Patience , and an example of experience : She is the Kitchen Physician , the Chamber comfort , the Hall's care , and the Parlours Grace : She is the Dairies neatness , the Brue-house wholsomnesse , the Garners provision , and the Gardens plantation : her voice is music , her countenance meekness , her mind virtuous , and her soul gracious : she is her Husband's jewel , her children's joy , her Neighbour's love , and her servant's honour ; she is Poverties prayer , and Charity's praise , Religion's love , and Devotions zeal : she is a care of necessity , and a course of Thrift , a book of Housewifery , and a mirror of modesty . In sum , she is God's blessing , and Man's happiness , Earth's honour , and Heaven's creature . 

An Effeminate Foole.  

AN Effeminate fool is the figure of a Baby ; he loves nothing but gay , to look in a Glass , to keep among Wenches , and , to play with trifles : to feed on sweet meats , and to be danced in Laps , to be embraced in Arms , and to be kissed on the Cheek : To talk Idly , to look demurely , to go Nicely , and to Laugh continually : To be his Mistress servant , and her Maid's master , his Father's Love , and his Mother's none-child ; to play on a Fiddle , and sing a Lovesong , to wear sweet Gloves , and look on fine things : To make purposes , and write Verses , device Riddles , and tell lies : To follow Plays , and study Dances , to hear News , and buy trifles : To sigh for Love , and weep for kindness , and mourn for company , and be sick for fashion : To ride in a Coach , and gallop a Hackney , to watch all Night , and sleep out the Morning : to lie on a bed , and take Tobacco , and to send his Page of an idle message to his Mistress : to go upon Gigges , to have his Ruffs set in print , to pick his Teeth , and play with a Puppet . In sum , he is a man-child , and a Woman's man , a gaze of Folly , and Wisdom's grief . 

A Parasite . 

A Parisite is the Image of iniquity , who for the gain of dross , is devoted to all villainy : He is a kind of Thief , in committing of Burglary , when he breaks into houses with his tongue , and picks pockets with his flattery : his face is brazed that he cannot blush , and his hands are limed to catch hold what he can light on : his tongue is a Bell ( but not of the Church , except it be the Devils ) to call his Parish to his service : he is sometime a Pander to carry messages of ill meetings , and perhaps hath some Eloquence to persuade sweetness in sin : he is like a dog at a door , while the devils dance in the chamber , or like a Spider in the house top , that lives on the poison below : he is the hate of honesty , and the abuse of beauty , the spoil of Youth , and the misery of Age. In sum , he is a danger in a Court , a Cheater in a City , a jester in the Country , and a jacke-an-apes in all . 

A Bawd . 

A Bawd is a kind of Woman-beast , who having lost the honour of her Virginity in her youth , means to go to hell in her Age : She is dangerous among young people , for fear of the infection of the falling sickness , and not to teach children to spell , lest she learn them too soon to put together : she is partly a Surgeon , but most for the the allaying of swellings in the lower parts , and hath commonly a charm to conjure the Devil into hell : She grieves at nothing more , then at disability to sin , and is never so merry , as when she is persuaded to be young : she fears nothing more than the Cart , and cares for nothing but ease , and loves a cup of Sack and a pot of Ale , almost as well as the hope of her salvation : she is much subject to sore eyes , and ill teeth , with sitting up late , and feeding on sweet things : she is a Gossip at a Childbirth , where , her mirth is a bawdy tale ; and a Matron in an Hospital , to see young wenches well set to work . In sum , she is the loathsomenesse of Nature , the hate of Virtue , the spoil of wealth , and the ruin of Maidenheads . 

A Drunkard . 

A Drunkard is a Noun adjective , for he cannot stand alone by himself ; yet in his greatest we aknesse , a great trier of strength , whether health or sickness will have the upper hand in a surfeit : He is a spectacle of deformity , and a shame of humanity , a view of sin , and a grief of Nature : he is the anoiance of Modesty , and the trouble of Civility , the spoil of wealth , and the spite of Reason : he is only the Brewer's Agent , and the Alehouse Benefactor , the Beggar's Companion , and the Constable's trouble : he is his Wife's woe , his children's sorrow , his Neighbour's scoff , and his own shame . In sum , he is a Tub of swill , a Spirit of sleep , a picture of a Beast , and a Monster of a man  

A Coward . 

A Coward is the child of fear , he was begotten in cold blood , when Nature had much ado to make up a Creature like a man : his life is a kind of sickness , which breeds a kind of palsy in the joints , and his death the terror of his conscience , with the extreme weakness of his faith : he loves Peace as his life , for he fears a sword in his soul : if he cut his finger , he looketh presently for the sign , and if his head ache , he is ready to make his will : a report of a cannon strikes him flat on his face , and a clap of thunder makes him a strange Metamorphosis : rather than he will fight , he will be beaten , and if his legs will help him , he will put his arms to no trouble : he makes love commonly with his purse , and brags most of his Maidenhead , he will not marry but into a quiet family , and not too fair a wife , to avoid quarrels : if his wife frown upon him , he sighs , and if she give him an unkind word , he weeps : he loves not the horns of a Bull , nor the paws of a Bear : and if a dog bark , he will not come near the house : if he be rich , he is afraid of thieves , and if he be poor he will be slave to a Beggar . In sum , he is the shame of manhood , the disgrace of Nature , the scorn of Reason , and the hate of honour . 

An honest Poor man  

AN honest Poor man is the proof of misery , where patience is put to the trial of her strength to endure grief without passion , in starving with concealed necessity , or standing in the adventures of Charity : if he be married , Want rings in his ears , and woe watreth his eyes : if single , he droopeth with the shame of Beggary , or dies with the passion of penury : of the Rich , he is shunned like infection , and of the poor learns but a heart-breaking profession : his bed is the earth , and the heaven is his Canapy , the Sun is his Summer's comfort , and the Moon is his Winter candle : his sighs are the notes of his music , and his Song is like the Swan before her death : his study , his patience , and his exercise prayer ; his diet , the herbs of the earth , and his drink , the water of the River : his travel is the walk of the woeful , and his horse Bayard of ten-toes : his apparel but the clothing of nakedness , and his wealth but the hope of heaven : He is a stranger in the world , for no man craves his acquaintance , & his funeral is without Ceremony , when there is no mourning for the miss of him : yet may he be in the state of Election , and in the life of love , and more rich in Grace , than the greatest of the World. In sum , he is the grief of Nature , the sorrow of Reason , the pity of wisdom , and the charge of Charity . 

A Just man  

A Just man is the Child of Truth , begotten by virtue and kindness , when Nature in the temper of the spirit , made even the balance of Indifferency : his eye is clear from blindness , and his hand from Bribery , his will from wilfulness , and his heart from wickedness : his word and deed are all one , his life shows the nature of his love , his care is the charge of his Conscience , and his comfort , the assurance of his Salvation : In the Seat of justice , he is the grace of the Law , and in the judgement of Right , the honour of Reason : he fears not the power of Authority to equal justice with Mercy , and joys but in the judgement of Grace , to see the execution of justice : his judgement is worthy of honour , and his Wisdom is gracious in Truth : his Honour is famous in Virtue , and his Virtue is precious in Example . In sum , he is a spirit of Understanding , a brain of Knowledge , a heart of Wisdom , and a Soul of Blessedness . 

A Repentant Sinner . 

A Repentant Sinner is the Child of Grace , who being born for the service of God , makes no reckoning of the mastershippe of the world , yet , doth he glorify God in the beholding of his creatures , and in giving praise to his holy Name , in the admiration of his Work-manship : He is much of the nature of an Angel , who being sent into the world but to do the will of his Master , is ever longing to be at home with his fellows : He desire's nothing but that is necessary , and delighteth in nothing that is transitory , but contemplates more than he can conceive , and meditates only upon the Word of the Almighty ; his Senses are the tyrers of his Spirit , while , in the course of nature , his Soul can find no rest : He shakes off the rags of Sin , and is clothed with the Robe of Virtue : he puts off Adam , and puts on Christ : His heart is the Anvile of Truth , where the brain of his Wisdom beats the thoughts of his Mind , till they be fit for the service of his Maker : His labour is the travail of Love , by the rule of Grace to find the highway to Heaven : His fear is greater than his Love of the World , and his Love is greater than his fear of God. In sum , he is in the Election of Love , in the book of Life , an Angel incarnate , and a blessed Creature . 

A Reprobate . 

A Reprobate is the Child of sin , who being born for the service of the Devil , cares not what villainy he does in the world : His wit is always in a maze , for his courses are ever out of order , and while his will stands for his wisdom , the best that falls out of him , is a Fool : He betrays the trust of the simple , and sucks out the blood of the Innocent . His breath is the fume of Blasphemy , and his Tongue the firebrand of Hell : His desires are the destruction of the Virtuous , and his delights are the Traps to damnation : He baths in the blood of Murder , and sups up the broth of Iniquity : He frighteth the Eyes of the Godly , & disturbeth the hearts of the Religious : he marreth the wits of the Wise , and is hateful to the Souls of the Gracious . In sum , he is an inhuman Creature , a fearful Companion , a man-monster , and a Devil incarnate . 

An Old man  

AN Old man is the declaration of Time , in the defect of nature , and the imperfection of sense in the use of Reason : He is in the observation of Time , a Calendar of experience , but in the power of Action , he is a blank among Lots : He is the subject of weakness , the Agent of sickness , the displeasure of life , and the forerunner of death : He is twice a Child , and half a man , a living Picture , and a dying Creature : he is a blown Bladder , that is only stuffed with wind , and a withered Tree , that hath lost the sap of the Root : or an old Lute with strings all broken , or a ruined Castle that is ready to fall : He is the eyesore of Youth , and the jest of Love , and in the fullness of Infirmity , the Mirror of Misery . Yet , in the honour of Wisdom , he may be Gracious in Gravity , and in the government of justice , deserve the Honour of Reverence : Yea , his Words may be notes for the use of Reason , and his Actions examples for the imitation of discretion . In sum , in whatsoever estate , he is but as the snuff of a Candle , that pink it never so long , it will out at last . 

A Young man  

A Young man is the Spring of Time , when Nature in her Pride shows her Beauty to the World : He is the delight of the Eye , and the study of the mind , the labour of instruction , and the Pupil of Reason : His Wit is in making or marring , his Wealth in gaining or losing , his Honour in advancing or declining , and his Life in abridging or increasing : He is a Bloome , that either is blasted in the Bud , or grows to a good fruit , or a Bird that dies in the nest , or lives to make use of her wings : He is a Colt that must have a Bridle , ere he be well managed , and a Falcon that must be well maned , or he will never be reclaimed : He is the Darling of Nature , and the charge of Reason , the exercise of Patience , and the hope of Charity : His exercise is either Study or Action , and his study either Knowledge or Pleasure : His disposition gives a great note of his generation , and yet , his breeding may either better or worse him , though to wish a Black-moore white , be the loss of labour , and what is bred in the bone , will never out of the flesh . In sum , till experience have seasoned his Understanding , he is rather a Child then a man , a prey of flattery , or a praise of providence , in the way of Grace , to prove a Saint , or in the way of sin , to grow a Devil . 

A Holy man  

A Holy man is the chiefest Creature in the workmanship of the World : He is the highest in the Election of Love , and the nearest to the Image of the human Nature of his Maker : He is served of all the creatures in the Earth , and created but for the service of his Creator : He is capable of the course of Nature , and by the rule of Observation , finds the Art of Reason ; his senses are but servants to his Spirit , which is guided by a power above himself : his Time is only known to the Eye of the Almighty , and what he is in his most greatness , is as nothing , but in his Mercy : He makes Law by the direction of life , and lives but in the mercy of Love : he treads upon the face of the Earth , till in the same substance he be trod upon , though his Soul that gave life to his senses , live in Heaven , till the resurrection of his flesh : He hath an Eye to look upward towards Grace , while Labour is only the punishment of sin : his Faith is the hand of his Soul , which layeth hold on the promise of Mercy : his Patience , the Tenure of the possession of his Soul , his Charity , the rule of his life , and his hope , the Anchor of his Salvation : His study is the state of Obedience , and his exercise the continuance of Prayer ; his life but a passage to a better , and his death , the rest of his labours : His heart is a watch to his Eye , his wit , a door to his Mouth , his Soul , a guard to his Spirit , and his Limbs , but labourers for his Body . In sum , he is ravished with Divine Love , hateful to the nature of Sin , troubled with the Vanities of the World , and longing for his joy but in Heaven . 

FINIS .
