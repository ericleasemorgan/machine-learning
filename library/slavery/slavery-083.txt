The grand cheat cried up underhand by many in the factious and giddy part of the army ; and greedily swallowed down by many persons that do not discern the poison and danger thereof ; in several particulars , as followeth . 

by one that was a member of the army whilst they were obedient to authority . First , if you accept a free parliament , as the case now standeth , you conclude the army to be supreme ; than which nothing is more dangerous : for that the first question that would be moved in a free parliament , will be , how the nation shall be governed ? It is easily to be resolved , what would be the resolution in a free parliament , that is to say , a King . this will be the way and means to keep the nation in perpetual slavery ; for that the difference between the honest part of the army now under monk in Scotland , and elsewhere ; and the disobedient officers of the army , who usurp the erecting a government , and the giving their military sanction : the honest part of the army , they desire that the settlement of the nation May be from a civil power ; therefore they endeavour , that the parliament lately interrupted , May again return to the exercise of their authority : for several reasons ; the chief of which are , this parliament , although they are under the evil aspect of a great part of the nation ; yet , let it be duly considered , and it will be found , that the reasons for which the nation doth so much disrespect them , is , for that they were for the most part overruled , and their counsels were influenced by the factious and disobedient part of the army ; so that they never could accomplish the good they declared for , or intended to the public . But now the case is far different , of which they have given ample testimony , in their endeavouring to bring the army to their duty and obedience ( In their last sitting ) ; so that as formerly they did adhere to the army against the public interest out of necessity ; now they must adhere to the interest of the public , against the interest of the factious and disobedient part of the army , that have been the cause of all the unquiet , unsettlement , and changes that have been of late years produced , to the detriment of the public : and unless the army be purged of them , they will be the authors and abettors of more changes , to the ruin of all . 

Therefore it is the interest of the nation to expect settlement by succession of parliaments , conveyed to posterity by their authority : a free parliament , 't is true , will please most of persons ; yet if they shall receive a free parliament from the army , or by their permission , the authority of the army is then , and thereby , granted and concluded to be supreme . If so , then how will posterity be bound to curse us , if we do submit to such a snare and bait as that will prove in the issue ? 

Likewise , if the nation doth submit to any kind of government , that shall be instituted by the army , let it be a free parliament or a parliament under qualifications , still the case is the same ; you receive your laws from the sword , and make the army the legislators , for which power no balance can be found : so that they will run into all extremes of tyranny and uncertainty , which are equally dangerous with the worst of mischiefs . 

If they permit a free parliament , than they will quarrel with them , and turn them out of doors for adhering to a King or single person : if they give you a parliament under qualifications , than they will be the interpreters of those qualifications , and so often as the parliaments so qualified , shall not keep tune to their lusts , pride , and ambition ; so often shall the nation be bereaved of parliaments : so that if that the parliament now in being , by virtue of that act that maketh them no less than a parliament , until they shall dissolve themselves : do not settle your government , and establish a law for succession of parliaments . The army will be your supreme authority and standard to your liberties , to measure out to you what liberty or slavery they please : as the case standeth , it appeareth to be nothing less than madness , that persons should be contented to submit to a proud insolent army , rather than to this parliament , if they cannot have a free parliament ; but some May say , that the sheriffs May elect a parliament , by virtue of the act for tryenial parliaments , to that i answer , than you make the sheriffs to be the supreme authority , or else him or them , that shall appoint the time for their convention , that proviso was made in respect to an orderly convening and determination , which is discomposed by the many and various events of affairs that hath happened amongst us ; the which , must be set right by the again sitting of the parliament , the which , is the interest of every individual Englishman ; without which , every interest in the nation will be destroyed by an ignorant and unskilful , proud malicious , and insolent pack of giddy fellows ; who will adventure to change the government of three nations upon half an hours consideration : the effect of their ambition , and then say God led them to it . If these persons be fit to fit at the helm of affair ? Let the world judge . 

If it were so , that the insignificant general council of legislating corporals and landsprizadoes could hit upon the best form of government under heaven , ( A thing impossible for them , to do any thing else than what shall be nonsense itself , above which their capacities cannot reach , ) it would be dangerous to receive it from them , for that those that have absolute power to do good , have also absolute power to do evil ; and the nation can expect no assurance to the contrary from them , but from such a power as are limited by time , or otherwise they May . 

This parliament is already limited to May the 6th . as to time , and are more especially limited by interest , which will not , nor cannot support them in power beyond that time : so that by this means , whatever the nation can expect by succession of parliaments , will be conveyed to them , without running the hazard of trusting a perfidious army . 

Finis .
