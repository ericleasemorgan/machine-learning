Printed in the year , 1649.  

An appeal to the house of Commons , desiring their answer ; whether the common-people shall have the quiet enjoyment of the Commons and waste lands : or whether they shall be under the will of Lords of manors still . 

Sirs , 

The cause of this our presentment before you , is , an appeal to you , desiring you to demonstrate to us , and the whole land , the equity , or not equity of our cause ; and that you would either cast us by just reason under the feet of those we call taskmasters , or Lords of manors , or else to deliver us out of their tyrannical hands : in whose hands , by way of arrest , we are for the present , for a trespass to them , as they say , in digging upon the common-land . The settling whereof , according to equity and reason , will quiet the minds of the oppressed persons ; it will be a keeping of our national covenant ; it will be peace to yourselves , and make England the most flourishing , and strongest land in the 〈◊〉 and the first of nations that shall begin to give up their crown and sceptre , their dominion and government into the hands of Jesus Christ . 

The cause is this , we , amongst others of the common peopl•• that have been ever friends to the parliament , as we are 〈◊〉 red our enemies will witness to it , have ploughed and diged upon George's hill in Surrey , to sow corn for the succour of man , offering no offence to any , but do carry ourselves in love and peace towards all having no intent to meddle with any man's enclosures , or propriety , till it be freely given to us by themselves , but only to improve the Commons and waste lands to our best advantage , for the relief of ourselves and others , being moved thereunto by the reason hereafter following , not expecting any to be much offended , in regard the cause is so just and upright . 

Yet notwithstanding , there be three men ( Called by the persons Lords of manors ) viz. Thomas Lord Wenman , Ralph Ve•ny knight , and Richard Winwood esquire , have arrested 〈◊〉 for a trespass in digging upon the Commons , and upon the arrest we made our appearance in Kingston court , where we understood we were arrested for meddling with other men's rights ; and secondly , they were encouraged to arrest us upon your act of parliament ( As they tell us ) to maintain the old laws ; we desired to plead our own cause , the court denied us ▪ and to fee a lawyer we cannot , for divers reasons , as we May show hereafter . 

Now Sirs , our case is this , for we appeal to you , for you are the only men that we are to deal withal in this business ▪ whether the common persons , after all their taxes , freequarter , and loss of blood to recover England from under the Norman yoke shall have the freedom to improve the comon• , and waste lands free to themselves , as freely their own , as the enclosures are the propriety of the elder brothers ? Or whether the Lords of manors shall have them , according to their old custom from the King's will and grant , and so remain taskmasters still over us which 〈◊〉 the people's slavery 〈◊〉 conquest . 

We have made our appeal 〈◊〉 , to settle this matter in the equity and reason of it , and to pass the sentence of freedom to us you being the men with whom we have to do in this business , in whose hands there is power to settle it , for no court can end this controversy ▪ but your court of parliament , as the case of this nation now stands . 

Therefore we 〈◊〉 you to read over this following declaration , wherein we have declared our reason , that the Commons and waste lands is the common peoples , and that in equity you ought to let them quietly enjoy them , as the elder brothers quietly enjoy their enclosures . The profit of this business to the nation , the quitting of the hearts of the poor oppressed that are groaning under burdens and straits and the peace of your own hearts , to see the pear of the nation settled in his platform , will much countervail the spending of so much time . 

Sirs , you know , that the land of England in the land of our nativity , both yours and ours , and all of us by the righteous law of our creation , aught to have food and raiment freely by our righteous labouring of the earth , without working for hire , or paying rent one to another . 

But since the fall of man from that righteous law . The nations of the world have rise up in variance one against another , and sought against murdered , and stolen the land of their nativity one from another , and by their power of their conquests , have 〈◊〉 set up some to rule in tyranny over others , and thereby have enslaved the conquered , which is a burden the whole creation hath , and yet does groan under . The teeth of all nations hath been set on edge by this four grape , the covetous murdering sword . 

England , you know , hath been conquered and enslaved divers times , and the best laws that England hath , ( Viz. magna charta ) were got by our forefathers importunate petitioning unto the Kings , that still were their taskmasters ; and yet these best laws are yokes and manacles , tying one sort of persons to be slaves to another ; clergy and gentry have 〈◊〉 their freedom , but the common persons still are , and have been left servants to work for 〈◊〉 like the israilites under the Egyptian task Masters . 

The last enslaving yoke that England groaned under , ( And yet is not freed from ) was the Norman , as you know ; and since William the conqueror came in , about six hundred years ago , all the Kings that still succeeded , did confirm the old laws ▪ or else make new ones , to uphold that Norman conquest over us ; and the most favouring laws that we have , doth still bind the hands of the enslaved English from enjoying the freedom of their creation . 

You of the gentry , as well as we of the com , all groaned under the burden of the bad government , and burdening laws under the late King Charles , who was the last successor of William the conqueror : you and we cried for a parliament , and a parliament was called , and wars , you know , presently begun , between the King , that represented William the conqueror , and the body of the English persons that were enslaved . 

We looked upon you to be our chief council , to agitate business for us , though you were summoned by the King's writ , and chosen by the freeholders , that are the successors of William the conqueror's soldiers ; you saw the danger so great , that without a war England was like to be more enslaved , therefore you called upon us to assist you with plate , 〈◊〉 , freequarter , and our persons ; and you promised us , in the name of the almighty , to make us a free persons ; 〈◊〉 on you and we took the national covenant with joint consent , to endeavour the freedom , peace and safety of the persons of England . 

And you and we joined purse and person together in this common cause ; and will the conqueror's successor , which was Charles , was cast out ; and thereby we have recovered ourselves from under that Norman yoke ; and now unless you and we be merely besotted with covetousness , pride , and slavish fear of men , it is , and will be our wisdom to cast out all those enslaving laws , which was the tyrannical power that the 〈◊〉 •rest as down by : oh shut not your eyes against the light , darken nor knowledge , by dispute about 〈◊〉 men's privileges , when universal freedom is brought to be tried before you , dispute no further when truth appears , but be silent , and practise it . 

Stop not your ears against the secret mourning of the oppressed , under these expressions , lest the Lord see it , and be offended , and shut his ears against your cries , and work a deliverance for his waiting persons some other way then by you . 

The main thing that you should look upon is the land , which calls upon her children to be freed from the entanglement of the Norman taskmasters , for one third part lies waste and barren , and her children starve for want , in regard the Lords of manors will not suffer the poor to manure it . 

When William the conqueror came in , he took the land from the English , both the enclosures from the gentry , and the Commons and waste lands from the common persons , and gave our land to his Norman soldiers . 

Therefore seeing we have with joint consent of purse and person conquered his successor , Charles , and the power now is in your hand , the nations representative ; oh let the first thing you do , be this , to set the land free . Let the gentry have their enclosures free from all Norman enslaving entanglements whatsoever , and let the common persons have their Commons and waste lands set free to them , from all Norman enslaving Lords of manors , that so both elder and younger brother , as we spring successively one from another , May live free and quiet one by , and with another , not burdening one another in this land of our nativity . 

And this thing you are bound to see done , or at least to endeavour it , before another representative succeed you ; otherwise you cannot discharge your trust to God and man , for these reasons , 

First , if you free not the land from entanglement of all Norman yokes , or ••ther bondages , so that the persons 〈◊〉 well as another May enjoy the benefit of their  to have the land free to work upon , that they May eat their bread in righteousness ; that is to say , let the freeholders have there freedom to work quietly in their enclosures , and let the common persons have their Commons and waste lands 〈◊〉 to themselves . If you establish not this seeing power now is in your hand , you will be the first that break covenant with almighty God . 

For you swore in your national covenant to endeavour a reformation according to the word of God , which reformation is to restore us to that primitive freedom in the earth , in which the earth was first made and given to the sons of men , and that is to be a common treasury of livelihood to all , without working for hire , or paying rent to any , for this is the reformation according to the word of God before the fall of man , in which there is no respect of persons . 

And seeing in particular you swore to endeavour the freedom , peace and safety of this persons of England , shutting out no sort from freedom ; therefore you cannot say that the gentry and clergy were only comprehended , but without exception , all sorts of persons in the land are to have freedom , seeing all sorts have assisted you in person and purse , and the common persons more especially , seeing their estates were weakest , and their misery in the wars the greatest . 

Therefore let the gentry and freeholders have their enclosures freed from all entanglements of fines , heriots and other burdens , and let the common persons have their Commons and waste lands freed from entanglements of the Norman Lords of manors , and pluck up all Norman tyranny by the roots , and so keep your covenant that you , and all 〈◊〉 of persons May live in peace one among another . 

Secondly , if this freedom be not granted quietly , you will pull the blood and cries of the poor oppressed upon heads ; first , because you have taken their money in taxes , and freequarter from them , whereby they are made worse able to live then before the wars . Secondly , because in your low estate , when you called upon us to come and help a bleeding dying nation , and we did come with purse and person , and underwent great hardship , and you still promised us freedom in the end , if in case you and we prevailed over the Norman successor , and we have prevailed . 

And if now , while the price is in your hand , you should still leave us under the Norman Lords of manors , and will not quietly suffer us to plant ourselves upon the Commons , and waste land , which is ours by the law of our creation , and which is ours now by conquest from under our oppressor , for which we have paid taxes , given freequarter , and adventured our lives ; the common-land now is as freely the common peoples , as you can say the enclosures are your propriety . 

If you deny this freedom , than you justly pull the blood and cries of the poor oppressed upon you , and are covenant-breakers , and will be proved double hypocrites : first , to almighty God , in breaking covenant with him , for in his name you made the covenant . Secondly , to men , in breaking covenant with them , for the matter of the covenant was the freedom , peace , and safety of the persons of England , taking in all sorts of persons . 

Thirdly , if you do not set us free from the Norman yoke , now after you have taken our taxes and freequarter from us , whereby we have dearly bought our freedom , and you thereupon promised freedom , and you have power now to give it , for if you speak the word the Norman yokes will be broke , and all sorts will rejoice in freedom and righteousness ; but if you will not , you give a just occasion to the common persons of England , never to trust the fair words of a parliament any more , as you were always very slow in trusting the King , when he swore by the word of a King , because you found that subtlety and self lay under , and no reality . 

And truly the hearts of persons are much falling from you , for your breach of promises when you have power to keep them , and for your neglect of giving them their freedom , and removing burdens ; and what danger May ensue by that to yourselves , and the nations , you know how to judge ; and for our parts we are sorry to hear the muttering of the persons against you . 

Oh that there were a heart in you to consider of these things , and act righteousness , how sweetly Might you and the persons live together : if you grant this freedom we speak of , you gain the hearts of the nation ; if you neglect this , you will fall as fast in their affections as ever you rise : i speak what i see , and do you observe ; slight not that love that speaks feelingly , from the sense of the nations burdens . 

Fourthly , if still you should establish the old Norman laws , and confirm Lords of manors in their ancient custom , and oppressing power over the common-people , you would now at length , after the wars with King Charles are over , take part with such ( As is known very well ) as have been either flat enemies , or ambidexters all along the wars , and will cast such as have been your true friends at the feet of the nations enemies , to be still oppressed by their cruelty . Surely if these Lords and freeholders have their enclosures established to them in peace , is not that freedom enough ? Must they needs have the common land likewise ? As Ahab , that was restless till he had Naboth's vineyard , and so in the midst of their abundance , yet will eat the bread out of the poors' mouths . Oh , the land mourns in her children , under the hard hearted covetousness of these men . 

Fifthly , if you establish the old Norman laws , that Lords of manors shall still have the Commons and waste lands , than you are the maintainers of the old Norman murder and theft still ; for Lords of manors came to be tyrants over the poor enslaved English , by the murder and theft of William the conqu•rour , and downward to this day they have held title to their royalties therefrom , and from the will of the King ; for when he had conquered , he turned the English out , and gave their land to his Norman soldiers . 

Sixthly , if you establish the old Norman laws , and this especially ▪ that the Lords of manors shall still be Lords of the common land and the common persons be still enslaved to them , than you pull the guilt of King Charles his blood upon your own heads ; for than it will appear to the view of all men , that you cut off the King's head , that you Might establish yourselves in his chair of government , and that your aim was not to throw down tyranny , but the tyrant . But alas , the King's blood was not our burden , it was those oppressing Norman laws , whereby he enslaved us , that we groaded under . 

Let it not be said in the ears of posterity , that the gentry of England assembled in parliament , proved covenant-breakers , oaths , protestations , and promise brekkers to God , and the common persons , after their own turn was served ; and killed the King for his power and government , as a thief kills a true man for his money . I do not say you have done so , but for shame dally no longer , but cut off the bad laws , with the King's head , and let the poor oppressed go free , as well as the gentry and clergy , and you will find more peace . Let the common land be set free , break the Norman yoke of Lords of manors ; and pull not the cries and blood of the poor oppressed upon you 

Seventhly , know this , that if ever you , or any parliament of England , do England good , you must make all your laws in the light of equity and reason , respecting the freedom of all sorts of persons ; but if you respect some sort of persons , to wit , the gentry , and clergy , and give freedom to them ; for they , by virtue of your act of parliament , establishing the old Norman laws , do arrest and trouble me and others , for digging upon the Commons , whereas by virtue of the victory over the King , in regard i have to my estate given free quarter and taxes for England's liberty , as they have done , i have as much right to the common land as they ; therefore i say , if the gentry and clergy must have their Norman power established to them , and the common persons , that are more considerable for number and necessities , be left still under the yoke , you will be proved the foolish builders . 

Surely if you found out the court of wards to be a burden , and freed Lords of manors , and gentry from paying fines to the King ; and freed their children from the slavery of falling ward ; let the common persons be set free too from paying homage to Lords of manors ; and let all sorts have freedom by virtue of this conquest over the Norman successor• and seeing you took away the will of the King from enslaving Lords of manors , take away the will of Lords of manors from enslaving the common persons . 

Thus Sirs , we have made our appeal to you , as the only men that must and can give sentence of freedom in this controversy , and that you will not leave us in the cruel hands of Lords of manors , the successors of the Norman taskmasters ; for there are but three ways that Lords of Man••• can lay claim to the common land , and yet all three are too weak to build a just title upon : 

First , if they can prove , that the earth was made by almighty God peculiarly for them , and not for others equal with them , than we have trespassed in digging upon their rights ; but the earth was made as free for us as for them ; therefore they have trespassed against us their fellow-creatures , in troubling us by their tyrannical arrest , and hindering us from our righteous labour . 

Secondly , if they say , that others sold or gave them the title to the Commons , by way of inheritance ; they are to prove by what authority any other had from the pure law of our creation , to give away or sell the earth from the use of any of their fellow creatures , it being the common store-house of livelihood for all , without respect of persons . 

He that sells the earth , and he that buys , doth remove the landmark from the third person , because the land that is bought and sold , belongs to the third man , as well as to the other two that buys and sells ; and they two persons that buys and sells , and leaves the land that is bought for an inheritance to their children , excluding others , they murder the third man , because they steal away his livelihood from him ; for after a man hath bought the land , and paid money for it to another , he saith , this is my land , i have paid for it : but the third man comes in , and saith , the land is mine , equal with you by the law of creation ; and so he that is the buyer , he begins to draw his sword , and to fight ; and if he conquer , he rejoices , and says , the land is now mine indeed , i have bought , and i have conquered . But thou coverous person , so long as there is another man in the world besides thee , and him whom thou hast killed , the earth belongs to him as well as to thee ; and this is the case of the nations of the world , and thus propriety came in , and hath been left as an inheritance to children ; which is the burden the creation groans under . 

Here we see who are thieves and murderers ; even the buyers and sellers of land , with her fruits , these are they that take away another man's right from him ; and that overthrows righteous propriety , to uphold particular propriety , which covetousness the god of this world hath set up . 

But thirdly , if Lords of manors say , as it is truth , that they hold title to the Commons by custom , from the Kings will , as they do , this is as bad as the other ; for we know the King came in by conquest , and gave the land to these forefathers , to be taskmasters over the conquered English . but if you say , that these later Kings were chosen by the persons , it is possible it Might be so , but surely it was when his greatness overawed them , or else they would never have chosen him to enslave them , and to set taskmasters over them . 

But seeing the common persons have joined person and purse with you , to recover yourselves from under the tyranny of Kings , and have prevailed ; the common persons now have more truer title to the common lands , than the Lords of manors , for they held title by conquest and sword of the King ( We now the common persons have recovered the land again by conquest and sword in casting out the King ) so that the title of Lords of manors is broke . 

Therefore now the common persons have more true title to the common land , than Lords of manors have , in regard they have recovered themselves out of slavery by taxes , free quarter , and conquest , yet we shut them not out , but let them take part with us as fellow creatures , and we with them , and so honour our creator in the work of his own hands . 

Thus we have declared our cause without flattery to you ; if you leave us in the hands of oppression , and under the power of the old tyrannical laws , know this , that we suffer in pursuit of o•• national covenant , endeavouring a reformation in our place and calling , according to the word of God , and you shall be left without excuse . 

Set the land free from oppression , and righteousness will be the laws , government , and strength of that persons . 

These are some of the Norman laws which William the conqueror brought into England . 

First , he turned the English out of their lands , and placed his Norman soldiers therein , and made those that had the greatest portion , Lords , and Barons , and gave them a royalty to the Commons , to hold from his will , as a custom , whereby the common persons should not plant themselves anywhere in the land , upon any common-land , but some Lord of manor or other should know of it , and hinder them , as these three that have arrested us , viz. Wonman , Verny , and Winwood , Lord , knight , and esquire , the three estates of the Norman gentry , will not suffer us to dig quietly upon George's hill , but seek to drive us off , having no more claim thereunto but an ancient custom , which they hold from the King's will , where by they have , and still would tyrannize over the persons : and this is the rise and standing of Lords of manors . 

Secondly , another Norman law is this ▪ William the conqueror caused the laws to be written in the Norman and French tongue ; and then appointed his own Norman persons to expound and interpret those laws , and appointed the English persons to pay them 〈◊〉 fee for their pains , and from hence came in the trade of lawyers ; he commanded likewise that noman should plead his owncause , but those lawyers should do it for them . 

Thirdly , William the conqueror broke that good and quiet course of ending controversies in a neighbourhood , and commanded the persons to come up to Westminster stir to the four terms every year to have their causes tried . 

Fourthly , William the conquer or brought in the paying of tithes to the clergy , in thankfulness to the Pope , and clergies good services in preaching for him , and so to persuade the persons to embrace him . 

These are some of the Norman laws and burdens , which if removed , it would be much ease and quiet to this nation .
