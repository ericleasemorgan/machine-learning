The tyranny of tyrannies . 

These are to signify to all freeborn English men , that the new Turkish tyrants , Cromwell and Ireton , at a council of war , have already privately condemned to death Sir William Waller and Major general Browne , members of parliament , free men of England , men that have faithfully fought the battles of their country in order to their country's peace , not their own tyranny and dominion over the persons ; one of them a sheriff of the city of London , in whose blood they will write their own victory , and the city's slavery : neither of whom being under any jurisdiction of martial law . Whereby other men May well foresee , this shall be a leading precedent for many thousands more to follow . And this is done , they never having been heard , sent for , or any evidence produced against them . And it is resolved , their heads shall be cut off before Saturday next , to strike a terror into the whole kingdom , that no man May oppose their tyranny . Of which we thought good to give you notice , that all men May assist these condemned gentlemen with their prayers ; in whose veins the religion , laws and liberties of this kingdom lie bleeding , unless the whole kingdom as one man rise up against these bloody tyrants , and shake off their yoke before it be settled . Cromwell and Ireton have lately found out a new anabaptistical light or principle to act these tragedies upon the lives of innocent men : that though they have no proofs nor evidence , yet if they think in their consciences they are guilty , they May condemn them out of the testimony of their own private consciences .

Gen . 49. 5 , 6.  

Simeon and Levi are brethren , instruments of cruelty are in their habitations . Oh my soul , come not thou into their secret : unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united ; for in their anger they slew a man , & in their self-will they digged down a wall .
