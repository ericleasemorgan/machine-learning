¶ the intentions of the army of the kingdom of Scotland , declared to their brethren of England : by the commissioners of the late parliament , and by the general , noblemen , Barons , and others , officers of the army . 

The best endeavours , and greatest works wherein the hand and providence of God have been most evident and sensible , and the hearts and intentions of men called to be the instruments most pious and sincere , though they found approbation with the wiser sort , and such as are given to observation , yet they have ever been subject to be misconstrued by blind suspicion , to be reproved by cavilling censure , which maketh place for itself to enter where it findeth none , and to be condemned of the ignorant , and of such as are at ease , but most of all of the malicious , who can not be pleased even when God is best pleased , and when men seek to approve themselves to unsavoury ones conscience ; but in their hearts wish rather that the temple should not be built , religion never reform , and they themselves couch betwixt the two burdens , than that they should be in their worldly projects or possessions opposed or troubled . the deliverance of the persons of God of old from the Egyptian servitude ; the redemption of the kirk by the son of God , and the planting of Christian religion by his servants , and the vindication of religion from Romish superstition and tyranny , which are the greatest and most wonderful works of God , have been most bitterly calumniated , and spitefully spurned against by the wicked . 

The nature and quality of this great work , wherein the Lord hath honoured us to be agents , and the experience which we have found of continual opposition , since the beginning , May teach us , if we be not as the horse and muse which have no understanding , that we are to expect the gainsaying of sinners ; and that nothing can be hatched in hell by Satan , or prompted by his supposts on earth , which will not be produced to make us and the cause of God , which we maintain odious to all men , but most of all to our neighbours and dearest brethren . When we shall now enter into England , it will be laid to our charge , that we mind nothing but invasion , and that no less hath been intended by us from the beginning , then under the pretext of seeking our religion and liberties , to enrich ourselves with their possessions and goods : but our peaceable carriage many years past , before the time of those late troubles , our informations , declarations , and remonstrances published to the world , wherein we have cursed all national invasion , and our willingness when we were in arms , to lay them down upon the smallest assurances of enjoying our religion and liberties , will be conceived by the wise and well affected , to be more plain and sure evidences of our meaning , than all that malice can device , or calumny can express against us . 

Neither have any new emergents altered , but rather confirmed our former resolutions . for although both before and since the late pacification , we have been highly injuried by some Papists , and prelates , and their adherents there , who have been , and are still seeking no less than that we should no more be a kirk or a nation , and therefore themselves can not think , but we must account of them as God's enemies and ours ; yet above all the favours we have received from the good persons and body of the kingdom of England , one there is , which hath highly honoured them before the world , and endeared them unto us more than before , which shall never be forgotten by us , and we hope shall be thankfully remembered by our children , and children's children after us , to all generations ; that when upon misinformation , the council of England had concluded to use force against us , when the parliament of Ireland had offered their persons and estates for supply against us , when all plots and policies were set on work , and public declarations by authority were made , and the parliament called for this very end , when we had been traduced and proclaimed as traitors and rebels at every paroch kirk ▪ yet so wise , so grave , so just was that high court of parliament ( To their everlasting honour be it remembered ) that no threatenings , nor fears , nor promises , nor hopes , could move them to decern a war , or grant any subsidy for a war against us ; but rather by their speeches , complaints , and grievances parallel to ours , did justify the cause which we defend . 

This rich and recent favour doth so bind our hearts , that were our power never so great , we should judge ourselves the unworthiest of all men , and could look for no less than vengeance from the righteous God , if we should move hand or foot against that nation , so comfortably to us represented in that honourable meeting . In this our then full acknowledgement , we desire that the city of London May have their own large share , as they well deserve by the noble proofs they have given of their constant affection to religion , and the peace of both kingdoms , notwithstanding the continual assaults of the misleaders of King and court living amongst them , and always sounding the trumpet of sedition in their ears : and if this which doth so convince us , shall not be thought sufficient to satisfy all the good persons of England , we now before God and the world , make offer in general , and will make offer to so many of them as will require it in particular , of the strongest and most inviolable bond of our solemn oath and religious attestation of the great name of God , who is our fear & our dread , & from whom we hope for a blessing upon our expedition , that we intend no enmity or rapine , and shall take no man's goods , nor engage ourselves in blood by fighting , unless we be forced unto it , which we May look for from the Papists , prelates , and others of that faction ; but that any such thing shall come from godly men , or good patriots who love the truth of religion , or the King's honour , and their own liberty , both the rule of charity , which entertaineth no suspicion , where there is no evill-deserving , and the rule of wisdom , which teacheth , that both nations must now stand or fall together , do forbid us to apprehend . 

All the design of both kingdoms is , for the truth of religion , and for the just liberty of the subject ; and all the devices and doings of the enemy are for oppressing of both , that our religion May be turned into superstition and atheism , and our liberty into base servitude and bondage : to bring this to pass , they have certainly conceived , that the blocking up of this kingdom by sea and land , would prove a powerful and infallible mean : for either within a very short time shall we through want of trade , and spoiling of our goods , be brought to such extremity , poverty , and confusion , that we shall miserably desire the conditions which we now despise and decline , and be forced to embrace their will for a law , both in kirk and policy , which will be a precedent for the like misery in England , taught by our example to be more wise . Or upon the other part , we shall by this invasion be constrained furiously , and without order , to break into England , which we believe is their more earnest desire , because a more speedy execution of their design : for we doubt not but upon our coming , clamours will be raised , posts sent , and proclamations made through the kingdom , to slander our pious and just intentions , as if this had been our meaning from the beginning , to stir up all the English against us , that once being entered in blood , they May with their own swords , extirpate their own religion , lay a present foundation with their own hands for building of Rome , in the midst of them , and be made the authors both of their own and our slavery , to continue for ever . 

But in this admirable opportunity of vindication of true religion and just liberty , if divine providence be looked upon with a reverent by , and men fearing God , and loving the King's honour , and peace of both kingdoms , shall walk worthy of their profession , although the enemies have obtained so much of their desires , as by cords of their own twisting to draw us into England , yet May their main design be disappointed , the rope which they have made , brought upon their own necks , and their wisdom turned into foolishness , which we have reason to hope for from that supreme wisdom and power , which hath in all the proceedings of this work , turned their devices upon their own pates that plotted them . 

In our informations , remonstrances , and the true representation of our proceeding ; since the late pacification , we have so far expressed the wrongs which we have sustained , and the distresses which we suffer , as May make manifest our pressing necessity , to take some other course for our present relief , than such petitions , supplications , and commissions , as we have used before , with less success , then could have been expected of a kingdom from their own native King . Before we stirred so much as with a petition , we endured for many years , not only the perpetual opposition of the truth and power of religion by prelates and Papists , but also the violation of all our liberties , and almost the total subversion of our religion , which was our comfort in the sight of God , and the glory of this nation in the sight of other kirks , who by the testimony of their divines , made our reformation the measure of their wishes , and would have redeemed it with their greatest worldly losses . When gross popery was notoriously obtruded upon us in the books of canons and common prayer , without consent or knowledge of the church , and the plot of the prelates and Papists wholly discovered , how to settle it in both nations , we added to our former sufferings , no other arms but prayers and tears unto God : and petitions unto our King , which were utterly rejected ; the books and corruptions against which we petitioned , highly exalted , and by the insolent advice of those who govern now his counsels , and labour to establish their own evil acquired greatness , upon our oppression , and the ruins of our religion and liberties , we were forbidden to insist , under the pain of high treason . When we found ourselves thus opposed and born down , still insisting in our humble desires , we solemnly renewed our national oath and covenant , for preserving of our religion and liberties , and of his majesty's authority , knowing the violation of that oath , to be the guiltiness which had procured our woes , and that our repentance and turning to God , were the means by his blessing for good success . When contrary to our deserving and expectation , his majesty was moved by wicked counsel , to March toward us with an army , we were very soon pleased , and choosed rather to neglect such courses , as Might serve for our human safety , then to fall in seeming disobedience to our King , or to give the smallest distaste to our dear brethren in England : and therefore disbanded our forces , delivered all holds which were craved in testimony of our obedience : and so far complied with his majesty's pleasure , that notwithstanding the determination of our lawful former assembly called by his majesty , we were contented that a new free assembly and parliament should be appointed , where all things both concerning our religion and liberties , Might again be considered and established . When matters ecclesiastical were determined in the assembly , according to the constitutions of the kirk , in the presence , and with the consent of his majesty's commissioner , and the parliament was convened for perfecting the work , although we walked therein so warily , that no just provocation was given to his majesty , yet contrary to the laws and custom of this kingdom , the parliament so certainly promised , when his majesty was free of those bad counselors , was by their evil advyce prorogued ; which , to show our invincible obedience , we were content to suffer , and did sent up our commissioners to London , to render the reasons of our demands . When our commissioners and petitions of the parliament , called by his majesty , were so far rejected , that they were never seen nor heard , we send up our commissioners again with our propositions , which contained nothing but what was necessary for the good and peace of the kingdom , and was granted unto us before , under his majesty's hand , yet could they find no answer at all , which will be wondered at , and hardly believed by so many as are strangers at court , and know not that the Bishop of Canterbury , and the lieutenant of Ireland , with the assistance of the too too powerful faction of the Papists , labour to show their zeal for his majesty's greatness , by the oppressing the just liberties of the subjects , and the reform religion in all the three kingdoms . But in place of the gracious answer which we expected , our commissioners were restrained , and one of the noblemen imprisoned ; garrisons of strangers set over our heads , in an insolent and barbarous way , exercising their cruelty even against women and children ; our ships and goods taken and sunk , and the owners stripped naked , and more inhumanly used at the commandment of abused authority by the subjects of our own King , then by Turks and infidels . And great armies prepared against us , with a terrible commission to subdue and destroy ourselves , our religion , liberties , laws and all . 

In this extremity for us to send new commissioners or petitions , were against sense and experience ; those that govern the King's counsels being far from any inclination or intention to satisfy the just desires and grievances of the subjects , as they have made manifest by breaking up of the parliaments in both kingdoms . To sit still in senselessness and stupidity , waiting for our own destruction at the discretion of our merciless enemies ( Which were it not at this time joined with the cause of God , would move us the less ) is not only against religion , but nature ; teaching and commanding us to study our own preservation . To endure continual threatenings , and so great hostility and invasion from year to year , which is the professed policy of our enemies , is impossible ; and when we have examined our own strength , more than we are able to bear . We have therefore after much agitation and debating , with , and amongst ourselves , resolved to have our proceedings , which have been canvassed by so many , and brought to some point of determination in our own parliament , to be better known to the King's majesty , and the world , and especially to the kingdom of England , that against all false and artificial relations , they being nakedly seen to be what they are , we May obtain a better grounded and more durable peace , for enjoying of our religion and laws : and as we desire the unworthy authors of our troubles , who have come out from ourselves , to be tried at home , and justice to be done upon them , according to our own laws : so shall we press no further process against these pernicious counselors in England , the authors of all the miseries of both kingdoms , than what their own parliament shall decern to be their just deserving . 

When we look back upon this work of reformation from the beginning , and perceive the impressions of the providence of God in it , we are forced in the midst of all our difficulties and distresses , to bless God for his fatherly care and free love to this kirk and kingdom , and to take courage and spirit to proceed in patience & perseverance , whither he shall go before us , and lead us on . When the prelates were grown by their rents & lordly dignities , by their power over all sorts of his majesty's subjects , ministers , and others , by their places in parliament , council , college of justice , exchequer , and high commission , to an absolute dominion & greatness , and setting their one foot on the kirk , and the other on the state , were become intolerably insolent , even than did the work begin , and this was the Lord's opportunity . The beginnings were small , and promised no great thing , but have been so seconded and continually followed by divine providence , pressing us from step to step , that the necessity was invincible , and could not be resisted . It cannot be expressed what motions filled the hearts , what tears were poured forth from the eyes , and what cries came from the mouths of many thousands in this land at that time , from the sense of the love and power of God , raising them as from the dead , and giving them hopes after so great a deluge and vastation , to see a new world , wherein religion and righteousness should dwell ▪ when we were many times at a pause , and knew not well what to do , the fears , the furies , the peevishness , and the plots also of our dementat adversaries , opened the ways unto us , and taught us how to proceed ; and what they devised to ruin us , served most against themselves , and for raising and promooving the work . Although neither council , nor session , nor any other judicature , hath been all this time sitting , and there have been meetings of many thousands , at some times , yet have they been keeped without tumult or trouble , and without excess or riot , in better order , and greater quietness , then in the most peaceable times hath been found in this land . When we were content at the pacification , to lay down arms , & with great loss , to live at home in peace , our wicked enemies have been like the troubled sea when it cannot rest , whose waters cast up mire and dirt , and will have us to do that which it seemeth the Lord hath decreed against them . The purity of our intentions f•rre from base and earthly respects : the bent and inclination of our hearts in the midst of many dangers : the fitting of instruments , not only with a desire and disposition , but with spirit and ability to overcome opposition , and the constant peace of heart accompanying us in our ways , which beareth us out against all accusations and aspersions , are to us strong grounds of assurance , that God hath accepted our work , and will not leave us . We know that the Lord May use even wicked men in his servic• , and May fill their sails with a fair gale of abilities , and carry them on with a strong hand , which should make us to search our hearts the more narrowly : but as this ought not to discourage his own faithful servants , who out of love to his name , intend his honour , walk in his ways , find his peace ▪ comforting them , his providence directing them , and his presence blessing them in their affairs ; so it cannot be any just ground of quarrelling against the work of God . 

Yet all those our encouragements , which have upholden our hearts in the midst of many troubles , could not make our •ntry into England warrantable , if our peace , which we earnestly seek and follow after , could be found at home , or elsewhere . Where it is to be found , we must seek after it ; and no sooner shall we find it , but by laying down our arms , and by the evidences of our peaceable disposition , we shall make it manifest to the world , and especially to the kingdom of England , that we are seeking nothing else , and that our taking up of arms , was not for invasion , but for defence . No man needeth to plead by positive law for necessity : it is written in every man's heart by nature , and in all nations we find men have received it by practice ; that necessity is a sovereignty , a law above all laws , is subject to no law , and therefore is said to have no law : where necessity commandeth , the laws of nature and nations give their consent , and all positive laws are silent and give place . This law hath place sometimes to excuse , sometimes to extenuate , and sometimes to justify and warrant actions otherways questionable . And no greater necessity can be , than the preservation of religion which is the soul ; of the country which is the body ; of our lyves who are the members , and of the honour of the King who is the head : all those at this time are in a common hazard , and to preserve and secure all , we know no other way under the sun ( And if any man be so wise as to know it , we desire to hear it , and shall be ready to follow it ) but to take order with our common enemies , where they May be found , and to seek our assurance where it May be given . The question is not , whether we shall content ourselves with our own poverty , or enrich ourselves in England , that question is impious and absurd . Neither is the question whether we shall defend ourselves at home , or invade our neighbours and dearest brethren , this also were unchristian and unreasonable : but this is the question , whether it be wisdom and piety to keep ourselves within the borders till our throats be cut , and our religion , laws , and country be destroyed : or shall we bestir ourselves , and seek our safeguard , peace and liberty in England : whether we shall do or die ; whether we sha•l go and live , or abide and perish : or more largely to express all , whether we who are not a few private persons , but a whole kingdom , shall lie under the burden of so many accusations , as scarcely in the worst times have been intended against Christians , receive the service book , and the whole body of popery , embrace the prelates , and their abjured hierarchy , renounce our solemn oath and covenant , so many times sworn by us , lose all our labours and pains in this cause , and forget our former slavery and wont desires of redemption at the dearest rate , tickle the minds of our enemies with joy , and strengthen their hands with violence , and fill the hearts of our friends with sorrow , and their faces with shame , because of us , desert and dishonour the son of God , whose cause we have undertaken , whose banner we have displayed , and whose truth and power hath been this time past , more comfortable unto us , than all that the peace and prosperity of the world could have rendered , and draw upon ourselves all the judgements which God hath executed upon apostates since the beginning ; or shall we fold our hands , and wait for the perfect slavery or ourselves , and our posterity , in our souls , bodies , and estates , and ( Which is all one ) foolishly to stand to our defence , where we know it is impossible ; or shall we seek our relief in following the calling of God , ( For our necessity can be interpreted to be no less and entering by the door which his providence hath opened unto us , when all ways are stopped beside ? 

Our enemies at first did shroud themselves so far with the King's authority , that they behoved to stand and fall together , and that to censure them , was treason against the King . But we have shown , that the King's crown is not tied to a prelates mitre ; and that the one May be cast unto the ground , and the other have a greater lustre and glory then before . Now they take themselves to another starting hole , and would have men think , that to come in to England , and to pursue them , although legally , is to invade the kingdom where they live ; as if the cutting away of an excrescence , or the curing of an impostume , were the killing of the body . Let them secure themselves under the shelter of their own fantasies ; but we are not so undiscerning , as like mad men , to run furiously upon such as they first meet with , and come in their way . For although it cannot be denied , but the wrongs done unto us ; as the breaking of the late peace , crying us down as rebels and traitors , the taking of our ships and goods , the imprisoning of our commissioners , the acts of hostility done by the English in our castles : had they been done by the state or kingdom of England , they Might have been just causes of a national quarrelling : yet since the kingdom of England , convened in parliament , have refused to contribute any supply against us , have shown themselves to be pressed with grievances like unto ours , have earnestly pleaded for redress and remedy , and a declaration made , that his majesty our of parliament will redress them , which Might be a cure for the grievances of particular subjects , but national grievances require the hand of the parliament for their cure ▪ for preventing whereof , the parliament was broken up and dissolved . Neither do we quarrel with the kingdom for the injuries which we sustain ▪ nor can they quarrel with us , for taking order with that prevalent faction of Papists & prelates , the authors of so many woes to both nations , let all who love religion & their liberty join against the common enemies , and let them be accursed who shall not seek the preservation of their neighbour nation , both in religion and laws , as their own , as knowing that the ruin of one , will prove the ruin of both . 

And as we attest the god of heaven and earth , that those and no other are our intentions ; so upon the same greatest attestation do we declare , that for achieving those ends , we shall neither spare our pains , fortunes , nor lives , which we know cannot be more profitably & honourably spent : that we shall not take from our friends & brethren , from a thread even to a shoe latchet , but for our own monies , and the just payment , that we come amongst them as their friends and brethren , very sensible of their by-past sufferings & present dangers , both in religion and liberties , and most willing to do them all the good we can . Like as we certainly expect , that they from the like sense of our hard condition , and intolerable distresses , which hath forced us to come from our own country , will join and concur with us , in the most just and noble ways , for obtaining our just desires : and when our own monies and means are spent , we shall crave nothing but upon sufficient surety of repayment , how soon possibly it can be made , what is necessary for the entertainment of our army , which we are assured so many as love religion , and the peace of both kingdoms , will willingly offer , as that which they know we cannot want , and in their wise foresight will provide the way to furnish necessaries , and to receive the surety . This course being keeped by both sides , will neither harm our brethren , for they shall be satisfied to the least farthing ; nor ourselves , who look for a recompense from the rich providence of God , for whose sake we have hazarded the loss of all things . The escapes of some soldiers ( If any shall happen ) we trust shall not be imputed unto us , who shall labour by all means to prevent them more carefully , & to punish them more severely , then if done to ourselves , & in our own country . Our professed enemies the Papists & prelates , with their adherents , & the receipters of their goods & gear , we conceive will  be more provident , then to refuse us necessary sustentation , when they remember what counsel was given by them , for declaring all our possessions to be forfeited , & to be disposed of to them , as well deserving subjects . We shall demand nothing of the King's majesty , but the settling and securing of the true religion , and liberties of this kingdom , according to the constitutions and acts of the late assemblies , and parliament , and what a just Prince oweth by the laws of God and the country , to his grieved subjects , coming before him with their humble desires and supplications . Our abode in England shall  be for no longer time , then in their parliament our just grievances and complaints shall be heard and redressed , sufficient assurance given for the legal trial and punishment of the authors of our evils , and for enjoying of our religion and liberties in peace , against the invasion of their countrymen . Our returning thereafter shall be with expedition , in a peaceable and orderly way , far from all molestation ; and we trust the effect shall be against Papists the extirpation of popery , against prelates the reformation of the kirk , against atheists the flourishing of the gospel , and against traitors and firebrands , a perfect and durable union and love between the two kingdoms : which , he grant who knoweth our intentions and desires , and is able to bring them to pass . And if any more be required , God will reveal it , and go before both nations ; and if he go before us , who will not follow , or refuse to put their necks to the work of the Lord ?
