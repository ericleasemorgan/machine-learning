The Genius of True Enslish-men , 

Tacitus de vit . Jul. Agr. cap . 13.  

Britanni delectum ac Tributa & Injuncta Imperij Munera impigri obeunt , si Injuriae absint , has aegri tolerant ; Jam domiti ut pareant nondum ut Serviant . 

The Britain's are a sort of People that pay very freely all manner of Tributes and Taxes to the Empire Loyally Imposed , but cannot endure Injuries ; and had rather Perish than live as Slaves . 

The Freeborn English Generous and Wise , 
Hate Chains , but do not Government despise . 
Rights of the CROWN , Tributes and Taxes they , 
( When Lawfully demanded ) freely pay : 
Force they abhor , and Wrongs they scorn to bear , 
more guided by their Judgement than their Fear , 
Justice with them is never called Severe . 
Here Power by Tyranny was never got , 
Laws may ( perhaps ) Enslave , but FORCE cannot . 
Rash Counsels here have still the worst Effect , 
The furest way to Reign , is to Protect . 
King's are least safe in their Unbounded Will , 
Joined with the wretched Power of doing ill ; 
Forsaken most when they 're most Absolute , 
LAWS guard the MAN , and only bind the Brutus . 
To Force that Guard with the worst so to join , 
Can never be a Prudent KING'S Design , 
What KING would change to be a Caitiline ? 
Break his own Laws , shake an unquestioned Throne , 
Conspire with Vassals to Usurp his own . 
't is rather some base Fav'rites Vile Pretence , 
To Tyrannize at the wronged KING'S Expense . 
Let France grow Proud beneath the Tyrant's Lust , 
Whilst the Racked People crawl and lick the Dust . 
The Mighty Genius of this Isle disdains 
Ambition , Slavery , and Golden Chains : 
ENGLAND to Servile Yokes did never bow , 
What Conqueror's ne'er presumed who dare do now ? 
ROMAN nor NORMAN never could pretend 
To have Enslaved , but made this Isle their Friend .
