The declaration of the right honourable , Ralph Lord Hopton , lieutenant general of all his majesty's forces designed for the West of England . 

Gentlemen , 

When i consider ( But not without astonishment ) with what serpentine policy , simulated piety , sly delusions , grand impostorisms , and palpable jugglings the rebels have cloaked over their unparalleled treasons , casting before you the sweet delicious baits of reformation , liberty , freedom , &c. till they have smote a hook through your jaws , entangled you in their nets , and new-chained you to perpetual bondage , more than Kinging it over your lives , laws and estates , i cannot only grieve , but much pity the deplorable condition your two much credulity , and greedy listening after these State-syrens hath betrayed you unto . 

I hope ( After all this time ) when you are so feelingly sensible of the heavy pressures that lie upon you ; i need not seek to unblind you ; nor discover unto you by what nefarious , wicked , and desperate designs they have prosecuted the very quintiscense of all impiety , and skrewed themselves up to the height of all wickedness . 

As under a specious pretence of reforming ••ligion , they have quite abolished the same , killed , plundered and imprisoned , sequestered and outed the most zealous professors thereof ; and taken to themselves the maintenance belonging thereto , altogether disheartening not only the professors , but all true lovers , cherishers and maintainers thereof . 

When they covenanted and swore to maintain the King's majesty's person , they not only shot bullets of iron and lead in his face , but laid violent hands thereon , and barbarously and inhumanly murdered him , even before the gate of h•s own r•yall manor , contrary to Christian religion , the laws of God , nature , reason , or any former warrantable precedent whatsoeu•r . 

Neither did their malice anchor here , but they have above all thought of wickedness dissinherited his right heir ( Now our most gracious King Charles the second ) against their former oaths , keeping him from his birthright , and lawf•ll inheritance , and •ll that hopeful and kingly progi•y by these miscreants d•barred from possessing their hereditary revenues , and having ••olished kingly government have usurped all power to themselves , and shared their princely revenues amongst themselves and their confederates , exposed those royal branches to the mercy of strangers , which none but the veriest miscreants nature ever yet produced , but would have shamed to do . 

Neith•r hath their arrogance stopped here , but their blushless ambition hath elevated them to that pitch of pride , th•t they have set themselves down in his own princely throne , where they more than King it over their fellow subjects , tyrannising over them more than ever King of England did before or since the conquest ; and not only over pa•t , but over all his m•iesties' kingdoms . 

Y•t h•ve they persuaded the too credulous persons into an expectation of their maintaining the laws of the land and the liberty of the subject , whilst they perfidiously have deprived them of both , in murd•ring some , and plundering •therss , till at last they had involu•d all in more than Egyptian slavery to the arbitrary wills , and lawl•sse swords of a merciless gener•tion of atheists , sectaries , and desperate rebels ; that fear no god , nor acknowl•dge no King . 

What they have done under colour of maintaining the privilege of parliament , i know you cannot be •gnot•nt ; but must acknowl•dge , that they have apparently and vilely against all faith , covenants , oaths , attestations , made before G•d and his angels , violated the s•me , by murd•ring the King , den•ing the house of Lords to sit , •nd by p•uc•ing divers of their own members out of the house , and imprisoning them , •ill the remainder of their desp•r•te r•bellss in the remnant of their j•ncto had voted and unvoted the pleasures of the Grand•eses , or leading reb•llss of th•faction ; all these are so undeniable truths , that they are able to si••nce the most brazen-faced impostor of them all , even Cromwell hims••f . 

Under such like specious pretences , and flowe•s of pretend•d•d reformation have these pestiferous snakes ( Or rather s••ak• ) hide their poisonous stings , yet have so bewitchingly charmed the deluded persons ( By the name and power of parliament , though th•y retain nothing of the t•ue essence , but the mere app•llation thereof ) to become their slaves and v•ssallss : by which fallacious jugglings , prosecuted by Cromwell and such d•sperate rebels , have they reform three flourishing kingdoms into three languishing and distracted nations , and have raised a factious and brorken crew of mechanics , men of wicked lives , evil manners , and very desperate principles to bear sw•y over you , calling themselves a parliament , a counsel of state ; a high court of justice , &c. when ind•ed they appear at best but woolves in lions skins , an• those that have wad•d so far in rebellious courses , that they cannot return ; and therefore ( As the devil drives them ) must on , though to their own destruction . 

countrymen , i hope you retain still the hearts and courage of true-bred English , that had rather bow to the head , the worship the h••l , yield obedience to one King , than many tyrants . 

His most gracious majesty , out of a tender and fatherly affection to all his good persons and subjects of his kingdom of England , is not only willing , and ready to pardon , and grant an act of oblivion to all and every one ( Excepting such who shall be found guilty of that most horrible murder committed on the sacred person of his dear father ) that upon sight or knowledge of this my declaration , do immediately , at the appoach of his majesty's army into any of their counties , abandon those wicked parricides , and rise , and join with me , and those forces already raised , ( By commission from his majesty ) for this so necessary service ; 

His majesty promiseth , by the word of a King ( Which he hopeth all true subjects will believe ) that so soon as God shall enable him to recover his rights , that he will summon a parliament , by which he will ratify and confirm what ever hath been done formerly by his royal father , and free parliaments , or what ever else shall be judged necessary for the well-being of his persons , and establishing this kingdom on the true and lasting foundation of a long and happy peace ; assuring you , that nothing under heaven shall be more pleasing unto him than the prosperity of his subjects , in as full an assurance of the enjoyments of their laws , liberties , freedoms , and birthrights , as ever were granted by any of his predecessors to this day . 

Neither doth his majesty require or demand of any of his good subjects , but that they ( Abandoning rebels return to that dutiful obedience , for which they have warrant from God's holy word ; and assist him in their faithful service , not only to free themselves from the yoke of slavery , but assist him in bringing to justice those most horrid murderers of his royal father , to re-establish him in his just right of government , to vindicate the privilege of parliament , and so by God's blessing , bring peace and righteousness to kiss each other ; so that by it both Prince and persons May be made alike happy ; and this lately famous island wash off those deep died stains of blood in the fountains of affection to each other ; knowing that he that commanded us not to kill , commanded us to love one another , not to heap burdens , but to bear one another's burdens . 

Wherefore ( Dear countrymen ) if there yet remains any spark of loyalty , any sense of duty to God , obedience to your King , affection to your country , love to your friends , pity to your wives , children , or houses , or to your own souls , shake off this servile yoke of base tyranny ; and see what a happy exchange it will be , when in stead of the sword , oppression and violence of every rebel or rakeshame , you are governed by a hopeful , just , and prudent Prince . 

I have hitherto found both your love and valour firm to God , your King and country ; and am persuaded in so little time i cannot loose the principal , because i have not desired the interest ; but since time hath ripened his majesty's occasions to maturity , i am persuaded you will deny neither , but undauntedly draw your swords with me to revenge the horrible and execrable murder of your King , redeem your nation from infamy , and yourselves from slavery , restore your King , and make yourselves famous to all posterity . 

Therefore ( countrymen ) i desire you , not only as Christians , but fellow-soldiers , subjects , brethren and friends ( At the approach of the army committed to my charge , and designed for the West of England ) to join yourselves with us , in his majesty's service , which is so necessary , and full of all conscience , duty , honour , and all other just interests . 

And for myself , or the army under my conduct , i do promise by the word of a soldier , that to the utmost of my power , i will use all fair means possible for reducement of these Western counties to his majesty's obedience , without any spoil , forage , fyring of houses , plunder or the like , or uncivil or unchristian dealing with any ; and when engaged , not to shed more blood than what i shall be necessitated to do for preservation of myself , and those committed to my charge . 

Therefore let none who shall engage with me , fear or apprehend any dangers that May ensue so much as abhor the present evils under which you groan ; no parallel being found either in sacred writ , or modern history , of any persons besides yourselves , so free as you under a late gracious King , and so soon enslaved , vassallaged , and brought to so vile and unjust servitude and oppressions , laid on you by the worst of men . 

Therefore ( Gentlemen ) for the better encouragement of all you that shall any ways suffer , or be damnified in aiding o• assisting us in the o•pposition , suppressing , or subduing of these execrable rebels ; i do by his majesty's special command declare . 

That so soon as God shall restore his majesty to his rights , all such losses , or sufferings ( Of any that shall be aiding or assisting unto us in his majesty's service shall be taken into special consideration , and repaired out of the estates of those in actual rebellion against his majesty ; and their so acceptable service be rewarded , according as they shall be found to deserve ; and likewise have safe protection for themselves and families , and safe conduct for any their shipping from any sea-port-town that shall be brought to yield obedience to his majesty , to what coast they shall desire . 

And in this my so just , reasonable and pious request , and dutiful undertakings for his sacred majesty , and the good of my country in general ; i hope not only to be backed with the blessing of God , but the aid and assistance of all honest men ; which is the desire of 

Your affectionate friend , and servant . Hopton . 

Finis .
