The epistle to the reader . 

My dear hearts all and everyone of you , whether high or low , rich or poor , bond or free : i am a creature and one of your fellow-creatures , forced to send unto you a small mite , which i have had through the speakings of my infinite father in me , which speakings in me have been so burning hot and so powerful , that i have not been able to resist as for to keep them in secret , they being things which in this treatise i treat of , i have seen them as being taken in a trance and lying for dead about 22 hours : for the most part of them which in this following discourse , i had made out to me being in that condition , and assoon as i had seen and heard of them and they were over , so that i had no other at that time , i was forced to write them , it being the good pleasure of my father for to make choice of me so poor and and unable a despised instrument , for to reveal and make known such things as shall surely come to pass , as concerning the levelling of that which men for the present call their own , and so hoard up riches and treasures here on earth for to make themselves great and to be applauded of men , forgetting the exhortation of Jesus Christ , who bid them lay up treasures in heaven and not here on earth : for the laying up treasures here on earth Christ said the rust would take it : which the apostle James says plainly to such men that have hoarded up gold and silver , even the very rust of it will rise up in judgement against them : look to yourselves , here is the last vial to be poured forth , made mention of for to give you warning of yourselves , for behold the day of the Lord is at hand , he is coming to take vengeance on all his enemies , and for to confound you all that have abundance of treasures here on earth , and have laid up none in heaven , nay it seems to be an unpossible thing for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven ; for saith Jesus Christ , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of an needle , then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven : oh you rich men , what say you to these words ? do you think to go to heaven , when the rust of your silver will rise up in judgement against you ? you had more need throw away your riches here , and give them to the poor ; that the crying of the poor might no longer come into my ear , saith the Lord , for their sakes do i come to take vengeance on such hypocrites as you are , because you have forms of godliness , but deny the power thereof , you would fain appear to be holy , but yet you would be loathe to part from that which is the greatest enemy of you , as the apostle says , men coveting after riches have erred from the faith , and so have pierced themselves through many sorrows : but that this May no longer trouble you and keep you from coming to me , i will show myself for the poors' sake , when you through the hardness of your hearts have rather seen them starve for want of food then give them a piece of bread , yea though they cry for the Lord sake give me a piece of bread : when as all things are the Lords , and the Lord comes ; he comes , what to do ? he comes to bring down the pride and haughty looks of men ; what pride and haughty looks ? even such pride and haughty looks that scorn their fellow-creatures , even that must be brought down , even all their glory , and honour too , even that glory wherein you have gloried , and boasted yourselves : as because of your riches you have thought yourselves better than others ; and must have your fellow-creatures in bondage to you , and they must serve you , as to work for you , and moyl and toil for you , standing cap in hand to you , and must not displease you , no by no means ; but alas , what are you now i come , saith the Lord ? for i tell you that the Lord of host comes with fire and sword for to bring down your pride , and your glory and honour , and all these things that you have lifted up yourselves with , & have thought yourselves better than the rest , i say he comes to plague you , torment you , and so to make you weary of your idols which you have made to yourselves , for i must tell thee , and it will prove very true , that the mighty God of Jacob is at hand , and will come of a sudden when thou art not a ware of , even that mighty leveller , for to level and lay mountains and hills low , even you that are richer and greater than your fellow creatures , even as low as my May be , and so will make all equal with the plains ; for it is but just for him to do so , seeing thou fat swine of the earth , whatsoever thou hast is not thine own , but it is all the Lords ; and though it hath been his pleasure for to bestow riches on thee , and so have let you usurp authority over them , yet now the Lords is at hand , that he will call you . to an account , and finding you to be unjust stewards , he will put you out of your stewardship , and then you must no longer usurp , but shall be glad to be fellows with them whom now ye despise & hate , and cannot abide to let them be in your sight ; though this May seem strange to you and you will not believe it , yet it is the Lord's pleasure that i should send it forth to the public view , there being some that will consider these things before hand , & so be made for to go before in this manner , as to Count nothing their own , and this they do with joy ; when you that are obstinate , & will not believe the strange work which the Lord did speak by his prophets along time before this , & that new thing shall be done which persons shall little think of , as i will do a new work , which the prophet's point at , even that the Lord should make you throw away that which you do so much hug and look after , even the gold and silver which you make idols of : but whether you will or no , remember that it is the Lord's pleasure to send you this , as a thing to scourge you , yea a very strange thing it is like it May appear to you , but read on & fear not , but that the Lord of host who caused me to write this , will in his own time ( When he sees you to be in security and peace , crying peace to yourselves ) break in like a mighty man , and confound you of a sudden ; for it is his pleasure to deal harshly with you , and make you weary of yourselves , that so he May bring you through the fire to himself ; and make you to glory in himself , & not in any thing else beside himself , for many reasons why the Lord should do this May be shown . 

First , that the persons May understand the Lord of host is no respecter of persons , as to give liberty to some more then to others , in respect of those things that be necessary to the body , which was all made for the use of man , and that man should have the benefit of them all , which man hath a long time been deprived of the use of these outward things , as riches which other do enjoy ; and therefore seeing it was the pleasure of the father at the first , for to give to the creature man , an equal privilege to all a like , and not made man to be Lord over some part of the creation , and the other part of the creation be in subjection to some other man , no , but made man Lord over all , and that all were made for the use of man ; it is therefore no reason that man should be kept in bondage , as now they are , but that the just Lord who is in the midst of us , May show his power for to restore his creature man from the bondage they are now in , and so make man know that he was made a Lord over all other creatures , and so now shall once again by my power saith the Lord be brought for to enjoy the whole work of my hands , and so shall freely enjoy the whole creation without let or hindrance , in this day wherein i will make them free from the power of man , and so will bring man to be fellows one with the other , and not Lords over one another ; as they have been and are now . 

Secondly , it is time for the Lord to appear in this way for to soften the hearts of men , who are so cruel grown one to the other , as if they were not all of one mould or mettle , what is the reason men are so hardened one against another , but by reason of private interests which some have , and having more of their own as they call , it than others , their hearts are puffed up with pride , and so no longer will they be fellows , but Masters and Lords over the rest , and so engross more and more into their hands , by craftiness , until such time they get their desires , and when they have got their desires in some respect , they cannot rest satisfied , but will still proceed on in cruelty , and in making the rest of their fellow creatures their slaves , which is abomination to the Lord that they should do so , that they should enjoy the works of the Lord in full , and have their fill , and will not give to their fellow creatures any bread , yea though they beg for the Lord's sake for a piece of bread , yet they are so cruel as they will not bestow any thing upon them , but many poor creatures dyes for want of bread , thus cruelly they deal with their fellow creatures ; which the Lord of host will not suffer long to be , for they have hardened their hearts , and have made them as hard as a stone , but the Lord will soften your hearts , and make you know that you have dealt cruelly with your fellow-creatures and have reigned over them , but you shall now no longer reign in pomp , but you shall be brought to see by the power of the Lord of host , if you consider these scriptures which are at the beginning of several visions , you shall see and know that you are as far off from fulfilling the scriptures by your cruelty , and that you May see you break them daily for exercising so much cruelty as you do , which on the contrary if you did fulfil them , you would freely give to them that have need of them . 

And reader , i do hereby mind you of the other part , which i have not writ as my judgement , but by the speaking of my father to me , as concerning the Jews , even those that were Jews by nature , and are now dispersed abroad among the gentiles , how that it is the good pleasure of my father , who is infinite in himself , for to bring home his own persons into his own light , and so to make them see that Jesus whom their fathers crucified , was the King of the Jews , notwithstanding they could not at that time believe it , yet now through his almighty power which he will manifest by his strong and powerful hand , make them know that they have crucified their King , for which cause they have been dispersed abroad in the nations ; but now the father of love who is infinite of himself , will in love bring home those , even the Jews , and make them his spouse and choice jewels , together with the gentiles whom he will bring out of their country both out of mystical and literal Babylon , into their own country , even into the land of Canaan , a land of rest ; whom the father hath appointed to be in Judea , even to make the material city which the Jews formerly did inhabit , the praise of the whole earth , and the persons that shall be gathered thither , to be his choice Jews , and his wife ; which spouse and wife shall consist of all his chosen ones , whom he will bring up into his glory , both Jews and gentiles ; and how it will be his pleasure for to make others be quiet , and lie in peace , and will not let them come to disturb them , but will confound and plague them terribly , with such a blow that shall make them amazed , so that they shall not know what to do , but shall be glad , yea they shall think themselves happy if they can be at quiet and lie down in rest ; for the power of the mighty God of Jacob , even the infinite Jehovah shall be seen to be amongst them , so ( That they even the Jews ) shall not need to be afraid of any , but they shall lie down in peace and take their rest , and none shall make them afraid ; this will be the state and condition of Zion , that shall be gathered together to the city Jerusalem ; glory and light shall shine upon them , when darkness shall cover the earth . 

Courteous reader , let not the strangeness of these things make thee hard to believe , that such things as are here mentioned shall come to pass , by the rudeness of these lines having no eloquent terms to set them forth , and by reason of the weakness or contemptibleness of the writer of this piece , which must prove a torment and a fire to burn and torment the gods of the earth , and every thing that hath been idolised of or by men , they having set their fancies more upon outward objects then upon the all of all things . 

But rather let these times move thee to pity , and softness and tenderness of heart , with a yearning bowels of pity and compassion to thy poor fellow-creatures , who are destitute of the outward creatures , and perhaps have not bread to eat , or any drink to drink , or clothes to cover their nakedness , i say , be moved to all thy fellow-creatures with such pity and compassion , as to relieve their wants , and if thou hearest any cry in the streets for the Lord's sake give me a piece of bread , give him , and turn not thyself away and say thou hast nothing if thou hast , lest the Lord turns away himself from you , and you cry , and he will not hear ; as thou didst hear the poor cry and would not ; for know that pure religion is to visit the widow and the fatherless , that if you will indeed appear to be truly religious and not hypocrites , be kind hearted & give up to the relief of those that want . 

Moreover reader , i cannot choose but mind thee of a word or two , and that is this , you May read that Paul was Counted mad , but he said whither he was mad , or whither he were besides himself , it was for their sakes , and so say i , whether i am mad or besides myself , it is for your sakes : as it is the good pleasure of my father for to make me so , that i May give you warning of what he will do , or God in me speaks to you , for to make you cast away your idols and seem to the eye to be less practitioners of religion , that so you May be more fulfillers of your duties , and less hearers than now you are , that so you May be more perfect in doing ; and however you think of me , let not the notion of madness possess your spirits , as for you to think that i am mad , but rather think it is the pleasure of the father to turn the world upside-down , and so to make use of me as he did of his son Jesus Christ : and as his son Jesus did do things contrary to the custom of the world in those days , and all the powers of the world was not able for to keep him from doing his own work , even so i say , the infinite God having chosen me for to declare these things to you , i do not question but he will by his infinite power carry this his own work on , & none shall be able to hinder him from doing his pleasure . 

And however you do think of me , as to judge me by your pharisaical holiness , and are ready to cry out , i have a devil : yet it is no other with me than it was with Jesus Christ : whom the wise Pharises , or those that did seem to be most religious for those forms and customs as were then in use according to the law of Moses , which they were loathe to be beat off : even i say those did cry out against Jesus that he had a devil , and was the chief of the devils , and that he were a blasphemer ; notwithstanding he were the only son , sent of the father for to abolish and so put to an end those ways of worships that were then extant ; but they being possessed with a fancy of their own , that God would not forsake that which he had given to his servant Moses , & so to them for to continue for ever , and so would not believe that the Christ were the Messiah , because he came to alter and change the state and condition of their ways and forms as they walked by , notwithstanding it was the pleasure of the infinite God to forsake those forms although he had given them for to continue for ever , which ever came out so soon as the time was at an end , for to appear in that way , and then to leave that , and so to take to him another : and in forsaking of these forms which he had given them , his son whom he had sent , or his messengers met with many enemies , crying out against him and his apostles or disciple ; and among these his enemies were the learned Pharises and priests ; and they did stir up the persons for to forsake Christ and not to cleave to him , for he hath a devil , he speaks blasphemy , and will you believe what he says ? and so they cried out against Paul , how he turned the world upside-down , and away with him ( Said the learned Pharisee ) he is not fitting to live : and if my father's only choice son met with such hard servants for to deal with him so cruelly , and to tell him he had a devil , it is no wonder in this age of ours why i should ( Or any of the messengers of the Lord of host that are sent by him ) meet with any other but the same , as to be looked upon as one that turnth the world upside down , & so not sitting to live , by declaring new things ; as if the mighty God of Jacob had bound himself to be in one form , and to tarry there for ever , and so it is no more to me why you should call me a blasphemer , and you even you , oh destroying priests , that run before you be sent , and so in your pulpits vent your malice as to cry against me , and so to bid persons beware of me , seeing the priests in old time , & the outside hipocritical Pharisee in thosedays did do it to Jesus ; and i say it is no moere to me to be called so by a proud hipocritical dissembling outside people , that would fain appear to be godyl & so for such to say i am a blasphemer , & have a devil ; and thus some doth come as they did to Christ , some out of malice , and some out of ignorance , being loathe to be deprived of these forms and customs of ways and rules to walk by , for matter of worship , religion being then grown to be more used for custom sake , then for anything else , as it is now aday ; whereby it is high time for the Lord of host to appear , and so to take away your life , as your forms and ways of worships now ; and so for not making a right use of them , to deprive you of them , that you May no longer dissemble with your maker which will be but just with God for to do so : for notwithstanding all your forms and ways of worships which you have and walk by , ye are a most eruel and malicious persons , full of all manner of hypocrisy , and dissembling with God and with men ; but now your hearts shall be made manifest , and ye shall now appear in your own colours , and so shall be made manifest to all what you are ; for the day of the Lord of host is now at hand , to gather his out of mystical and literal Babylon , even to gather Zion together and so to gather the wheat from the chaff , and though you do , not believe any thing what i say , as being a persons bound up in your own ways , and so loathe to be deprived of that food , ready to reason with the mighty creator why he will reveal or make out himself to one more than to another , & will you say , surely methinks i hear you say so , that if God will make out himself by visions & revelations , surely he will do it as well to me as another , and because he doth it not to me , i do not believe he will do it to another , and thus Oye proud and stout hearted persons , that think all are deluded who have visions because you yourselves have none , and thus you bind and limit the holy one of Israel for to do nothing but what he will first make you acquainted with , and so make out to you , or else you will not believe ; and not only remain in unbelief , but you cry out against them , they are deluded , and are possessed with a devil , and so will rail and speak evil against them , and thus you show your malicious spirits , which rather declares yourself to be possessed with an evil spirit , or else to walk after the flesh and not after the spirit , for they that are led by the spirit of God , walk in peace , love , meekness , quietness , soberness tenderness , and full of compassion and pity , and these desire not to be rash and full of malice , speaking of evil , railing , cursing , judging , and condemning those that are not of the same mind with them , backbiters , adulterers , idolaters , covetous persons , thinking themselves better than others , and these and such as these walk after the flesh , and are the dogs and sorcerers that shall be left without the city , and shall not enter into the gates of the new Jerusalem ; for the spirit of God is a spirit of light and love , whereas the spirit of the devil is a spirit of cruelty , and murdering of their fellow creatures and is in darkness : and the reason why i write my name to be Jacob Israel , is because my name was changed from goerge in in a vision , to Jacob Israel Foster : and so i subscribe

The pouring forth of the seventh and last vial . 

I saw in a vision a man giving away his money to another , and also giving away food to feed him , and cloth to clothe him . And i heard a voice say , this man lends unto the Lord , and that man that feeds the hungry and clothes the naked , lends unto the Lord . 

For he that giveth to the poor dareth to the Lord , saith Solomon . oh you rich men that have abundance of gold and silver , and corn of all sorts : that hoard it up apace , and are loathe to feed the hungry and cloth the naked , do you think you do your duty , no saith the Lord of host , you do not do your duty , neither do you show yourselves ever a whit kind to me , for if you did , you would not be so eager as to lay up abundance and see your fellow creatures starve for hunger . Therefore remember that he that giveth to the poor , sendeth to the Lord , but you have not given to the poor ( For by the poor i mean those that are in want ) but ye have rather oppressed the poor , and have caused them to cry , and their cries are come into mine cares , for i the Lord of host to take vengeance on you for your cruelty against me ; for asmuch as you have not done it to one of these little ones , you have not done it to me , which if you had done it , as to clothe the naked and feed the hungry ; and freely disperse to them that are in want , in so doing you had done it to me , and had given me that back which i had given to you : and then you had done your duty in so doing : but because you have hardened your hearts and have heard the crying of the poor , and have not regarded them , but have thought yourselves too good for them , and have not laid it to heart that they are the works of my hand , and are made of the same mettle and of the same blood as you are , but have thought yourselves too good for them , because of the riches which i have lent you ; and have made your riches and your strength your god , and not me ( Saith the Lord , ) therefore i will now come and will not tarry , but will come quickly , and will take vengeance on you , and will judge you to be destroyed in my wrath , and confounded and stand amazed at my sore displeasure ; for i now do awake as a giant , and as a man of war to make you howl and weep , and to make you see that the rust of your gold and silver shall now rise up in judgement against you , and shall be a witness to torment you ; because you have not remembered me , as to feed the hungry , and clothe the naked : for i will now reason with you ( Saith the Lord ) is that which you have your own , or are they mine ? surely you will say they are mine ; for i the all of all things have made them all , yea all the beasts of the field are mine , and therefore you need not be so extraodinarily covetous as to keep these creatures which i lend you for your own private use : for if they had been your own and you could have made them , than you Might have had some colour , and have said shall i make them rich by my labour ? but know this ( Oh man ) that it is i , and i alone that am the life of all creatures , yea even thy life , and without me you are unable to do any thing , and it hath been my pleasure to bestow riches on you for this end and purpose , that thou Mightest give them freely to those that are in want , and not to make them your idols as you have done . But because you have done so , as to make your riches your idols and your gods , and have not considered that pure religion ( Even that religion that is pleasing to me ) is to visit the widow and the fatherless ; that is , to give and disperse that riches which you can spare to the relief of those that have need of them ; and than you had done well ; for in so doing you would have kept saint James from crying against you , but because you have not done it , therefore James bids you howl and weep for your gold and silver even the rust of it , even the rust or cankered stuff that you have laid up for your sons and daughter's portions for to make them rich , while in so doing you have kept back mine , which i sent you for to give to the poor ; therefore howl and weep , for i come , i come . 

A vision wherein i saw men feeding their enemies , and clothing of them , and so did show abundance of love to their fellow creatures ; and i heard a voice say that these men do hold forth my image , and do show themselves to be my sons and daughters in so doing , but they do nothing but what i have commanded them to do ( Saith the Lord of host ) but i will reward them for so doing , for i will keep them in my love and favour , when i will plague and torment the other that have not done so . 

If thy enemy hunger , feed him ; if he be naked , clothe him ; for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head : hear oh all flesh , for i have a controversy with you , and will now plead with you , especially you that have abundance of riches : have you fed the hungry ? hast thou fed them that thou accounts thine enemies ? If thou hast , thou in so doing hath done well ; but what meaneth the crying of the poor so much ; bread , bread , for the Lord sake ? surely this argues that you have not done as you should have done , but have left that undone which you should have done ; thou hast not fed thine enemy , neither hast thou clothed the naked , which thou shouldst have done : thy own conscience accusing thee shall now torment thee ; because thou liest under the breach of that scripture , where it is said feed thine enemy if he be hungry , and give him drink , if he be thirsty : oh you rich men , should you feed and clothe your enemies , as this scripture says you must do so ; how can you think that you are the servants of the most high ? whereas instead of feeding your enemies , you destroy them ; for this is quite contrary as black is to white , surely it is a sin , i know your conscience tells you it is a sin , because you do not fulfil the scripture . If this be a sin , how far greater sin is it when you take from them that that should preserve them from want , or take away their lives ? for you see it is your duty to preserve life , and not to take away life ; it is your duty to feed them , and not to kill them , saith i the Lord of host ; who will plague and torment you for not doing your duty , as to give that which you have of mine , ( That overplus which lies by and doth no good ) unto the poor , therefore howl and weep , and cry aloud , for the day of the Lord is at hand that burneth as an even , and the wicked shall be but as ashes under the soals of my saints feet : you live like dives in a most voluptuous manner , wearing of the best , and eating of the best , and drinking of the best ; and as he did not remember poor Lazarus , so you do not think having your fills of the poor , yea though they cry in your ear , yet you will not give them relief , but will rather see them starve for want of food : how do you provoke me to anger saith i the Lord of host ? do you think that i regard you , and you only because of riches ? no i would have you think that i regard the poor as well as you , even so much that i must now come down and destroy you , and give you your portion with dives , even to throw you into my wrath and there to torment you , and so to take away your riches and give them to my saints , even to these poor and hungry souls that are now in great want and misery : howl , howl and weep , for i come , even i that will plead for these poor creatures that you tread under foot , and Count them as nothing ; i come and will redeem them from you , and from your powers , and will make you know that i have regard to them , and that they are in my sight as precious as you ; and that i will be such a terror to them that have abundance of riches , that i will make you weep to think you must part from them , and to think that every one shall have part in your riches ; you shall be so tormented that you shall have but little rest ; for i will make you throw away your idols of gold and silver , and to hide yourselves for fear of me , for i am risen to destroy you and bring you to nothing , even i the Lord of host , will consume you in my jealousy . 

I saw in a vision that one rich man had fulfilled all the commands of God but one , and that one was , he was for to sell that which he had , and was to give it to the poor : but he ( Like the rich man in the scripture ) rather than he would do so , he would keep his riches , notwithstanding he was commanded to sell and distribute to the poor , and so lie under the breach of God's command ; for the which i saw this man tormented and at length was glad to give up to the poor ; and say , take eat , and fill yourselves , for it is not now mine but yours . 

Here you May see the power of the infinite Jehovah , and how strict he is to them that fulfil not all his commands . As if he should say , notwithstanding your going to church , and observing Sunday , and making a profession of me : and therefore you think that you shall escape my sore displeasure , in that you have done such and such things : but stay , know this afore you have rest , that one of my commands is , that you should sell your riches and give to the poor ; for saith Christ go sell all that thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : as if he should say if you do it not , it will be unpossible for you to get treasure in heaven , but methinks , i hear all and every one almost say , this is a hard saying , must we sell houses and lands , and give them away ? what a condition should we bring ourselves into if we should do so ? What art thou as can say , shall we give away our houses and lands ? do you know what you say , are they yours or mine ? saith i the Lord of host , they be mine , and all are mine , even whatsoever thou hast is mine ; though i have lent them to you it is not that you should only enjoy them , but that you should freely give up to relieve those that are in want , and so fulfil my commandment , sell that thou hast and give to the poor , or else i will torment you as i have done this man in the vision , and will make you be glad to give up and to say , take eat and drink , and fill yourselves , for it is not mine but yours ; and will make you know that i will do a strange work now here on the earth , for i will make you to see and know , that i have given unto the creature man , a privilege for to enjoy the whole creation and so to free them from bondage and slavery which for the present they lie under , and if you will not freely give up before i come in power , i will make you do it against your will , when i come in power , for behold i come , and will not tarry , in the mean while do not you deceive yourselves , and think yourselves too good for to give to the poor , for i come and will make you howl , howl ye rich men for the rust of your silver and gold will now rise up in judgement against you , for i come to destroy all things besides myself , and will suddenly take from man his gods , and pictures of gold and silver , and will make them for fear of me give them away ; for i come to take vengeance on those that have afflicted the poor : howl ye therefore that have afflicted the poor , and give up with speed before i take you and throw you into my wrath , and into my sore displeasure ; remember ye rich men that hear the cries of the poor , and come away , make your hands free to give ; remember that these are the last days , and that you must now use the world , as if you used it not : do you use the world as if you used it not think you ? that hoard up bags of gold and silver , and lay up quarters of grain , when many poor souls are ready to starve for want of them , but is it not to use the world as if you used it not , for to have no more than the present necessity calls for , and so to take no thought for the morrow : therefore up give freely , disperse abroad , and let not the cries of the poor any longer be in mine ears ; but now follow the apostles direction , use the world as if you used it not ; for the fashion of this world goeth : what is the fashion of this world but to strive who shall be greatest and richest , who shall have the most power , and who shall be most applauded , and so have most praise of men : 't is very true that this fashion hath been a long time , but this old fashion must go out , and theremust be a new fashion : which fashion will be instead of striving after riches , giving away of riches to them that have need of them , and so to make themselves equal with the rest , and not to Lord it over their fellow-creatures , but willingly do them all the good they can : for whether they be tongues they shall cease , or prophecies , they shall fail ; but charity shall abide for ever ; here the most excellent or the most transcendent things which have been or are for the present , though little thought of , must go : and whatsoever hath been , must now fly away ; for nothing must abide or continue but charity : the striving after riches must cease , and then there will not be so much oppression as is now , the striving after honour shall cease , and then there will be no killing of men for money , striving after self must cease , and then there will be no envy or malice , as to fight one with the other ; striving after learning must cease , for tongues shall in this manner as it is now gotten by human industry , though it May please God to endue his saints and chosen vessels with tongues at his first appearing or making out himself to them , as he did at the first appearing in flesh make out himself to his apostles ; but charity shall never cease : for indeed when all the other forementioned shall perish and come to nothing , then shall this be fulfilled , and not till then ; for so soon as all things that are now at the present passes away , and all things become new ; then will charity take place and so will abide for ever . 

i saw in a vision one give away all that he had and would not have any thing as his own , and i heard a voice say , that this man was come up to be his son , and was a true convert , and one that is come up in that dispensation , wherein i will in time bring all , saith the Lord of host . 

Lord , lo we have left all and followed thee ; we have left all , houses , and lands , and silver , and gold , and whatsoever was near or dear unto us we have for thy sake sold , and left all : this was the saying of the apostle who was a true convert , but you that are rich think it your honour for to keep your riches , and so to take delight in getting riches : but you see that the apostle left all , and so must you if you will have that love of God and favour that the apostle had , i come saith i the Lord of host , and will bring down all your pleasant things , and will bring down all your glory honour and strength , and will lay them down in the dust , i will terrify you , and plague you , and will make you know that i the Lord of host am a consuming fire , and so will make you freely give up that which you call yours , to your fellow creatures , for i have made all nations of one blood , and so will now at my bright appearing make all persons equal and alike for matter of riches , and so will take away the stumbling-block of private interests , and so will make the oppressors and the opression for to cease , and will make you know that i the Lord of host will do a new work on the earth , that is you shall now know that i will have all men ( After this little while ) be in no want , and so to this effect you that intend to be kept in my love and favour , be not so stouthearted as to keep back , but freely bestow on them that have need of the outward creatures , and i will come in power , making the rich men howl and weep , and throw abroad , and give away their idols of gold and silver , and be glad to creep into the holes and clefts of the rock for to hide themselves for fear of me , saith i the Lord of host . 

I saw in a vision a tree , and the boughs spread themselves abroad and was very great , but at length i saw one come with a sword and lopped off the boughs , and then cut off the tree in the middle , and at length digged up the roots of the tree , and so the tree fell away and was no more to be seen . 

And i said , Lord , what meaneth this tree ? and my excellent majesty the King of eternal glory , even that alpha and Omega , who is the life and fullness of all , by whom all lives , and moves , and have their being , said on this manner as followeth ; by the tree is meant all powers ( Great or small ) whether they be Popes , or Emperors , or Kings , Princes , Dukes , or parliaments ; he whom you saw hew off the boughs , first represents i the Lord of host , who will now cut off those superfluous branches , as those that have made themselves rich by earthly powers , and not only them , but i will cut the tree in the middle , even the very heart of all powers in sunder , and so will proceed on for to cut down the very root and foundation of all earthly powers , as is shown by the digging up the root of the tree aforesaid : thus as the tree was digged up by the roots , even so as this tree represents all powers , so will i root up all powers , even i the Lord of host , the root and foundation of all powers for the present are set up by the power and strength of men in all nations . It being the good pleasure of i the Lord of host that it should be so : and so by the strength and might of men the mankind that are made all of one mould and clay destroy one another , which arises from a fleshly domineering and Esau's power , that would reign over their fellow creatures , which power assoon as one is subdued , another takes place , and will do so still , but the time comes , and the set time of i the all of all things is to be at an end , and when the fullness of these days shall be expired and accomplished , than one power shall not destroy another to set himself in power to rule over his fellow creatures , no but that power shall destroy all powers besides myself , as honour and riches shall be destroyed , and so the root destroyed , that i the Lord of host May be all and in all . 

And the word of the Lord came again saying , behold , and lo i saw men and women runnnig together , and every one said , save my god , save my god : as if men and women had each of them a god , which god must now be destroyed , and i looked to see what their gods were that there was such running up and down to save them , and lo , i saw one company , and their gods were gold and silver , but this god was destroyed ; and another company made houses , and another made their lands , but these gods i saw destroyed ; another made their pride and honour , but these gods were destroyed also ; and so one after another they were all destroyed , even all those things which men and women have run a whoring after must be destroyed and brought to nothing : and i said , Lord , what meaneth the persons to call these their gods ? and my excellent majesty at whose bright appearing all things besides himself must be destroyed , who will now suddenly appear to make men weep and howl for the miseries that are now a coming upon them , said on this manner as followeth , they call these their gods because they have set their hearts more upon these things then upon me and have with all eagerness run after these things ; but i at my appearing destroys them all , and so will take from earthly creatures those things wherein they have put most trust and confidence in , and will destroy them in their sight , even their gods of silver and gold , and will make them throw away their pictures . 

And again the word of the Lord said , behold , and lo i saw a company of men with their hands upon their loins , weeping and wailing , crying out for help : and i said , Lord what meaneth these to be so feeble and to stand as they do crying for help ? and my eternal God said , these men represent all my enemies , and all my saints enemies , & as they stand with their hands on their loins crying for help , it shows that i the Lord of host have strike them with fear and terror , even i have taken their strength from them , and they shall become as weak as water , even so weak that one shall slay a 100 and a 100 slay 10000 for all their strength was taken from them : so that i am confident 1. will make nothing to slay 1000 if it doth please God to bring his enemies in such a condition : which prophecy i look to see fulfilled in the year of redemption of the creation from bondage , which will be a year of jubilee , and this jubilee is at hand ; for i the Lord of host comes , and will not tarry , but will arise like a man of war , tearing and devouring in sunder all my enemies , and will consume them by the breath of my nostrils , & they shall not be able to stand : for i will tread & trample on them in the fierceness of my wrath , & will make them come bowing down to the soals of the feet of my saints , & will give the strength , & glory , & honour to my saints , and they shall rejoice and sing for ever & ever . 

And the word of the Lord came again saying , behold what dost thou now see ? and lo i beheld a woman gloriously arrayed with a sceptre in her hand , and she had a maid to wait upon her : and i said Lord , what meaneth this ? and my god the most high Jehovah , answered me and said , this woman represents the sons and daughters of Zion , and as you saw her with a sceptre in her hand , it denotes unto you that she hath power and strength over all her enemies , and so is a conqueror over them all , and so hath them in subjection , be her enemies great or small , more or less , so than the time is now a coming that Zion shall rejoice and be glad , and shall sing for joy of heart when her enemies shall stand a far off and weep for bitterness of spirit , and as you saw her gloriously arrayed , it shows that the sons and daughters of Zion shall have of the best , they shall eat and drink of the best , and wear of the best : not that they shall have the others ( Which are those whom God in love doth not make out himself unto ) in bondage & slavery , and so deprive them of the outward creatures , no , but they shall have the use of the creation , as to have their fill with food and all necessaries belonging to the body : so they shall in this sense be their servants , as is showed by the maid waiting on the woman . 

And presently after , i saw one in glory with an army following him , and he cut down his enemies a pace , and left none to oppose him , and of a sudden i saw all his enemies destroyed , for this form of glory is the mighty God that is now risen to take vengeance on his enemies and to make them his footstool , and his armies are his ministering spirits , by which he will confound all the glory , honour , and strength of men , yea even bring to nothing all the glory and powers of all fleshly powers how high soever they be lifted up , for alas poor flesh what art thou now in my hands ? I am now risen to judge thee , to burn thee up , and so to bring thy flesh to nothing , yea i will not leave thee root or branch , for there shall not be son or nephew , but i , even i the mighty Jehovah will make a short work , for i will work , and who art thou that shall hinder me from doing my purpose ? Therefore rejoice and sing for joy of heart , for behold i come , even i thy King o Zion , shout , shout and spare not ; lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and say my god reigns , even thy holy King of Zion : therefore sing aloud , and let the high praises of God be in thy mouth and a sharp two-edged sword in thy hand , and so execute vengeance on them that know not me ; bind their Kings and great men in fetters of iron , and execute the doom that is written , even utter desolation upon all the high and lofty ones , bring them to utter confusion , that they May howl and weep , because they have made you even my chosen ones , to be in slavery to them , therefore rejoice o ye daughters of Zion , and shout o daughters of Jerusalem , for they King cometh , and he is meek and lowly , riding upon an as , and upon a colt the foal of an ass , sing and rejoice for joy though ye be never so much despised , he , even i the King of glory comes riding upon an ass , even upon such poor despised & harmless creatures , that are willing to bear any burdens that are laid upon them , even such do i the King of glory delight to appear in , and not in high and lofty horses , such as are puffed up in their high conceits , having a form of godliness , and so runs from scripture to scripture , and by their fleshly wisdom would have it as they please ; no , but even in such do i come , that with a meek and quiet spirit have waited upon me : therefore ye meek and despised ones sing and rejoice , and go with joy , for behold i come , even i the Lord of host , and all your enemies shall be your footstool ; for you shall now tread Satan under your feet , and that by the strength of i your almightiness dwelling in you . 

And again the word of the Lord said , behold , and lo , i looked and i saw the appearance of seven hearts , and they did for a little while oppose one another , but at length they were still and left off striving one with the other and were all united together as one , and so became one . And i said Lord , what meaneth these hearts to be thus joined together of a sudden ? and my almightiness , even the eternal God , by whom all creatures were made , and by whom all creatures shall be brought to nothing , said on this manner as followeth , these seven hearts represent my sons and daughters that are now under several dispensations opposing one another in their judgements , one saying this is the way , another saying that is the way , and so by reason of their difference oppose one another , and it is out of a selfish disposition that rules in them , one would be fain esteemed above another by reason of his knowledge in the scriptures , which knowledge i am now about to confound , and all their fleshly knowledge , let them go under what notion soever , and for that way of baptism which is now practised and do hold communion with none but those that are of their own judgements , but are bitter and envious against those that are not of their way , judgeing and censuring them to be a persons that slight i the Lord of host , and so are not my beloved , and not those whom i will have regard unto , but now in the day of my power , i will take away that stone of stumbling , i will break them and confound them , and so will make them to see that they make much of the shell when the kernel is gone , and will make them to know that those whom they looked upon as not worthy to be called brethren , are the choice spouse of i the Lord of host , and so will turn unto the persons a pure language , that May all serve me with one consent , i will even in such a clear way make out myself unto them , that they shall all see and know , and all speak by my spirit . 

And i saw in a vision all manner of beasts and kinds of creatures , and i was commanded to slay and eat : notwithstanding they were none of my own , and my excellent majesty the King of eternal glory said , i will make all men know in a short time that what they possess is not their own , but all their treasures are mine , even i the Lord of host will recover my wool and my flox , even those treasures which they have made use of , and i will take them from them and will make them know that they shall now be for the use of my saints , even for the use of those whom they do most despise ; and if any say why do they take away my goods , as my corn and my wine , and my horses , and my cattle ? then shall even those whom i draw up into my love and favour say , we have need of them , and we in the name of our creator take them for to make use of them , or the Lord hath need of them , and therefore we take them ; and what will you say to this oh you great men that have abundance ? this privilege is and will in a more clearer manifestation made out whereby the saints even poor despised sectaries shall see and know that all things are theirs , whether it be Paul or Apollo , or Cephas , things present , or things to come , all things are yours , and you are Christ's , and Christ is God's : here you May see that the saints by being Christ's sons have all things , yea the apostle tells them that all things are theirs , howl you therefore , for the rust of your gold and silver will now rise up in judgement against you , and it shall now torment you , and vex you ; even it will be such a terror to you , and you shall with speed throw it away , even i the Lord of host will make you throw away your idols of gold & of silver , and hide yourselves for fear of me , for whatsoever is in the shambles take and eat , for the earth is the Lords , and the fullness thereof ; all the earth is mine , even mine it is , and all the cattle of the field , therefore slay and eat , and have all things common , as my saints at the appearing of me in flesh had , and therefore be contented , oh you rich men , to give up , lest i smite you with a curse ; for behold i come and will make my saints break bread from house to house , as formerly they did ; and will make them for to have comunion , and all things common ; so that they shall not say this is mine , or that is mine ; but i will destroy this , and so i will destroy all self in them , and they shall now live in the pure enjoyment of i the Lord of host , breaking bread with singleness of heart from house to house : so that my sons and daughters shall live in more union than they do now , for now they are ready to cut and destroy one another for a little silver , which shall now perish and be accounted as nothing : even i will make all sorts of men freely give away that they have , and be contented to have nothing but what they shall have need of from day to day ; for i will make love and union to increase , that the whole earth shall be a treasure for all , and not for some ; so that according as they are in want , they shall have one shall have a special care over another ; for the enmity being taken away , and the curse removed from off the earth , self-love shall cease , and universal love shall flow in , and then righteousness shall look down from heaven , and spring out of the earth ; and there will be no complaining in our streets , as there is now , crying out for bread , bread , for the Lord's sake ; no , but this noise shall cease , and the saying of James come more into their minds : that they shall now not think it enough to say , be ye warmed , and so give the poor nothing , but only pity them and feed them with words , but they shall now say , come in , eat and drink with us , for you are the work of the Lord , and what we have now you May freely take , for the Lord of host hath now made bare his holy arms , and all the earth shall see the salvation of God , and all shall now know and see that the Lord hath redeemed the creation from bondage into the liberty of the sons of God ; all men shall be freed from the bondage and slavery they now are under , and shall now begin to see and know that it is a sin to have respect to one in glorious apparel , and say , pray Sir come you and sit up here , when you say to one in poor clothes , sit thou at our foot stool , for i the Lord of host will make you all know now that you are all of one blood , and so are all now fellow creatures , and that i have as much respect to one in poor clothes , as to one in gay ones ; and that i will make you know that it 's your duty for to love one another , even your enemies ; for if you fulfil the royal law according to scripture , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ; which is not for the present , who art thou that hath fulfilled this scripture that can say and thy conscience not accuse thee to thy face , that thou doth love thy neighbour as thyself ? but rather thy conscience will tell thee , that thou dost not love thy neighbour as thyself ; for if thou didst , thou wouldst not let thy neighbour be in want , but would have as much care of him as thyself ; if thou hast roast-meat , to let him have roast-meat ; and in so doing thou will fulfil this scripture : therefore yea that do plead for scripture so much , and make so gallant a show of religion as you do , consider the scriptures aforementioned , and you shall see that you live far short of fulfilling the scripture : for what soever you would that men should do unto you , even so do thou unto them , for this is the law and the prophets : wouldst thou have men to love you and do you good ? if thou wouldst then thou must love them and do them good : but indeed you will say , why should i love them , they are of a strange opinion : this is but the devil in you for hating your fellow creatures , which must be destroyed and brought to nothing , that i the Lord of host May be exalted ; which will not be till i make my strange work come to pass , as to destroy all self and private interest , of saying this is mine ; and when this is done , than you will love your neighbour as yourself , and then you shall see and know with the apostle , that all things are lawful for you , that is as the apostle knew that he Might do what he would do , and have what creatures he would have for food and raiment , in that they are all gods : so you shall now know that you May have the use of all , and see all to be yours , and that this is the work of God for to bring in universal love and freedom . 

And the Lord said behold , behold : what dost thou see ? lo i beheld , and there appeared a tree full of fruit ; and the fruit , much like to apples one part of them , and the other part of them like unto pears , and i said , Lord , what meaneth this tree ? and the Lord said , this tree doth represent Christ : that as thou seest fruit upon this tree , and it is very pleasant to see to : even so is Jesus Christ a tree of life that bears abundance of fruit , and as thou sawest these men and women gather this fruit and eat them , and presently there was new fruit in the room of that which was pulled off . 

These men and women represent my sons and daughters , who are always a feeding on Jesus Christ , and yet cannot make him to leave off bearing fruit : and as thou sawest that these men and women that pulled and ate did live for ever , and were not to die after it , doth show that my sons and daughters feeding on me the Lord of host , shall live for ever : for as thou sawest that this food was very pleasant ; even so am i the Lord of host to those that do delight in me . 

And moreover this tree doth set forth the tree that is spoken of in the revelations , to be a tree of life that shall heal the nations , for as thou did see this tree appear of a sudden with fruit thereon : even so will i the Lord of life , that lives for evermore , appear in such an hour , and at such a time , when most men little think of me , to the destruction of them , and bringing of them to nothing , that so i May appear to be the life of those that do now know me and enjoy me : for by my appearing will i make myself manifest to be the food that every one must eat of : and that all other food , which is not of me , must be brought to nothing : for as i am set forth by a tree , so will i appear in power to the confounding of those that feed not on me : and so will make wast all their gods which they have to feed upon besides me , and all and every one shall be brought to nothing , that i the Lord of host May be all and in all , and so exalted above all , to which i say amen . 

And presently after this there appeared a garden full of flowers , as to my thinking , i saw them like roses of all sorts , and cornations , pinks , and all manner of flowers , and i said , Lord , what doth these mean ? and the Lord said , these do represent abundance of joy , even the verities of joys which my sons and daughters shall have , even they shall enjoy the most precious and most pleasant jewels that are or can be ; for they shall have the use of all things that are precious , and shall have the enjoyment of all the treasures of the world , and nothing shall be unpleasant to them , but every thing shall give a good smell , and shall be very pleasant to them making of them to rejoice , and sing and set forth the praise of me the Lord of host : for as these flowers did smell most sweetly ; even so , saith the Lord of host , will i by my own power , make all things that appear now to be unsavoury or unpleasant , to give a most pleasant smell , and as thou didst see in this garden abundance of green herbs : these green herbs , doth set forth the flourishing conditions of my saints , even of my sons and daughters ; how that they shall grow and flourish in despite of all their enemies , for their bones shall flourish as an herb , and as herbs be good for all sorts of men and women , even so shall my sons and daughters be good for all ; and by their flourishing and growing up as calves in the stall , it shows that persons that are now kept in bondage , even the meaner sort , shall be by the flourishing condition of my sons and daughters , restored from that slavery and bondage as they are now kept under by rich men , so as they cannot enjoy the creatures of God so as to have their bells full even into such a condition shall they be restored as that they shall now enjoy the good creatures of God , and shall have enough of the outward mercies , as for the back and belly so that there shall be no complaining in the street . 

And presently after this , there appeared one that was very glorious , and he had a cup in his hand , and it was full , and he gave it to men and to women for them to drink , and i said , Lord , who doth this man represent ? and what doth his cup signify ? and what is in this cup ? and my excellent God the King of eternal glory said , by this man , is showed i the Lord of host , and the cup doth represent , that i the Lord of host have something for to make men and women drink of : these men and women represent my sons and daughters ; and that which was in the cup , which the men and women drank of was wine ; which holds forth thus much : that it is the pleasure of me the Lord of host , to give unto my sons and daughters for to drink-wine : for as much as wine is set forth to be a nourisher and cherisher of the nature of man , and as thou sawest them that did drink of the wine which i gave them were merry , and did fall to singing and to dancing : even so by my pouring forth of my spirit , or myself into my sons and daughters , so as to make myself manifest in a more clear discovery of myself to them , as to make them see and know that i the god of love , and peace , and glory , dwells in them , acts in them , and so doth all things in them , and that i have taken them up for to be my dweling place , and habitation , and that nothing can hurt them or do them any harm without me : will occasion them in like manner for to break forth and sing , and dance , and leap for joy of heart , being filled with new wine of the spirit : for put new wine into old bottles and they will burst if they have not vent , or else the old bottles will spoil the new wine : so i by filling my sons and daughters with myself , doth cause a spoil first to be made in the old bottles , their body , and then afterwards doth cause them to bring forth myself , and so do my will : though it be the pleasure of me their King to act them in such a way as will prove the ruin of their good name , yet they must do it ; for the wine of the spirit must have a vent , or else the body will break . 

And the word of the Lord came unto me saying , behold , and lo i looked , and there appeared a man , and he had in his hand a sharp knife , and he ripped up the bells of men and women , even of all sorts , under what religion soever they were termed to be : and i said , Lord , what is the meaning of this man that doth so as he doth . And the Lord said , this man represents me the Lord of host , and as thou did see him open them , it shows that i the Lord of host have a piercing eye to discern what is in them , and what they are , notwithstanding their outward professions , and outward shows of holiness , yet i the god of gods see all their inward parts , and know their secret thoughts , and the private intents of their hearts , and how full of hypocrisy they are , dissembling with me and men , and how they make religion a cloak for to hide their knavery , even because they May the better cousin and cheat their fellow creatures , and keep them in bondage and slavery ; and also from the enjoyments of the outward creation , which i have made for man , that they May have the use of them , of the outward creatures , and so live comforatbly by enjoying the fruits of the earth ; for the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof , and all things are mine even mine ; therefore the crying of the poor , and the hypocrisy of all sorts of men , makes me make haste to declare that i the Lord of host am now coming to judge the world with righteousness , and so to give them every one according to their deserts : but shall the son of man find faith on earth when be comes ? no , he shall not , for though i do declare myself by my servants the prophets , whom i stir up for to make out myself unto them ; yet i find and do see ; that amongst all sorts of men there is but little faith , for to believe that i the Lord of host am now ready to appear in power , and in glory , and in majesty , for to confound and bring to nothing all powers beside myself , and so to make bare my holy arm in all nations , and so to lay open all men's hearts , and make them see their folly for dissembling with me : for as thou saw'st them opened , and when they were opened to thy view , though before they seemed to be very white , yet even the most purest , especially those under the name of Presbyterians and independents , who seemed very white , that is , they had very magilded outsides , as forms and ways of worships , as observing of the Sabbath , and being zealous for they way of worship , even so zealous , as to judge , censure , and condemn those that were not of their opinion ; yet notwithstanding all this , their hearts are full of hpyocrisy ; showed by the blackness that was within them , and so instead of serving me , and bringing glory to my name , they make use of religion to serve their own ends , being as covetous , and as proud , and as full of ambition and cruelty as those that make no profession at all ; and likewise the church called the Anabaptists are linked much in your name , more for to make a show of religion , then to serve God , even i the god of gods , out of love , as is showed by your harsh judgement and censureing those that do outstrip , or those whom i the Lord of host am pleased to take up higher than you ; as such as are deluded and deceived by fancies , and by the devil , as it doth appear by your cruel words and speeches against them : therefore saith i the Lord of host , who sees your outward professions , and knows the secret thoughts and intents of your hearts , how that you do strive for to exalt yourselves , and so to make yourselves great , and are ready for to dissembly with me , the Lord of host , as though you knew not any god at all ; for dissembling , and lying , and cheating that reigns amongst you , and amongst all sorts of persons , ye have hardened you hearts as if the Lord had spoken to you , and had told you that you shall never fall , and so you prompt yourselves up in your ways , which i the Lord of host must destroy , even your church ways , that so i May torment you , and purify that blackness that remains under your gilded professions , and so draw you up unto me , even to a more nearness and oneness with me , that so lying and dissembling May be taken away from you , and so make you deal plainly with God , and with your fellow creatures ; and for the rest even those of the world , that have no knowledge of me , i must torment them , by destroying their gods , and bringing of them to nothing : yet i must tell you , that they are in one manner not so much to be blamed as you ; because they know nothing ; therefore i look that they should perform nothing : but you that know something , and profess me , and act and walk contrary to me , you are but dissemblers and hypocrites at the best ; for you know that you must love all men , and yet you hate all that differ from you in judgement , and so deserve to be a little more tormented for dissembling with yourselves ; i promise you you shall be tormented ; and though the world and you be given to dissembling and lying , and to eat and drink , and marry , and give one another in marriage , as the persons of old did , it is but what our saviour Jesus Christ did prophecy should be the condition of you in the last age ; but as i the Lord of host did forewarn my creatures , even man , and all creatures from destruction by my servant Noah , and made him a preacher of righteousness , for to tell them that destruction was coming upon them , and that they for their wickedness must be destroyed : even so have i now , even i the Lord of host , raised up a man , or two , or three , yea twenty , to testify that i the Lord of host will shortly appear , to confound and destroy all things by myself , as i did in the days of Noah : for the wickedness of this generation doth surpass the wickedness of those that were in those days , but as my servant Noah was mocked at , and laughed at , and also derided for telling of them that destruction was at hand , even so it is my pleasure now to send you a declaration , by one whom i have stirred up , and commanded him to put it in print , that you May see that i the Lord of host will come & confound you , and bring you to nothing , and destroy your gods , even your idols of gold and silver , & will make you throw them away : but hang it say you , this is a delusion , the devil is in him , & so hath filled him full of fancies , and hath distracted his brains , & hath made him mad , and so will rail against him , and revile and speak all manner of evil against him : this i know you will do , as they of old did unto my servant Noah : but remember that that day as Noah went into the ark which he builded , and all his family with him , and also all sorts of creatures , even than i the Lord of host did begin to pour out upon them the fierceness of my wrath , as i had told them by Noah , so you that mock , and laugh , and revile against my messengers now , & say the day of the Lord is not at hand as yet , for him to do such things , ( And therefore will not consider for to relieve the poor , and let the oppressed go free , and so to break the bands of wickedness but will still persist in the evil of your ways : as if you had no warning at all ; even for your own selves , when you think safety , and cry peace even then sudden destruction comes upon you , even when you little think of it , as it did upon the world of old , and then will i torment and plague you for despising my messengers and servants , and will be a terror and a dread to you , and you shall howl and weep , and my servants shall sing and rejoice for joy and gladness of heart ; for as Noah and all them that went in with him became one , and of one family , and all the creatures became one , as being in union and love one with another , even so will i now make all creatures , especially my sons and daughters , for to eat and drink together , and so to be of one family , and of one household , having all things common ; and will also make you that now revile them , be still and silent , and in pain for doing so , and i will make also all the creatures to be at love and peace one with the other , as they that were in Noah's ark together , so that there shall be peace and union . 

And the Lord said , behold what i will show thee ; and lo i looked , and there appeared a man , and he went up and down , gathering men together : and i said , Lord , what meaneth this man together men together ? and what men are these ? and my eternal God said , this man represents i the Lord of host , gathering my persons together : and i said , Lord , what persons ? and my God said , the Jews , that i May bring them in to believe on my name , and so to make them come with weeping and supplications , and and make them know that they have pierced me , and so have not been in my way as to see and know that Jesus Christ their King and saviour is already come , but their eyes have been blinded and hardened , so that they could not see as yet : but though they have fell , yet i the Lord of host , will graft them into the vine again , and they shall see and know that i have according to my promise sent them a saviour and a King already , whom they have crucified , and i will now make them see and know that they have crucified the King of the Jews in their own land , for which cause i have dispersed them , and made them to be a persons scattered in all nations ; and all persons have had them at command , so that they have been the reproach of the heathen , and all the heathen or aliens from me the Lord of host , hath persecuted them , and have shed their blood , but i will now even in the fullness of time open their eyes , that they shall see and know , that they have crucified Christ their King , whom all their prophets made mention of , and all their levitical observations did typify out : which King they shall now see was not to come at that time to deliver them from bondage of other nations , but shall now even at this time which is to come , see and know that all faces shall be made black with paleness , and a noise from a amongst them shall come forth , that the Lord hath founded Zion , and the poor of the persons shall trust in it ; even i will make my persons now come with singing , and with rejoicing , because i have opened their eyes , and have taken out their stony hearts , and have given them hearts of flesh , even such hearts , as they shall no longer deny that Jesus their saviour is come , but shall confess that he is come , and that they have crucified him ; and so shall see that i have caused them to be in such a condition as they are now in : for it was my good pleasure that it should be so ; but now will i rise , and will show my power for to redeem them from this Egyptian bondage they are now in ; even as i did appear for their fathers of old , and did bring them from the land of Egypt by my mighty and strong hand , by my servant Moses , whom i did stir up for that purpose : even so will i make my power seen in all nations , by stirring my servants up , and also by sending them a leader for to lead them , as my sons of old had , and as all Kings and great men fell that opposed them , even so will i make all for to fall and perish , and become as weak as water , that so i May bring you into your own land again ; and all those that hinder you or rise in arms against you , shall be drowned in my wrath and sore displeasure , even as Pharaoh of old was drowned in the red sea , so i will set me glory and honour , and will make you appear to be Kings and conquerors , through me that love you ; and so will bring you into your one land with joy and gladness , and there will make you for to lie down in peace , and to be at rest , when i will torment and trouble all nations that have fought against you , and they shall weep , and howl , and cry out for sorrow of heart ; but i will make you my chosen ones , and also them whom i will bring up with you , and have called them by my name , to come and go up to the height of Zion , with everlasting songs , singing and rejoicing with abundance of joy , in that i have create Jerusalem a joy , and her persons a rejoicing : for i will make a new heaven , and a new earth , wherein righteousness shall dwell , for i will make desolation , and will destroy all things that are now at the present , and so will make all things new ; new in respect that i have gathered you out of all countries , and have once again brought you into your own land , for to make you the joy , and the praise of the whole earth ; and the place and land where i will in glory delight to dwell ; and so will make all your enemies come bowing and bending and submit unto that hath and will still bring you in the everlasting joy , where all is joy , and all shall be joy and peace ; so that they shall bring ( Even your enemies ) their treasures and riches , and the fullness of the gentiles shall be brought in : rejoice and sing , and shout oh ye daughters of Jerusalem ; for behold , i will come , and will take all sorrow from you , and ye shall see evil no more , and i will make all your enemies your footstool ; and all evil shall cease from amongst you , and i will make the days of your mourning to end , and so will make everlasting joy to show itself , and you shall sorrow no more : behold i come , even i that will save you from all sorrow , and from the cruelty of men , and will make bare my holy arm , and all the nations shall see the salvation of God , even all persons shall see and know that i have redeemed you , and saved you , and have gathered you from among the heathen , and have brought you into your own land , there for to make you the praise of the whole earth ; and all the glory of nations shall be brought into it , even into that city , where nothing but righteousness shall dwell , and all dogs , and sorcerers , and whosoever they be that have not right to the tree of life shall not enter into this city , even into this new Jerusalem , which shall be made the praise of the whole earth ; for this Jerusalem consisteth of all the sons and daughters of Zion , who shall be brought out of all countries , and out of all nations , into this land which i have chosen , for to make myself a glorious name , and so to make my name a terror and a dread to all that come not into this city ; for without are none but forcerers , and such as makes a lie , as dogs and such filthy creatures ; for dogs are a most beastly creature , and seem to be a creature good for little , even here such as are to be left out are compared to dogs ; for all dogs are cruel and envious , and are ready to destroy themselves by fighting one with another , and also their condition is , they always are grumbling and snapping one at another , as striving for mastery ; so are these persons that are to be left out of this city , a persons who have given themselves over to rule and domineer over their fellow-creatures , and would have all in subjection to them , and they would be Lords , and so would have their fellow-creatures in bondage to them , and keep them as servants and bondmen , even for to work and labour for them , when they themselves have all the joy and pleasure ; but now , even upon such dogs , that have risen from Cain and Nimrod the mighty hunter , that have hunted , and also have catch their fellow-creatures in their snare , and so esau-like , would have all in subjection to them , even upon such shall my hand fall very heavy , as for to plague them , and so to punish them , that i May make them know that my time is now at hand , for to give redemption to my creatures , especially to my sons and daughters , whom ye Esau's , and great men , have kept in bondage and slavery , and so to make them a joy and rejoicing , singing for joy and gladness of heart , where ye Esau's brood that have a long time reigned over them , shall be trodden as straw under foot , and be fit for nothing but to be left without , even without my joy and love , because of your sorceries , because of your estrangness from me ; Counting all your pleasures and happiness to be in things here below even in outward substance , treasuring up gold and silver , which hath bewitched you from the truth , and would not let you hear that the best and chiefest commandment is , for to sell and give to the poor , but when this hath buzzed in your ears , and your own conscience accusing you for it , you have like the young man in the gospel , as you call it , which fain would go to heaven , and so have rest , but loathe to fulfil our saviour's command ; sell that which thou hast and give to the poor , and so thou shalt have treasure in heaven , as if my son Christ had said , do not you think that by observing a little outward way of worship , and so walking on in forms , and making an outward profession of religion , having a form of godliness , that you shall enter into my rest , not knowing that you are bewitch from me , in that you make so much of an outward estate , as of houses , and lands , and also of gold , and silver , wherein you put more trust and confidence then in me ; therefore it is but just for me the Lord of host to deal , or to give you such a hard lesson for you to learn , sell all thou hast and give to the poor , for they have need of it , even of my money , & , houses and lands ; which if you do not , you are like to incur my sore displeasure , and so to be deprived of my rest , for not submitting to this my command ; which is one of the greatest commandments , as that thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself : but oh thou proud Esau , and haughty Lucifer , that exalts thyself above thy fellow-creatures , what says thou to this ? do i command thee for to sell that which thou hast and give to the poor ? and thou instead of doing so , dost quite contrary , even the oppress them , and cousin and cheat them , and bring them before the judgement-seat haling them to prisons , do you think for this that i will be as , well pleased with you as if you had done what i commanded you to do ; sell that which thou hast and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ? which if thou dost not , i will shut thee out of my love and favour , and so thou shall not enter into the city wherein my glory shall be manifested , and made for to outshine all the glory of the world , because thou art disobedient to me , and wilt not love thy neighbour as thyself , according as i have commanded thee to do , but dost still persist in hording up of corn , and money , and all the best of the things of the world for thy own private use , and so will not give to the poor , but doth Count thy honour for to have abundance of the riches of this world , and will live very gallantly , & go in the best , and eat of the best , when thy fellow-creatures have none of the worst , whom i love as well as you ; but o! thou proud Esau that exalts thyself above thy fellow-creatures , i will reason with you , how or wherein dost thou fulfil my will ? I commanded thee , for to sell that thou hast , and give away , but that thou hast not , done : thou wilt have houses and lands of thy own , and gold and silver in bags and chests , when others have none ; and will not if you hear one of your fellow-creatures cry for the Lord sake give me something , you will turn your ears from the crying of the poor , and will tell a lie too , and say , you have nothing , when you have something ; though they asked in my name , yet you will not give ; though i command thee for to give all that thou hast ; but thou wilt make a lie to save that which i have commanded thee , even all you that have abundance : to give unto thy fellow-creatures : for liars are and shall be without : and again how dost thou love thy neighbour as thyself , when thou eatest of the best , and drinks of the best , and wears of the best , and lives at ease , freeing yourselves from hard labour , which thy poor neighbours are made for your cruelty over them to undergo ? therefore consider this , left i take you away from your own pleasures , as you call it , from eating of the best , and drinking and wearing of the best , and instead of it , give you rags to put on , and the worst for you to eat and drink , even curse your dainty things , and make all things become gall and wormwood ; because you break this commandment of mine : love thy neighbour as well as thyself : which if you did fulfil , which is my pleasure you should ; then would you give to your poor neighbours such things as yourselves have : if you yourselves have roast-meat , then would you give them roast-meat , or see that they have roast-meat ; if you yourselves have good drink , than would you see that they should not drink water , but have good drink : if you yourselves have good clothes , than would you see that they should have good clothes , and so would not let them go naked ; but would be like my servant Job , give bread to the hungry , and clothes to the naked ; if you yourselves have ease and rest from labour , than you would not see them labour like horses , and take no pity of them ; neither would you then give yourselves over to be so cruel and hard hearted , as to make slaves of your fellow creatures , whom i command you to love as well as yourselves : but here you May see how you slight me , and how little you regard me ; instead of doing what you should do , you do that you should not : i command you for to love your neighbour , and instead of my command , you hate your neighbour : but do you think this May serve my turn , or that i will be pleased for you to do so as you do ? no , i will not be pleased with you , unless you fulfil my commandments , as in love thy neighbour as well as thyself : which if you did , you would •••••…te them : but you May say , they are my enemies , and shall i love them as well as myself ? though they are your enemies , it is my pleasure that you should love them as well as yourself : love your enemies , saith my son Christ , bless them , and pray for them ; that you May show yourselves to be like my father which is in heaven : but if you do not love your enemies , neither your neighbour , it shows that you do not fulfil my command ; neither are you like me , who loves all , and causes my rain to rain on the unjust as well as on the just : but you cannot abide to hear of these things ; to let your neighbours be as yourselves ; by reason of that proud flesh , that rules and domineers in you , as to make you think better of yourselves than you are ; esau-like ruling and domineering over Jacob , but i will cut you short , and will make you , notwithstanding you go to church , and here sermons and have your children baptised , as you call it , and observe Sunday ; that you have disobeyed my voice , and have not walked humbly with me ; and so you are no other but sorcerers , such as must not come into my place where i will make my name known more than in any place , which shall be Jerusalem the city of the living King ; whether i will gather my sons and daughters out of all countries , to go thither and you that have loved to make a lie shall be shut cut even with dogs and sorcerers , and so having no right to the tree of life must not enter into the city : but they that have right to the tree of life , shall enter in , even into my rest and joys , for the Jerusalem which i have built , and will gather my sons and daughters thither for to be tire place which i have appointed to be the glory of the earth ; and all the nations of the earth , even the great men , as well as Kings , and nobles , and others , that heap up corn and money , they shall bring their treasures and jewels thither , and i will make them to rejoice in me , and i will joy over them and rejoice in the midst of them ; i will be their God , and they shall be my persons , even my chosen and peculiar ones , in whom i have delighted to dwell , and will dwell ; and make them to be full of joy and glory , even the glory of all the world ; and all the world shall become subject to me i the Lord of host in my persons , in my bride and spouse and chosen peculair ones , in whom i will manifest myself to be a God of power dwelling in them , and they shall dwell in me , and they shall know that i the Lord of host dwell in them , and will make them to be a terror and a dread to all persons , and all persons that shall hear of my infinite goodness , which i will manifest to them , shall even weep and howl , and gnaw their tongues for pain and anguish , which shall fall upon them , being sensible of that joy , pleasure , delight and glory of that love and favour which i will make out to my chosen & peculiar ones , and nothing shall more torment them then the seeing and beholding my almightiness ruling in them , making others to be as nothing in comparison of them , this i say shall torment you , even you oh proud and stout ones , that are loathe to be pulled out of your thrones of glory , as to be deprived of that self & fleshly ruling power which in you , but though thou art to be deprived of it , yet thou shalt even of a sudden , yea in an hour when thou art ready to cry peace , peace , and so to flatter thyself in thy own fleshly pampe , to strive after riches and honour , and so to get thyself a great name : as when you have a abundance of oxen and cows , and two or three farms and perhaps bushels of money keeping poor creatures under you , even thy fellow creatures ; thus crying peace , and see no likelyness of a change , thou wilt not be mindful of what i send unto you : but will make slight of this business ; not remembering Paul's expressions , when you cry peace , peace , behold sudden destruction is upon you : even a consumption to all your outward glory , for a fire is kindling from me the Lord of host , which shall enter into you , and burn you , until all things are according to my will and pleasure ; for this fire is my spirit , which shall burn up all your fleshly pomp , and riches , and houses , and shall bereave you of all your gods , even your gods of gold and silver , and of worships , and houses , and lands , which you have made jodls of : even i the Lord of host will consume your glory , and honour , and will lay it to the dust ; and thou self-interest that says this is mine , and that is mine , shall utterly be consumed by my bright appearing , and i will make you throw away your idols of gold , and silver , and also your lands , which now you possess , and your oxen , and horses , and all things , i will make you say they are the all of all things , even mine the eternal God , and so say to your fellow creatures whom now we have made slaves of , we have nothing of our own , for if this be not sufficient warrant or message for to make you relieve the widow and the fatherless , and so disperse abroad , telling of them it is yours and not mine ; i will come with a far greater torment , and will appear in such fury , that i will make you think that you see the devil standing by you at all times tormenting you , and plaguing you , because you do not give up : therefore give up before i destroy you in my wrath and fury , for i am now risen to call all my stewards to an account , even you mighty ones unto whom i have lent much ; but finding of you to be very cruel to your fellow-creatures , and that you have not dealt faithfully with them , i come to judge you , and to call you to an account ; for your wickedness is so often in my ears , that i can stay no longer : therefore i pass this sentence against you , oh rich men ; that i will utterly destroy you , and bring you to nothing , yea i will torment you day and night , that so i May make you know that the last days are now at hand , which my servant Paul spoke of , even the day is now at hand , that they that are married , shall be as if they were not , and they that use the world as if they used it not : why so , as if you should say ; the same apostle gives a reason ; for says he , the fashion of this world passeth away : oh you rich men , leave off hording of gold and silver , least the rust and canker rises in your conscience , and so makes you hang or drown yourselves , and so you run yourselves into a pit of misery , even into hell , for the married shall be as if they were unmarried ; that is , i by my bright appearing will so powerfully manifest myself , that i will be a sharp two edged sword , cutting and devouring in sunder all the ways that have been acted contrary to me that is now on foot : for i will gather my own together from the power of their enemies , that if any of mine , whether man or woman , be joined together to one , that is , of my stock , nor will have no heed to my voice , if it be a man , he May freely leave his wife ; if a woman she May freely leave her husband , and in my sight do it lawfully , because the time is now at hand that those that are married are as if they were unmarried & i for this end and purpose , even i the Lord of host will have it to be so : that i May separate the just and unjust , that i May gather my sons and daughters out from amongst their hateful enemies , and bring them into their own country ; which shall be the Jerusalem that now lies wast : but it shall be inhabited once again , and made to be the praise of the whole earth : therefore flee every one of you out of Babylon , for her judgements are great and reaches to the skies ; and go you up into your own country , and there declare the praises of God : first i would have my persons go out of Babylon , which if they do , they must not tarry here , or in any place wherein i do not appear for to speak to them : but come you my sons and daughters out of Babylon , your captivity , and bondage , and come with me out of this confusion , and out of these false ways and governments , and forms of worships : for i must pour out my judgement upon them all , and i will plague all them that will hinder you from doing my will , as to keep you that you shall not come from them , even every thing that they have shall be a devil to them , especially to those that do not give up and say to their poor fellow-creatures , these oxen , and cows , horses , bread , wine , corn , clothe , and all things are yours , as well as mine , but when i have brought you out from amongst them , even into your own country , than you shall be at rest ; for it is Zion , the place that i have chosen to dwell in , and will dwell in , even in your oh Zion , whom i will by my strong hand bring back into your own land , even you Jews which at the present seems to be a persons scattered and peeled amongst other persons , even you will i bring , with the fullness of the gentiles ; and will make you rejoice , and sing , and leap for joy , for the Lord , the King , the holy one of Israel is in thee , even in every one of you , and none of you shall see evil any more ; oh what a abundance of joy will here be ! Oh you Jews natural , that have a long time been strangers , but are now called in , and grafted into the true vine again , and for you also that are gentiles by name , but are taken up with the love and favour of God , even i the mighty Jehovah , for you shall be both of you united together , and be but one body and spouse of the King of glory : from whom i the King of glory have wiped away all evil , and you shall see sorrow no more ; but shall rejoice in me , as a bride doth in the bridegroom , and so also will i rejoice in you , as my wife and bride and thee only in whom i do delight to dwell , when others shall be tormented and grieved with my sore displeasure , and with that work , i am about for to make them do : which is for to make the riches which they have made gods of , become devils to torment them that they May remember the words of Paul , the time is coming that they shall use the world as if they used it not : but oh you rich ones , how do you do at this saying , you must use the world as if you used it not ? which if you did , you would not do as now you do , lay up treasures for the rust and canker to get at , to be a witness against you , or for you ; to lay up great store of riches , is to use the world as if you would never part from it , or as if that should never be taken from you , which i tell you , it must be taken from you , and you also made to throw away your gods of gold and silver , and also all other things , as to claim no right to them more than another man ; in so doing you May be said to use the world as if you used it not , and not while you do so , will this saying be fulfilled which shall surely come to pass , for the fashion of this world passeth away , but how May it be said , that the fashion of this world goeth away ? the fashion of this world passeth away when that which was once in high esteem goeth out , and instead thereof there cometh a thing that is in opposition of what was before ; that which was highly esteemed of before , now grows out of date , and that which was not before comes now in , the fashion of this world hath been in whole and in general amongst all sorts of men under what notion of religion soever , to get riches and strive after them with all eagerness , as May be thereby thinking to get in estimation of the world , and so to be in great esteem among the rich ones of the earth , and also the fashion of this world hath been to lie , cousin , and cheat , and also to make war one with another , one fighting against the other , with all might and strength , and only through a self and private interest , which hath occasioned so much blood to be spilt , and also hath occasioned many poor creatures to starve for want of food , and others have been driven to extreme poverty , as to steal for something whereby to keep life in the body , and all this hath been done by the pleasure of my own self , even i the Lord of host , who hath and will suffer the things of my appointment to run their own course , until they come to their end , but now these things being almost at an end , the word must become new , new in respect of what is now a coming on the world , that as the world hath former lie strove after , shall now become loathsome and abominable & most men shall see & know it to be so , for riches shall now be a hook which shall be ready to choke , those that have them , and so they shall see their folly in laying up treasures for they know not who ; for what treasures soever , or how much soever they be , must now be brought out ; for the day of the Lord is at hand , which will consume all things besides himself , and so will make that a plague which formerly hath been the joy and delight of most men , even of all men : for former things are passed away , and all things must become new , for this Jerusalem mentioned so often in scripture , must now be established above the hills and mountains , which formerly hath been kept under by the power of man , but the world passeth away , gold and silver that hath been made gods of , will now be as plenty as it was in Solomon's days , and as there were no beggars in Israel , so now there shall be none to beg any more ; for former things are passed away , the saying this is mine , and this is mine , shall not long continue ; but at the end there shall be a change , which shall be very suddenly , to the amazement of all worldlings , and those that make riches their god , for these things go out of date , for now the time is at hand that we shall follow the practice of the apostles , and so shall hear them preach , and to break bread from house to house with singleness of heart , and so shall not so much look to ourselves , as to let others be neglected , no , but we shall see to others , that they shall be in no want , and so shall have no want of any thing , which if we do , then shall we not only talk of denying ourselves , but we shall wholly deny ourselves , and shall not seek our own good , our own i say , and not another , but with all willingness seek the good of others , as being fellow-creatures , and all of one blood , made of one and the same metal ; then shall wars and contention cease , and nothing but love grow and increase , and spring forth in abundance ; for i the Lord of host will make all my enemies to lie down and be at rest one with the other , so that they shall lie like a lamb and a sheep together ; and as for bears and wolves , they shall be taken away , that there May be no devouring , but there May be perfect peace , and love one with another ; for though i do gather my saints out of all nations to go to one place , even to Jerusalem , so that they shall be freed from their cruel enemies , yet will i also make such a work in all the earth , that oppression shall cease amongst them ; even those that are not brought into my love and favour , shall live and be quiet one with the other , and shall have all things common ; but for my saints , which have right to the tree of life , and so enter in through the gates into the city , shall not be twain but shall be all one , both of one heart and one mind ; for i the Lord of host , will preach to them , and they shall hear me preach , and shall learn knowof me , even so much , that they shall see and know that they possess all things , and enjoy all things , and so have all things at command ; for this tree of life is myself , which if a man eats of , he shall live for ever , and also this tree of life , is in the city ; which city May be taken two ways , either mystical , or literal , mystically , the saints makes one city , literally , it is the Jerusalem where my sons and daughters shall be gathered together ; the gates of this city is my power , which all must be endued with before they can enter into it : for the tree of life is myself , which will be there for ever , keeping of them , my sons and daughters always in a continual supply , so that they shall have no want of anything , but the riches of the gentiles shall be brought into this city , even into this new Jerusalem , whose children shall be all righteous , and nothing but righteousness shall dwell there , nothing but the pure & chosen vessels of my love shall be there even with singing , & dancing shall they come thither , and leaping for joy , for the Lord hath founded Zion , and the poor of the persons shall trust in it : oh Zion shout , shout and sing for joy , for all persons shall tremble and quake for fear of thee , even for fear of thy most excellent King , i the mighty Jehovah that dwells in thee , and i will make thee to be famous , and thee to be desired far among all persons ; this word shout , shows abundance of joy , joy unspeakable in thee , shout and be glad , nothing but rejoice and sing : let sorrow and sighing , and whatsoever hath formerly troubled thee , be now turned into joy and gladness ; i tell thee , that thou shalt be made the praise of the whole earth ; even thou ( Oh Zion ) that hath been scattered and driven into all nations , here and there one , but now i have founded Zion , even thee , oh Zion , wherein i do delight to dwell , and will bring thee into my own place , even into a Canaan of rest , from all thy hateful enemies ; so that thou shalt no longer be here and thereon , no , but i will bring you all together , both Jews and gentiles , and i will make you to be both one , rejoicing in you , and will be married to you , and you shall be my spouse , and my wife , who shall always be feeding on the tree of life ; and so i will make you live for ever : for all my joy and delight shall be in you , and i will be your tower , and rock , and walls , and salvation for you ; and in that day you shall say , we have a strong city ; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks ; even a free universal liberty from all sorts of enemies both within and without , and nothing but joy and love all being knit together in love , rejoicing in love heaving so strong a city , and all manner of precious things being there , even such a city and place for delight , that there shall be none like it in the world ; for nothing but joy will i give you , and will make you for to rejoice in me your King of glory , and you shall be as so many Kings and Princes that shall reign here on earth , every one of you no less than a King , that shall have all nations in subjection to you , by my mighty power which i will manifest in you , i will make you to break the nations in pieces like potter's vessels , even into , shivers shalt thou dash all thine enemies , whether they be Turk or : Pope , or any other countries , for all shall become as weak as water ; & i in the midst of you will show myself to be strong and powerful ; even so strong , that i will make all nations to be silent , and sit still , and let you alone , and instead of making wars against you , they shall beat their swords , and spears , and their weapons of war into pruning hooks , and the nations shall not learn war any more ; but i will make them say , come let us go up to Zion , and they will teach us their ways oh what a abundance of glory will i give unto thee oh Zion , that nations far and near shall come up to thee to be taught of thee ; and indeed they shall have great need , for i will empty all other teachings of men , and all shall be barren , so that there shall be no perfect rest but to those that come to Zion , where i the Lord of host will be the a loan teacher , and will make them all to know me , even from the least to the greatest ; not only know me , and call me God , because of my power being seen , in that i have made the heavens and the earth , for this knowledge of me all men have , yet they are ignorant of what i am ; which my persons that dwell in Zion shall know ; they shall see me in my glory , and know me what and where i be , they shall see me everywhere , and know that i am in every thing , and that the whole world is but a garment to cover me from the visible sight of men : and thus will i appear in my persons , gathering them together , where i will manifest myself unto them , and raise them from the dead , even all Israel from this death of sin and corcuption ; and will make them to be partakers of the second resurrection , on which the first death shall have no power ; and so all Israel , even the whole house of Israel , shall be gathered together in righteousness and in truth , and they shall glory and rejoice in me , even in mount Zion ; yea even the place where my son Jesus was transfigured and changed , so that his raiment became white and glistering , and the two apostles seeing of him in this condition , said it is good to be here ; for the glory that was seen there , which was but a resemblance of my gathering my persons to Zion , and so making them to be as one , and when i had so gathered them together in the last days , there to make my glory shine in a more lustrious and glorious manner then ever i did when my son Jesus was on the earth , for his being transfigured and shining so bright , shows forth abundance of light and glory that shall be manifested to you now in these last days ; for as soon as he was in garments that were white and glistering , it shows that i will appear to be a light , and a more excellent light to you then yet i have been , for the glory was so great at the transfiguration of my son , that made his disciple say , it was good for them to be there : even so shall my appearing in you and gathering of you together , shining in you , and among you in so glorious a manner , rocking you a sleep in my glory , shall make you say it is good for us to be here , even in this place where it is thy pleasure we shall be ; for here shall we be in the same condition as the two dissciples were in ; for at the transfiguring of thyself , made them to say , it was good for to be here , by reason of the more transcendent glory they saw far more than they did before , notwithstanding they had a long time been in Jesus his company ; so that notwithstanding those glorious discoveries which you have had of me , and those glorious breakings forth of light which hath been among you , will appear to be nothing in comparison of that light and glory you shall have when you are taken apart from the persons , as the two apostles were had in the mount , even then shalt thou see a more glorious discovery of me , when thou art taken wholly out of Babylon , and wholly from all thy enemies , and brought up into the mount even into Jerusalem the place which i will adorn with all manner of precious things ; as jewels of gold , and pearls and precious , stones of all sorts : and i will change these glimpse of light and glory which thou now hast , and these little sparks of light , into a full and perfect view , wherein thou Mayst see clearly my light and glory , and so these sparks become coals of fire that shall appear in a more fuller manner to thee then ever they did before ; which will be in such an extraordinary manner that all things else shall become nothing in comparison of this glory which i will now make you to see . 

And whereas Jesus was transfigured before his two disciple , and they saw him in glory , and he was not alone in this condition but they did see Moses and Elias talking with him , this is a mystery which shows , that i the Lord of host appearing in my bright and glorious dispensations , which will now be , i shall appear alone ; but as Moses and Elias was with Christ when , he was transfigured , even so shall Moses and Elias now be with me in my bright appearing to you ; and not only Moses and Elias , but all that have been my faithful servants , even the whole house of Israel shall appear in glory , and you shall see and know them that they are Moses and Elias , and the rest of my saints , whom i have now raised up to come and be with you , and have given them a body as i have seen good , and Enoch of old prophesied ; the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints , so now will i come ( Not only with ten thousand , but ) with all my saints to guard and keep me company , and so will make my name a glorious name , and a memorial for ever ; and i thus appearing in glory and majesty , will make all my enemies to tremble and to quake , when they shall hear that i the Lord doth reign in mount Zion , and that i have brought Moses and Elias , and all the rest of the prophets thither : there for to make thee rejoice in me the Lord of host , clothing them with myself , and making them for to appear in glory , giving them a reward , that they shall come and be in my love and favour , and that they shall now rule over all their enemies , and all their enemies shall be but their footstool , and they shall now tread and trample that wicked spirit which hath often persecuted them , to nothing ; and so now shall appear to be Kings and conquerors through me that love them : here is but a glimpse of that glory which you shall enjoy when you come to Zion , when you see me and all my saints with me , rejoicing in me , and i in them ; but how ever know this , that Zion shall be made the praise of the whole earth , and all glory shall be there , even all manner of precious things ; and all the nations shall lie down in their dust and be brought to shame and confusion and the Lord alone shall be exalted , and will magnify himself , and will get him glory and honour over all his enemies , and so will bring to nothing all those that have opposed him , and will make Zion a scourge and a torment , that shall torment all nations , when they hear of the love and favour that i will do to them , and when they hear of that glory and beauty that i will make to shine amongst them ; and when they hear of that privilege that i will give you , oh you Zion ! that you shall always rejoice , and sing , and shall dwell in peace , and he of one heart , and of one mind , glorying in me , and rejoicing in me , and blessing yourselves in my name ; and shall see nothing but joy for former things be passed away , and all things now become new , nothing but righteousness dwelling among you , and the glory of me the Lord of host overshadowing you , and keeping of you from sorrow and weeping ; having redeemed you out of the hands of them that were stronger than you , and have made you now stronger than all your enemies , and all shall lick the dust of the soles of thy feet , and call thee , the Zion of the Lord , the holy one of Israel ; and whereas thou hast been forsaken that no man went through thee ; i will make thee the glory and excellency of many generations even the joy and delight of the whole world : a place wherein there shall be nothing but singing and rejoicing in God ; even in me the Lord of host , who am the all of all things . 

And the Lord said within me , behold , & i looked & there appeared three suns ; and they were one above another ; the lowest was not so glorious as the middlemost , neither was the middlemost so glorious as the highest ; for the highest of them did outstrip the other in glory ; and did shine so gloriously , that it did darken and put out the light of both the rest ; for i did see that the middlemost had put out the light of the first , even so that it did scarce shine ; but the highest did so gloriously shine in such a bright manner , that the lesser lights were but darkness to that . And i said , Lord , what meaneth these suns , and one to be so bright over the other , and so to darken the rest ? and my God said , that these three suns hold forth three dispensations , one of them more glorious than the rest , and as they do appear unto you in glory , so did they shine for the time of their being ; and the first sun doth hold forth the first dispensation , even that , which was given by me the Lord of host to Moses , even that law that was written in tables of stone , and the children of Israel had amongst them ; therefore as i did appear to my servant Moses in such away as to give him a table of stone wherein was written all my statutes , laws and judgements , as i commanded my persons Israel to observe and keep , as the observing of the seventh day , and the offering of sacrifices , and the slaying of the pascall lamb , and the giving of them by tribes an inheritance , that they should not deal with other nations , as to make merchandise with them , were but all tips and figures of the appearing of my son Christ in flesh ; and so it was but a dark dispensation , in regard that it was but a dispensation that did hold forth Christ to come in the flesh ; and those that lived under it at that time until Christ had laws and commandments for to observe ; which they were never able to keep or fulfil ; so in this respect it did shine gloriously for the during or continuance of that time they were to continue ; because they my persons Israel , had laws and ordinances which all the nations besides them had not , and so God did not deal with other persons as he did deal with them ; as the psalmist says , God hath not dealt so with other nations as he hath dealt with us : that was in regard of my love and favour which i had to them as for to make choice of them at the first ▪ & so did take them as a peculiar persons from the nations , to whom i did commit my oracles : yet this was but a weak dispensation , because it could not give life to them that did keep them ; but those that were in the account of me the Lord of host , it was by looking to my promise ; even to Jesus Christ , which i did promise life by ; and so when the fullness of time came , that my son Jesus was to be made manifest in flesh , and was born , than the dispensation of types and figures ceased , and was not to be ; but was put out by the appearing of the second sun ; which was the second administration , even Christ a saviour coming in flesh amongst man , and so was by power declared to be the son of God ; herein even i the Lord of host did appear most gloriously to the persons in that age , by giving of my son Jesus and his disciple power to do and work miracles , which continue so long as my son was visible amongst them in flesh , and then it ceased as he ceased from being amongst them ; and this administration , was to continue for a time , as Moses were , for all the laws , and ways , and rules that are contained in this second administration , as given out by Jesus in the flesh as he were , was but to continue for a time ; which time was to last so long until all the kingdom shall be delivered up into the hand of the father , that he Might be all and in all ; that is at the end of this administration , i will take the power vuto myself that is i will make myself manifest in such an extraordinary way or manner , as will appear to the confounding or putting out all other lights besides myself ; as the third sun did appear very glorious to the rest , so will i in this administration of making out myself , or preaching myself in my sons and daughters , make my glory for to shine in a more extraordinary manner then before i did , for though i by my bright appearing in my sons and daughters , and in the world , at the time that my son was on the earth , did so powerfully operate in them , as that they must needs hold forth my image of love , for it is love that holds me forth more than any thing , and love it is that is the image of God , and i the god of gods did make them show love one unto the other , by making them give bread one to the other , as they did ; and so went from house to house and break bread together and had all things common , this was but a type of that great work which i will now do , as for to make not only my sons and daughters live in love and peace , and union , but also will make their enemies to be at peace with them , and will make them weary of their idol gods , as gold , and silver , and so will take from them that oppression that hath reigned from time to time ; and this i will do in my bright appearing in my sons and daughters , that shall see me to be their life and joy , and so to have nothing in worth or esteem besides myself , and so will make them to be the city or temple that shall have no need of men's light , or candlelight ; but i , even i their God , will be their light , and so will speak and preach in them peace and joy , and so will free them not only from looking after creature objects , but will wholly draw them up to live in me , and will make them to see that they are dead , and cannot eat or do any thing , but all their life is i the eternal God dwelling in them , and causing them to hear a word behind them saying , this is the way walk in it ; and so the new covenant shall be written in their hearts , they shall all know me from the least to the greatest , and they shall sin no more : at by my bright appearing or making out of myself to my persons , i will make them to know me , and all the rest shall know me , for i will be a terror and a dread to them , and so will make them to be afraid of me , and know me by my power that i will exercise over them , when my sons and daughters , even the new Jerusalem , shall see former things passed away , and all things become new ; all those things which formerly were sin to them , and did trouble them , to be no longer so , but new , and all sorrow to stay away : then it will and shall be to them that laugh and mock and revile my saints now , a fear and a dread , whereby they shall be in misery and in pain for doing so as they have done , for i will appear very glorious in my sons and daughters , i will destroy them all , even all their enemies , even within and without , so that they shall not sin , but shall be wholly seated in liberty and freedom , and shall do nothing but my pleasure , and i will joy in them , and they shall joy in me for evermore . 

So that in this third and last dispensation , God will appear so gloriously in his persons , that those that God is not well pleased for to make out himself in love unto , shall acknowledge that these are the sons and daughters of God , and so shall call us even the saints , the ministers of cod , and the priests of the Lord , such whom the Lord hath raised up to be restorers of the breaches , and making of paths for to dwell in ; for my work is now to make a separation for them , says the prophet ; then shall ye return and discern betwixt the godly and the wicked , for i the Lord of host in this last age will make a clear distinction , by manifesting my power , and by destroying all things besides myself ; so that i will make my saints to shine as stars in the firmament , by my bright appearing in them ; for i the day star , being risen in their hearts , will occasion all darkness to vanish away , and will make them shine so gloriously , by giving them a new name , which none shall know , but them that have it ; for i will make up my jewels in that day , and will make them to shine illustriously , that i will make the wicked acknowledge of a truth , that God , even the eternal God , dwells in them , and will now be worshipped in spirit and in truth , without forms , and rules , and ways , which hath already been : but by my teaching in them , i will make them to give up themselves to me ; and so to rejoice in me more than ever they have done as yet , i will fill them with my spirit , for i being of as great power as i was of old , so that they shall now see and know with cleverness , and speak as the spirit moves them , and talk as i act in them , even in such a sure way as my servants the prophets did of old , for my hands are not yet shortened , but can do such a work still as to make my saints no longer doubt and question what they say , but shall surely say the Lord speaketh thus , and so shall speak infallible once again , and not to doubt , as they do now , and have formerly ; for i will now open that mystery that hath been sealed up with seven seals , as a token of darkness , yea perfect darkness : which mystery will be opened now the seven last trumpets sound , and the last vial is now a pouring forth , which mystery is only God appearing to all in all ; and i the God , even the eternal King , taking my power myself , as to make all become subject to me , and not to forms , and so to make myself known that i dwell in men , and so will preach in men , and will cause other preaching which hath been in my offence to cease ; and i alone will preach and speak to men , and will tell them this is the way walk in it , when they turn to the right hand or to the left hand , when they are going astray from me , than i will speak to them for to make them come in the way which i would have them to walk in ; which if rightly considered , will make my sons and daughters greatly for to rejoice to see their god eye to eye , or to hear him speak in them , it will save abundance of trouble ; as it will make them leave off running after broken cisterns that can hold no water ; and also from running from mountain to hill , and so finding no resting place : oh saints here is a resting place for you , leave off gadding abroad , and running after other lovers , for i am your rest , and your dwelling , and be silent and sit still , and i will speak in you , yea even i will speak peace to you , and no good thing i will withhold from you ; and i will show you where i make my flock to rest and lie down at noon days , and where i lead them to the lively fountain of living waters : oh this place of rest , and place where i make my flock to rest , is for to bring them up in to me and then they shall find a Canaan , a rest indeed , and a river of living water , which shall never be dry , but always flowing forth with life and nourishing , joy and comfort to you that are thus brought up from all creatures , and so only wait for the speakings of me the Lord host in you , which i will surely do to the abundance satisfaction of your souls ; and you shall hear of it , and so shall lie down in •…est when others shall go about to seek rest by outward objects , and shall find none , or by looking after outward things , and none shall come . 

And i saw a vision wherein is showed that there shall be gathered out of this land a persons that shall go to Jerusalem , and also the Jews that are dispersed in all nations shall be gathered together , to go with them , and also a remnant of persons out of all lands , that shall go to Jerusalem ; that so the saying of the prophet Might be fulfilled , that all nations shall go and worship at Jerusalem , the vision is as followeth . 

There did appear a pair of scales , and within each seal a weight , one of them being a great deal bigger than the other , and it was to me like lead ; and the other being a little one , and like unto silver , was too light for the other for a while , and so the great one weighed it up , and held it for a while up ; but at length the scales turned , and the little weight weighed up the great weight ; and the great weight fell to the earth , and was no more . 

And i beheld that out of this little weight there came men and women , and i said , Lord , what meaneth this scale , and the hand that holds them up , and the weights in them ? and my god even the eternal King of glory said , the scales signify the earth , in whole the material frame of heaven and of earth , and the hand by which the scales were held , is shown my power by which i have erected them and so doth still hold them up from falling down , the weights signify two peoples , or two powers , the wicked and the godly , or the earthly powers , or my power ; by the great weight is set forth the earthly powers , and also wicked men , which have had powers and have ruled over my sons and daughters a great while , as was showed thee by weighing up the little weight ; and so have kept my persons in bondage and slavery to one thing or other , as to the rudiments of this world , and traditions of men ; but as the scale turned , it shows a turning of things upside down , and as the little weight weighed the great one up , for as much as by the little one is meant my sons and daughters ; and made the great one fall to the earth , and so to be no longer , is shown a destruction of those thieves that were , and that which were not , is now to come to pass ; as the powers of the earth and wicked men have ruled over my saints , the time is now come , they shall do so no longer , but must become subject to my persons ; for the kingdoms of the world shall i now give to my saints , and they shall possess them for ever , and all the might , and majesty , and glory , and strength of men , shall be nothing in my sight , for i will bring down the proud and haughty looks of men , and will lay them low , even to the dust , that they May no longer be ; for i will now stain all the pride and glory of man , and make man appear to be but dust and of no strength , that i the Lord of host May be exalted , and so become all the power and strength of men . 

And whereas thou didst see men & women come out of the little weight , & sprad themselves abroad , & as they went darkness vanished away and light increased much ; these persons are my sons and daughters , whom i will stir up to go to Jerusalem ; and out of this nation there shall go some , even the principal and chief leader of them shall be an English man , whom i have already chosen for to do the work of me : and also will i at this appearing stir up the Jews that are of the natural seed of Abraham , to go with him in their own country ; and i did see also that we that should go up should meet with many enemies , as Moses did when he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt , before they could get into Canaan ; but as God destroyed them all before Moses , and loshua and made way for his persons then ; even so will he now do the like , for he hath chosen one which he hath endued with power and courage ( Like Moses ) to be a leader , and God himself will fight our battles , so that all our enemies shall be made a prey to us in what country soever we pass through ; and when God shall be pleased for to bring us up to Jerusalem , than the Lord will make all the inhabitants to run away , and so the all of all things will give us houses that we builded not , for to dwell in , and orchards and vineyard : which we planted not , for to eat the fruit thereof : and also in this vision there was shown me one that was measuring a place , and it was to build a material temple , and the Lord said it should be built , and i did see it built , and it was like unto Paul's , and there we were to meet twice or thrice , and then it should be destroyed ; and of a sudden i see it destroyed and laid desolate , that we should no longer meet there in that material temple ; but should worship God even the eternal King of glory , in spirit ; and presently after this , i see all that were there , both men and women fall down to the ground as if they were dead ; but of a sudden i did see them all rise up , and so were as it were changed to a more glorious persons than they were before , and they should never die more ; and after this , there went a law out from amongst them into all nations and countries , for a law shall go out of Zion , and so these were shown me to be the bride , the lamb's spouse and wife , to whom all nations shall become subject , and shall not lift up hand or foot against them , for they shall be a terror to all the earth , and all the earth shall be afraid of them , and shall willingly let these that are afterwards a coming up , come up with ease and quietness , and help them forward in their way ; after this i see all tears were wiped from them , and they should sorrow and weep no more ; but all things are now to them become new , and everlasting joy and gladness of heart , singing and rejoicing in God ; God speaking in them , and teaching them , and being the light of them , both by day and night , so as all darkness shall vanish away , and all become light ; and so they shall all of them be of one heart and one mind ; and after i looked and beheld , and i could see nothing but pleasant orchards & gardens , full of fruit , and making a most pleasant smell , and all there food after this change was nothing but the fruit of the trees , and that they May have at any time , for as fast as one was pulled off , another appeared in the room presently , and so there was abundance of plenty , and joy , and pleasant music , and no more sorrow and sighing ; but all rejoicing , freed from sickness and pain , & living in the i enjoyment of eternity ; & the joy and glory of this happiness , the more i go to relate i• , i shall but darken it , and so i leave expressing any more . 

And again my eternal God said unto me , behold , what dost thou now see ? and lo i looked , and there appeared a woman all in white ; and presently after the woman , there appeared a man , and he took the woman and carried her round about the room ; and when he had brought her round , he brought her in the middle of the room , and set her upon a high place , even the highest in the room ; and i said , Lord , what doth this woman set forth unto me ? and the eternal God , even my father , the King of eternal glory , said , this woman doth represent my church , my spouse , my wife , even my peculiar and choice ones , whom i have brought up to see and know me , as i am the eternal being of all things , and how all things have their right being from me , who am the life all things , and for whom all things were made and create ; and as she was in white , it doth set forth , that i the eternal God have washed her from all her sins , and have taken her from all her foulness , and so have made her white , even so white , that she shall see and know now that all her sins and iniquities are pardoned and blotted out , and shall never come into my mind again , and so she shall know , even my wife , the spouse of my youth , even from all eternity , the peculiar and choice ones , and shall now sin no more , but shall be like me , even so as i am , so they shall be , when i have gathered them out from all their enemies , into the place where it is my pleasure for to bring them , even into Judea , for this is the place of my rest , and the place where i will cause my spouse , even my wife , for to rest ; and so to be free from all her enemies , and so shall live in peace , and in quietness , resting in me , and lying down in peace , being sure that i their King will preserve them from all their enemies . 

And this man which thou sawest take the woman and carry her round the room , sets forth me the Lord of host , who by my own power will do whatsoever i please with my spouse , my wife ; and so will be controlled by none ; but will do what i please for to do , and who are they that shall hinder me from doing of my pleasure ? and as thou sawest the woman carried round ; it shows forth me the Lord of host , who will by my own power go round , even the round world , and there will appear in all places of the world where my sons and daughters are , and so by my almightiness , even by my infinite strength , bring my sons from them ; and as thou sawest the man after he had brought the woman round , carry her still until he had brought her into the middle of the room , so will i by my own power , not only find them out , my sons and daughters the Jews only ; but i will also bring them by my power into Judea ; which is the middle of the world ; and as thou sawest the woman which doth represent my sons and daughters , set in the middle upon a hill ; even so will i by my own power bring my wife , which are the Jews , and gentiles , whom i have chosen , into Judea , and so will set them above all hills ; even upon the proud hill , and they shall rule over the proud hill-flesh , and fleshlyness , even over all the nations ; and all the greatness of the earth shall be as nothing in my sight in comparison of them , even my chosen ones , whom i have purposed for to bring out of the countries ; where now they be under their enemies , and so will free them from their oppressors ; and so they shall be by my mighty power , brought into a Canaan of rest : again i the eternal God , even the infinite Jehovah , by whom all things subsist and have a being , and i only am the life of all things ; therefore be ye not now as you was before in bondage to weak and beggarly elements , and so to be led about by the tradition and rudiments of this world , which shall perish and come to nothing ; but arise , and shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of i the Lord of host , is risen upon thee ; arise from all those foolish things , even from all things that you have lived in below me ; arise , i say , from out of the dust of the earth , and from that darkness which ye have formerly lain in , arise i say , from all death and sin , and from every thing that hath kept thee at a distance from me , and arise from all and every one of thy enemies , whom i have strike with fear and with terror , and whom i have made to be afraid , arise i say , even ye oh Jews , who are by nature the true olive branches , and once were broken off ; because of unbelief that the gentiles Might be grafted in ; arise , i say , from that unbelief , to believe on me ; yea , i say , thou shalt be grafted in again , notwithstanding the unbelief , and hardness of heart ; and though thou hast been as a woman grieved in spirit , and forsaken , having lost thy first husband , yet thou shalt now be found again , and instead of mourning and garments of sackcloth , i will clothe thee with joy and gladness of heart , and thou shalt mourn no more ; for the days of the mourning shall be at an end ; and instead of garments of sackcloth , i will adorn thee with ornaments and with jewels , even the best and chiefest among all the rich treasures that can be found thou shalt be adorned with ; for i do bid thee arise from all former troubles and sorrows whatsoever thou hast been subject unto , even from all manner of slavery ; as being servants and subject to the pleasures of Kings and other great men , yea from the Pope and Turk ; arise saith the Lord of host , for thy redeemer cometh , that shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob , even all those things that you in my absent have busied yourselves about , shall now be destroyed ; and all , yea whatsoever it is , must now by my bright appearing be brought to nothing and confounded , that i the Lord of host May be all things ; therefore arise from death , yea every thing that you have been acted in ; arise from them , for the time of the resurrection is now come , that you shall be raised from a condition of sorrow , and trouble , and slavery , and death itself , into a condition of joy and gladness of heart , and of life itself ; whereas formerly you have been at the command of men , and so they have had their wills of you , it shall no longer be so with you now in this day of the resurrection : but on the contrary , you shall instead of being their servants , and at their commands , become Lords over them , and they shall withal their treasures , come bowing and bending unto you , such is the alteration that i will now make here on earth , to redeem you out of the hands of your cruel enemies , and to bring you into my promised land , the place where formerly i did make out my glory and my name to your fathers of old , which was the persons whom i did choose out of all nations ; and so did bring them into that land where i did make my power and my name known , which was but a type of that glory which i will now make known unto you & to my chosen servants the gentiles ; whom i will bring with you into this place where i the Lord of host doth intend to hold forth my glory in a more powerful manner then ever i have done as yet ; and in a far more glorious manifestation of myself then ever i have done as yet ; even in so clear a discovery of myself to you , whom i will bring up into the place of my glory , and the place where i will make myself known ; and as formerly all were subject to my servant David , who was King of the Jews , even so shall all persons be subject to you , whom i have appointed to bring into Judea , for this is your resurrection ; i will now raise you from all sorrow and trouble , and so will set you free from all your enemies ; and will make you the praise of the whole earth , and all the nations shall see and know that i have chosen Judea to be the place of my rest , where i will make my stocks to lie down at noon days , even in the heat of the misery of the nation will i make the Jews and the gentiles whom i will bring up by my mighty power shall lie down and be at rest and so be in quietness and so will cause the work of righteousness to increase , and it shall take effect , and the fwork of righteousness shall be quietness and assurance for ever for or my persons , even for you o lews and gentiles whom i will bring up into Judea , and my persons shall dwell in peaceable and quiet habitations , even in such peace and quietness after this first resurrection , that all your enemies shall be destroyed from you , and shall not be suffered to come to you or against you by no means , for there shall not be a Canaanite in my house , even in this city Jerusalem , or in the limits of your abode , but i the Lord of host will destroy them all , that you May be at rest , and so enjoy me without any let or hindrance at all , for will i graft thee into the vine again ; and so will raise thee up to thy former condition ; even to be my peculiar and choice ones , to whom i will make out myself in a glorious dispensation and manifestation of my love and favour once again ; so that i will make all thy sorrows to be forgotten , by reason of so glorious an enjoyment of me , who am the alpha and Omega , and hath now raised you up from from the dead , and from a condition of darkness into light . 

arise , and not only arise but shine , make it appear by your condition , that you are not only risen from the dead , but you have also light come into you ; therefore shine , and be not so dark as you have been , when you were dead , and in your enemy's hands , no , but be on the contrary ; shine , hold forth the glory of me your creator and redeemer , who have ransomed you from the hands of them that were stronger than you , shine , and let my glory be seen upon you , for they shall be afraid of you that hate you ; shine , ye therefore , and be like so many stars that shines in the firmament , and glister like so many as the only persons that are redeemed from death to light : for thy light is come , i am your life and light , and by being absent from you , your condition was a condition of death and darkness , and you were compassed about with abundance of sorrow , by being scattered abroad in the world ; but i who am your life and light , even i the mighty God of Jacob , am now risen to bring you into your own country , even together , ö daughter of Zion , shout and rejoice , and cry aloud , sing and make merry , and be glad in your King , who am now risen with mighty power , for to bring you into your own land ; therefore rejoice and sing , for thy light is come & Zion that was scattered abroad ; but now shall be gathered into your own country , even into Judea : for the glory of the Lord is risen upon you , even my glory is risen upon thee , for to bring thee out of a strange country ; and as pilgrims and sojourners into your country , there for to make my glory and light shine and rest upon thee : for the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee , even upon thee ö captive daughter of Zion : for to make you see and know that i have purposed to bring you into your own country once again , and there to make thee the praise of the whole earth and the earth to see and know my power by which i do things , saith i the Lord of host ; who hath caused my glory for to arise upon thee ; for you have now a more surer word of prophecy , to which you do well to take heed , as to a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts : this was given to the church in that age , who was to observe the word of the apostles then and at that time , they being but babes and children , & so had a rule for to walk by , which rule the apostle bids them take heed unto , that they walk by it : for how long ? even saith the same apostle , until the day break , until there be some further appearance of light , a more glorious dispensation then now is , and the day star in your hearts , that is until you do see & know God dwelling in you , and so do see & know Christ , who is the bright and morning star : to be one with the father , son , & holy ghost : but one God dwelling in you , who is your life and strength , and so to see this god in love , to be your all and in all , and the very life of all things : till than you being weak , have had need of a written rule to walk by , but now you have no longer need of any thing to walk by , no not the scripture to walk by ; for i even your King and Lord , will be unto you scripture , and law , and rule , and ways , and forms of worships , yea i will be all : arise and shine , for thy light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee , even my glory shall now shine upon thee , for to make thee the praise of the whole earth , and the joy of all the nations , arise and shine , for behold darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the persons ; arise , shine , your condition will and shall be happy , saith i the Lord of host , who hath made my glory to shine upon you , even upon you ö Zion ; whom i will gather into Judea from amongst other persons : but i will tell you one thing , even you whom i do gather up into Judea : for behold this , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the persons : even when you shall see light , and walk in light , and have light to be your guide , and have my glory shining upon you , even than shall others , the earth , be covered with darkness , for there shall be no clear light , and sun shining upon the earth , even upon those that come not up to worship me the Lord of host in Jerusalem , but instead of light , there shall be darkness , and instead of breaking forth of light , there shall be a mist and a cloud that shall overspread itself for a while , so that they that go not up to Jerusalem shall not have that clear light , neither shall they see and know that glory which i will and shall make out to you ö Zion : for you ö Zion shall eat , and drink , and be full , and have the bread of life , and water of life , when they that come not up shall be in want , and shall be hungry , when Zion shall be full ; for i will take away all their food , even their forms and ways of worship , and will utterly destroy them and bring them to nothing ; for these things , as forms of worship have they had some comfort in using them ; but i will leave these dispensations wherein i have formerly appeared , and will make darkness cover the earth in this sense , for i will deprive them of all their forms and church governments ; for i will forsake them , and they shall receive no benefit by them , even darkness shall cover them , that they shall not see light in them , even gross darkness , even such a darkness will and shall light upon poor creatures that walk by forms , and so think to be carried to heaven upon the shoulders of their priests ; but darkness , yea such darkness that both priest and persons shall be amazed ; for they shall be driven out of their common-road , and so shall be forced to seek a new way , even this darkness shall light upon those that are malicious and full of envy , and so would of a sudden destroy their fellow creatures ; darkness will and shall overcome such ; for though they preach and pray , yet all will not save them , but that they must be destroyed and brought to nothing ; for saith the Lord of host darkness shall cover the earth : there will be no clear sight of God , and no clear sight of my way : for they shall not come to my knowledge , and so to the enjoyment of me here or in any place , but where Zion shall be gathered together , even my persons , whom i have raised from the dead , and so will bring them up to Zion , at Jerusalem the city where formerly i dwelled , which is in Judea , and there i will make them shine , and be the glory of the whole earth : and after this first resurrection that they shall have for to be raised from a condition of death and slavery , into a condition of joy and life , where the second death shall have no power over them : for this is the resurrection wherein i will set you free from all death : and you shall die no more , for i will be your life , and you shall live for evermore , for now shall appear the sign of the son of man coming in the air : which sign of my coming , is now , forasmuch as i the Lord of host , doth begin to declare unto my servants what i do now intend to do : for this air where it is said , then shall appear the sign of the son of man , is not meant only the air above , but rather that air which is in this earth of yours ; for as your bodies are earthy , so are they airy , for they , even your bodies , are not compounded only of earth , but of air , and so i appearing in your bodies , and so making choice of instruments for to do my work , and my strange work , that is my sign , or the sign of the son of man coming in the air : which sign is for to give persons warning of what i intend to do , that so if i find them not doing what i would have them to do , they May the better be judged by me : and so punished for not doing of what i would have them do , for the appearing of my sign , is to declare unto them that i am coming to judge and destroy all things in man , especially in my saints , besides myself , and so to raise my son up from that grave and place of imprisonment , as now for the present lies in : even to restore her to life , that she May die no more : for blessed are they that have part in the first resurrection , on whom the second death shall have no power : it is a most joyful saying to them that have themselves raised up to be brought into such a place where they shall die no more : which will be at the place where i have appointed to make myself glorious ; and so will appear in my glory , and so make my power known , by being a god of power , who have raised up Zion from amongst their enemies , and have brought her into her own land , even into a place where she my wife and i must be married , and so they shall live for ever , and never die no more , for my Zion shall be changed , & so shall become new ; for the old man which for the present they carry about them , shall be destroyed , and the new man Christ shall come forth ; and so they shall live for ever , and never die more ; and so after this they shall be as the angels of God , as my son Christ said , that should neither marry or be given in marriage but shall live in the full enjoyment of me , who am the Lord of host , that lives for evermore , for when they are brought into the full and perfect enjoyment of me , and be at peace with themselves , so as they shall never marry or give themselves in marriage , according to the customs of us , now these customs shall wholly be destroyed , and a new one shall come in , that they shall live in pure and perfect enjoyment of me their creator , and so shall have the use of those whom i appoint together , and so shall have the use of one another . 

For the angels that neither marry or give themselves in marriage , are not any create substances besides man , as to be in a place above the skies , keeping of me company in one place : yea though it is true , the angels , the good angels as you call them , that left not their first estate , do keep me company , and are where i am , and where i be there they be . 

For these angels made mention of , and also them made mention of in Peter , that left their first estate , and so are reserved in chains of darkness unto the great day : are no other angels then what is in man . For i the Lord of host made man purely good , and before he fell , he was holy , just , and upright , being a pure angel of mine , and so one that should never die if he had continue in the condition as he was set in : but it was the pleasure of i the creator to set him in such a condition as i knew well enough he should fall : for had it been the pleasure of i the Lord he should have stood and so have lived for ever ; for if he had stood and lived for ever , then should not my power have been seen so much as it is now : for this Adam was made good and just ; and all things in him , and all things besides him were good and not evil : but yet notwithstanding out of this Adam who was made good and just , did proceed a serpent for to beguile Eve the weaker vessel , and this serpent was not a serpent , a creature that poisons , and so lives as a creature , no , but this serpent was within Eve and Adam , and so was something from Adam degenerated from its institution , from what it should be , to what it should not be ; and that is this , as Adam was made good , and no evil was to be seen in him , as i the Lord of host hath declared at the first : but that i the Lord gave him reason , and knowledge , and wisdom , which in themselves were very good : for by these things he did differ from the beasts , and from every living creature ; and by these things , as reason , knowledge , and wisdom , did he give unto every creature which i the Lord God had made , and also did he know the nature of every green herb , and of every thing , as to give them a name . 

Thus was Adam in his first estate good , furnished with every thing , and so did live in paradise , even in God , and so had the pure and perfect enjoyment of the creator that made him ; but it did please me for to let him alone , and Eve especially , being the weaker vessel and not able to contain herself in that condition , as to know much and do little : but she did put herself forward in a way for to eat the apple that she was commanded to let alone , for she had so much reason , wisdom , and knowledge , as that she knew well enough that if she did eat of the fruit she should have been as God ; and this the serpent , who being a more subtle creature than any of the beasts of the field was , did urge Eve for to eat of the fruit : which serpent was no other but that reason , wisdom , and knowledge , which is the spirit of men , and women , and is in man very good of itself , if man had but power for to keep it under , from going about to do that it should not do ; and this was the only serpent that made Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit : even that reason , knowledge , and wisdom that was in her , for that reason , and knowledge , & wisdom , that was in her , did degenerate from what it should do , and did do what it should not : the degenerating from what it should do , was its pride , by doing what it should not do : as it was given her for to know how she should keep & perform that she had a command for to do . It was good in its self , but instead of keeping , she breaks the command , & that by being beguiled by the serpent ; which is no other but her own reason , wisdom , & knowledge , as her God had given her , even i the creator : & so this reason , wisdom , & knowledge , which was a good angel , & the angels of God in Adam & Eve , by knowing more than they should have done , and so by presuming to go higher , even to be as God , like me their creator , this reason , knowledge , and wisdom , which was good and the good angels of God , even i the creator of all things did for presumption , turn it from what it was , even from a good angel or spirit in man , into a serpent , a wicked angel , an opposer of i their creator ; and so i did cast this wicked angel , even this wicked reason , knowledge , and wisdom , which became wicked , for presuming to go higher than it should have done , and so for this end and purpose did i the creator cast out this reason , wisdom , and knowledge , for opposing me in Eve , and in Adam , to be kept in chains and in bonds of darkness , until the day of judgement , which chains and bonds of darkness , is no other but giving it up to its own course , and so to let it run its own race in running from me , and then giving it ever now and then a touch of my power and glory , which i do cause them to behold in whom this serpent doth remain , and so doth cause it to receive torment from me , for not making out myself unto them . 

And so these angels good and had are both in man ; the good . Angels are the spirits of just men , that give themselves up to God , and so their reason , knowledge , and wisdom , which is the spirit of man , are the good angels of God , that are called ministering spirits : & these angels are always God's companions , and so do keep God , even i the all of all things company , and are always with me , and in me , i being their rest and place of ease : for when any of my saints return from the earth , so that the body becomes to be dust again , then do i draw up the soul and its spirit to their centres , whose centres is i the Lord of host , who am the life of all men : and their life is their soul , which must return to me again , i being its fountain ; and as for the spirit that returns to me when it leaves the body of a saint ; for i am unto them reason , wisdom , and knowledge , and so their spirit in them answers to mine ; which because it becomes subject to me , it is an angel of light , and also are angels and ministering spirits , whom i the Lord of host sends out to minister comfort to my persons ; and sometimes in forms and in shapes as i please ; and sometimes by making their spirits answerable to mine , and so make them rest in me ; whence as the body now lies in the grave , for saith the apostle , are not angels ministering spirits , set out to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation ? sent out to them whom i will please to send them to : so than the good angels , are the spirits of just men made perfect ; and so saith the apostle , we are come to an innumerable company of angels , even to the spirits of just men made perfect , here you May see by your scriptures that angels are but the spirits of just men , for just men made perfect are angels ; ceasing from labour and sorrow , for to rest in me the all of all things , who am the life of all things ; and so the angels in scripture made mention of , are but the spirits of just men whom i can make to appear in the form of a man , and what in power , or otherwise in what shape or form i please , and so good angels are but the spirits of just men , even of my saints which are deceased , or now contiving and abiding in me the Lord of host . 

The bad angels that fell and are reserved in chains of darkness unto the judgement day of the Lord of host , is the serpent that is in man , and is the wisdom , and reason , and knowledge , that is in man , which is the spirit of man ; and this reason , wisdom , and knowledge , which was made good , for all things were good , and so there were no evil , this for becoming to exalt itself , as to know more than i was willing to let it know , did cast itself under my wrath , & so became a curse , under which curse it still lies , and so will remain unto the judgement day : for this reason , and wisdom that is in man exalting itself against God , and not becoming subject to God , is the serpent that beguiled Eve , and so it did Adam , and so doth and will do until it be taken away : and for beguiling Eve it became a serpent , and a wicked angel thrown out of heaven , that is , out of the love and favour of i the Lord of host , into darkness , that is , into my sore displeasure : and not only a wicked angel , but a devil , and so all wicked spirits are devils : for there were nothing create evil , but all was made good ; and this reason in man was good if it had but kept his bounds wherein i had set it , but by taking liberty to do what i would not have it do , it became at enmity with me , and so became a devil and a destroyer , and so a murderer ; a destroyer and murderer in that it forsook me the fountain of life , where it Might have had rest , and so have been at quiet , and so hath destroyed itself and hath made itself the very curse , and so is become the most odious and greatest enemy to mankind , puffing itself up , and will not willingly be subject to i the Lord of host : though it is true i could make it become subject to me if so be i would show my infinite power for to bring it from the curse , even than would reason , wisdom , and knowledge , which is the spirit of man , and so consequently , the devil if it opposes God : become the greatest joy and comfort to man : for the devil is evil in itself , not made a devil , but he became a devil by disobedience , it being the good pleasure of i the Lord that it should be so , and so then the spirits of wicked men and women are witches and devils : for as you read of men that were possessed with devils ; and as you read that Christ did cast out devils : these devils are nothing but the spirits of wicked men deceased ; which as soon as they go out of the body they are not at rest , neither can they rest or be at quiet , but they are always seeking about in whom they May enter ; yea though it be my pleasure for to keep them out of all , yet i do not , but do let them get into some , and there he becomes a worse devil than he were before , and so doth remain for the time of the bodies being ; and after that ceases , it goeth into another ; and these are witches , even the spirits of wicked men are witches , and i make use of them as my instruments to punish and plague other wicked men in whom the same spirit remains : and i do also allow unto these witch's power for to torment , as to bewitch the cattle of men , for they in bewitching of them they die ; for it is my pleasure to suffer this for a while : and these witches are the devil and serpent mentioned ; and the devil that Christ cast forth which run into the heard of swine , was no other spirit or devil but the spirit and devil of a wicked man deceased : its going into the heard of swine by asking Christ leave , shows that it cannot go into any it self or what it doth , it doth it by having permission from me to do it , and so nothing is done but i must give way for it to be done , as i gave way for the devil that was cast out , to go into the herd of swine ; which swine sets forth wicked men , for nothing is more like to a wicked man then a swine , for as a wicked man will drink and be drunk , so will a swine swill till he bursts himself , if he Might be put to some ale or strong beer ; so that the devil being cast out of a wicked man , and the man become a convert , there is no place for him to be any longer , but the devil begging to go into the herd of swine , shows his earnest desire to be in his element ; for the swine sets forth wicked men , and so the devil that was cast forth went into the wicked men , even into its centre from whence it came . 

For the very rise of this devil , and also of wicked spirits which are devils , was not made by God , even by i the Lord of host , to be so , but they departing from good , and made the good which i gave them evil , and so they became devils , declining from doing that which i commanded them to do ; and so the very rise and fountain from whence the devil came , was from man , his imaginations being continually evil , though man could never do so much as to do any thing contrary to me , but must of necessity do my pleasure ; for i only am active , and the creature only and alone passive ; so that devil that doth most torment men is God , who doth give power unto wicked spirits for to punish them , and wicked spirits do nothing but what is the pleasure of i their King , who suffers them to do as they do , while the time runs round , and comes to the same being and form as it was at the first . 

for the seed of the woman shall break the serpent's head ; this woman is the church , and so the seed is Christ in this church ; so than the Christ which is the new man , shall in time rise and break in pieces the old man , old Adam shall be destroyed and consumed to nothing , the serpent whose head must be broke , is that reason , knowledge , and wisdom , even that serpent and devil that came in by disobedience , and must be destroyed , and so cast into the lake of fire ; for the day of judgement unto which this devil is reserved and kept in chains of darkness , is the day of my power , by which power i will destroy and bring to nothing this devil , for the day of judgement when i will judge this devil , it will be my bright appearing to confound the adversary , and so to bring to nothing all the serpentine wisdom of the flesh ; and also all the cunning and craftiness of the proud flesh ; for the chains in which this serpent is reserved , is nothing else , but that i do out give unto all that power and strength to come into its first station where in it was set , which in time i will destroy all besides these things , that shall appear gloriously and shine by holding forth my glory , and will make Christ the new man , appear in power , spreading of itself in all , for to redeem all from this power of darkness , and will make man to be as he was at the first , taking away the devil & wicked spirits from man , yea out of man , and that which was made good and become a devil , shall once again become good , and so become an angel of light , for myself spreading in my sons and daughters in my chosen and peculiar ones at Jerusalem first , whither i will gather my Zion together , and that power that spreads in them shall in time spread itself , and never leave spreading until it hath redeemed the earth from the curse , & so hath redeemed man from being any more subject to the serpent , and so will never leave spreading its self , until it brings all into its self from whence all came , and so shall all once again return , even into the same condition as Adam was in ; for all to be as one , and all speak one language ; for as at the building of Babel all were confounded in their languages , even so at the destruction of Babel shall all be brought to speak one language , which will be in revolution of all things , when the time , even that time shall be at an end , then will there be a redemption from all bondage , not some only , but all , yea the whole creation shall then be wholly set free into the glorious liberties of the sons of God ; all creatures shall then have benefit by Christ , yea the very poor beasts ; for all things shall become as they were in Adam's days before he fell , even in the year when i the Lord even i the mighty God of Jacob will judge and destroy all that enmity that hath been betwixt the creature , and so all that enmity that hath been betwixt one creature and another , and all shall be set free even into liberty once again ; so that i will make all men to be changed , and will take away that malicious spirit that now is and remains amongst men ; and i , even i will bring all things round , and so will make my son Christ to be a great redeemer , and he shall redeem all that did fall in Adam , from death and misery , into the same condition as Adam was in at the first , even to set all in purity , and so to make all live in God ; and so shall all Israel be saved , and all ungodliness shall be turned away ; for it is my pleasure for to take pity on the works of my hand , & not to continue in wrath against my poor creatures , who are not able to do any thing without me , and so the time of the restitution of all things to the same as they were in Adam before he fell , shall clearly be manifested after 7000 years be accomplished and brought to an end , but while then , the creature man shall not be wholly set free from the curse that is from serpentine wisdom , and from being troubled and perplexed , because i the Lord of host doth not shine upon them . 

For darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the persons , this darkness that shall cover the earth will be by reason it is my pleasure to forgo all forms and dispensations , and all outward worships whatsoever , and so wholly to give the outward court to be trodden under foot , even all forms & rules , and worships , and governments of men which they have set up , to be consumed and destroyed , and brought to nothing , and so i alone to be all & in all ; when i doth this , it shall surely come to pass , even than shall the poor creatures be in darkness and not able to see light , by reason of my withdrawing myself to my own place and dispensation , even into my Judea , there for to make my light shine , & there to appear gloriously in and amongst my saints , whom all shall acknowledge that they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed ; therefore my drawing myself into this peculiar place for to make myself glorious , and so to make my name in far greater esteem by all sorts of men then now it is , i will make my light shine in a far more greater and glorious manner then now it doth , for i will be the praise of the whole earth , i dwelling in my persons , and my persons dwelling in me , and i will measure the inward court , even my temple , wherein all flesh and fleshlyness shall cease and be no more , and i alone will appear to be King , and the only ruler , and so will cause my light to shine upon them , when darkness shall cover the earth , which darkness and gross darkness shall be by reason of my not shining in the world ; for all persons shall be left in darkness and not in light that come not up to the place of rest ; where i will cause my persons for to lie down in peace , and so to be at rest , and so to be quiet , and be in peace . 

When nothing but sorrow and pricks of conscience shall accompany those that go not up to Jerusalem , for that must be built in glory again , & set on her foundation , & so this manifestation of God not appearing to the creature , shall be hell & the lake of fire , wherein the wicked and all witches must be tormented , and •his hell will be in every place where i do not appear in love to the creature for wherein i do appear in love there shall be , joy , & peace , & no sorrow ; and where i do not appear in love , there shall be nothing but hell ; for hell shall be in this world , even in these bodies shall men be tormented ; even by being cast out and not suffered to enter into the city , where nothing but peace shall be , but dogs and sorcerers shall be without , even they shall be in hell until the restitution of all things come , that there shall be no more devil nor hell , which will be ( For all , the devil , and hell , and all witches shall cease then , even ) in the year 7000. for that shall be a year of jubilee to all sorts of persons , when all sorts than shall be brought into my love and favour , and shall so remain ; and they shall die , even men shall die as formerly they used to do , that go not up to Jerusalem , even they shall die and be subject to change , until the time comes that they shall die no more ; but my persons shall hear the sound of the archangel , and they being dead in Christ , shall be raised up to meet the Lord in the air , even from that death they are for the present subject to , and so shall even in a moment at the founding of the last trumpet be changed , in a moment , even in the twinkling of an eye , and so shall be raised up from death into life , and from sorrow unto joy , and happiness , and so shall be ever with the Lord of host , and so shall die no more , but live for ever , and all the saints shall come with i the Lord of host , even to be glorified , and so to receive what bodies it shall please i their King to give them there ; for it is true that my sons and daughters shall be brought to be glorified , and shall have bodies given them , though not the same bodies of clay as formerly they had , even they shall beraised up to live & reign for evermore ; even my saints as the saints formerly were raised out of the graves and walked up and down , so shall my saints be now raised up to be at Jerusalem in glory , for the Jerusalem is the place which i have chosen for to make my name glorious , and the place of my saints heaven : for though persons talk of heaven above , there is none : heaven above is myself drawing my saints into my fullness , than i bring them into my third heaven , which is my highest dispensation , and the highest discovery of my love to them : and this heaven shall be here on earth , even at Jerusalem , and the place about Jerusalem , where i will appoint my sons and daughters to be ; and this shall be their heaven they shall live in the full enjoyment of i the Lord almighty , and they shall see all former things to be passed away , and all things become new ; and they shall live in pure love , and in the full enjoyment , of i the Lord of host , who hath made them holy whom i will always cause to rejoice , and sing , and leap for joy of heart , because former troubles are passed away , and all are now become new , and all things shall be new ; for the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints , and the . Lord will reign in mount Zion for evermore : even i the mighty God of Jacob will reign for ever over my persons , and over my enemies , and all shall become subject to me . 

But the Lord shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee , when nothing but darkness shall be in the earth and in the outward court : though there be nothing else in the earth , but darkness , such darkness as men ( Earthly men ) shall have no comfort at all in all their outward forms and ways of worships ; which is the outward court , and is not to be measured at all , but is to be left to be trodden under foot , as that which shall come to nothing , and as a thing of no account , by aliens and gentiles , even by such as know not me the Lord . But as for my sons and daughters whom i have made choice of , & so will bring them into Judea , there to make my glory to be seen amongst them : then shall they see that i am risen upon them , and so consequently , they are the inward court which is to be measured , and so to be made much of : even that new man Christ the anointed that is in them , shall increase and grow so strong in every kind or degree , that their old man Adam shall be destroyed and quite brought to nothing : and then in these ( I mean the Jews and gentiles ) which shall be gathered into Judea the land of promise , where my glory shall be seen and made to appear to all the world , and the partakers of this great glory , shall be the inward court that shall be measurable and made glorious ; and the inward shall increase more and more , and so it shall at length break forth in such a glorious splendour , and in such a clear and bright manner as never hath been as yet , which inward court shall be taught by myself , and so shall have the enjoyment of myself , when all flesh , and fleshly actings shall be destroyed and brought to nothing ; and so shall this new man which is spiritual be wholly freed from the curse , and shall never have the like power again for to come under the curse , even under that curse which Adam brought into or upon the world , as to die and so to be subject to death or dying , but shall be wholly freed from the curse , and so shall be restored into the same condition again as Adam was in before his fall , and so shall have no power any more to come under the curse ; but i their God will so guide them by my eternal glory , which shall shine upon them , even upon the new man , which shall make all the old man cease from being , and so this new man shall be in a more glorious manner discovered to be , even this new man shall spring forth as to be altogether righteous , even the innocency and right cousness that was in Adam at the first , when he was commanded not to eat the forbidden fruit : which fruit was nothing else than that he should not seek to be higher than i had set him to be , & so should not break my words but fulfil them , which i knew well enough he would break them and not fulfil them , by his longing desire after the fruit which i had commanded him he should not eat of , that is , he should not have any desire to know more than i had given him , but he should have rested himself in that condition which i had placed him in , and then had not he eaten of the forbidden fruit , and so had not done any thing for to displease . It is true i was displeased with him to his apprehensions , because i did curse the serpent , which serpent was that reason , knowledge and wisdom , which i had given him for to glorify me , and so by cursing of that , it became a devil and so is my greatest enemy that now i have in paradise , even in my own peculiar persons , to whom i have made out my glory most too , for the garden of paradise is man , wherein were nothing but glory , or wherein i had made myself to man to tarry , even in Adam , and so would not have had him suffered at all , or knew any sorrow at all , had not he have been so inquisitive for to have known more than i would let him at the first . And when he had eaten of the fruit , it is said he walked in the garden and was naked : that is , knew well enough that he had disobeyed me , and so in that sense he was naked , as being stripped of my glory , and of that enjoyment of me which formerly he had ; even so that he could not have that free commerce or enjoyment of me as formerly he had , as to talk with me ; and he being naked , and had covered himself with sigg leaves , that he had sowed together ; was nothing but his own righteousness ; by which he would fain have hide his fault from me , and so would have made Eve have lain in all the fault : and so ever since man being driven out of the garden as Adam was ; which was from the full and perfect enjoyment of i their Lord : and so from having no more sweet and pleasant mirth with me , as Adam had at the first ; have been inventing and sowing sigg leaves together , that is , they have been justifying themselves in their ways , and so will not be ready to confess their faults , but to lay it to another , as Adam did his : and Adam being put out of the garden , there was set a flaming sword that turneth every way , for to keep Adam from the tree of life , that so poor Adam Might not eat again and live for ever : for this flaming sword that did turn every way , was my power , my infinite power , for to keep Adam from the full enjoyment of me , and so from the tree of life : for i had withdrawn myself , even my power from Adam , and so would not let him have that power again , but would keep him from the tree of life ; even from the pure enjoyment of me , and so from life which i had promised him , that he should have lived for ever : which privilege he lost by disobedience , and by falling from me , and so hath never since obtained the same privilege ; but all have lain under the curse for to die : which privilege i the restoring power will now restore to my saints first , even to those whom i will carry out of Babylon , both out of mystical Babylon , which is the very mystery of iniqity : and out of literal Babylon , by my strong hand into Judea , and so to Jerusalem the place where i will make myself more glorious then as yet since the fall of Adam ; and so will restore to my saints there , that privilege as Adam lost and hath not as yet been obtained , but now shall be obtained , which privilege shall be a full and perfect enjoyment of i the creator of all creatures , and so to be freed from the curse which is from self , reason , knowledge , and wisdom , that is , they shall no longer have that reason , knowledge , and wisdom , which i did give to every Adam , and so to every man going beyond the bounds , but they shall by my power stand in the full enjoyment of me , as Adam did at the first ; and so they shall never have power any more ( As Adam had ) for to fall from the pure and perfect enjoyment of i their creator , as Adam did ; but shall be restored into the same condition as Adam was at the first , even into that condition as for to live for ever , even to all eternity , and so never to die any more , as Adam did by his fall , but shall be wholly freed from the curse ; as from all kind of sicknesses and sorrows which came into the world by reason of the curse which i pronounced against Adam for breaking of my revealed will : which condition they being restored into , there cannot choose but be abundance of joy , which joy will light upon my chosen ones , whom i will gather to Jerusalem , and joy and gladness shall be there : even to my Zion that shall be gathered together at Jerusalem , whom i will make the praise of the whole earth , foreby light is come , and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee ; even upon thee , oh Zion , and thou shalt be established in glory , but the Lord shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen on thee , and thou shalt be made the praise of the whole earth ; and the gentiles shall come to thy light , and Kings to the brightness of thy rising , even unto thy light , oh ye Jews , whom i will gather out of all the countries wherein ye have been dispersed , even they shall come to see that light that i will make known unto you when i shall have brought you out of captivity and bondage into the place of rest , or to that place which i will make to be the resting place ; for thy light shall increase , and grow bigger and bigger , when all other lights shall be put out ; for i am the light , even i the Lord of host , who will make you to shine most illubriously and gloriously ; even so bright , that the gentiles , even my chosen ones ( Whom i have made much of my glory out unto ) they shall see and know that your light doth not shine there , because it is my pleasure for to make my light shine upon you , even upon the Jews who ( through unbelief ) were broken off ; and gentiles were grafted in ; but now i will appear unto them , and will give them hearts to believe on my name , and so will make them the desires of all nations : even all nations shall long and desire for to come to thy light ; because my glory shall be seen upon thee , when i have forsaken all other administrations besides this of mine , which i will make more illustriously to shine , even to draw up my sons and daughters into spiritual communion with myself , and so they shall worship me in spirit and in truth : and Kings shall come in , even great men of the gentiles shall be with you , for Kings shall come to the brightness of thy rising : even when thou hast risen from that death which thou art for the present subject to ; so that thy brightness shall appear in a more extraordinary manner then now it doth , even than shall Kings be brought to see thy rising , and to behold thy glory by my bright appearing and manifesting my glory unto you ; then shall thy glory far surpass all the glory and beauty of the world besides ; and none shall be like to thee for beauty and comeliness ; for i will make thee to shine so gloriously , that thou shalt dazzle the eyes of all the earth , and all the earth shall stand and be amazed at thee , for the Kings that shall come to thee , shall be such whom i have or shall crown with my love and favour , and so my love shall cause them to come to the brightness of thy rising , even thine , oh Jews , who are by nature descended from Abraham , and so are Hebrews , and are and shall be made the praise and glory of all nations ; for these Kings shall see no light and comfort besides i the Lord of host , and therefore shall they be brought to thy rising and shall see i the Lord of host in a more especial manner appear to you in Jerusalem , whom i will cause to be inhabited , and made the praise of the whole earth , in such glory as they shall not be able to tarry behind , but shall come to the brightness of thy rising ▪ even when the nations of the earth shall see that i the Lord of host hath raised thee up from that poor estate and condition that thou art now in ; even from death and slavery ; and so from darkness into a most glorious condition •nd so to make thee shine most bright and clear , oh Zion , and daughter of Jerusalem , that was a poor and peeled remnant , scattered abroad in all the world evenwhen i thy God shall raise thee up from this condition , & make my glory to be seen upon thee , then shalt thou be enquired after , even by Kings and great men , who shall stand amazed at thy glory and honour where with i will honour thee in this thy day from the resurrection from the dead , which i will raise thee nito a condition of life and peace , which shall be the first resurrection from the dead ; and so no more darkness , or any longer shall Satan or death have power over thee , but thou being raised from the dead , shall now live and reign with me a thousand years ; which thousand years shall be for ever , even to eternity , and Satan shall never have any power over thee , oh Zion , the praise of the whole earth ; but thou shall sing and rejoice , and shall go with singing and rejoicing ; when others shall be thrown into hell , even to be deprived of my love and favour which i will show unto thee , oh daughter of Zion ; who• i will gather into the land of Judea , and without shall be those that shall apprehend me to be angry with them , and so their own consciences witnessing against them , and accusing of them will condemn them , for their unbelief and hardness of heart , and so their hell shall be by being pricked in their own consciences , that they have offended me , and so shall suffer by the reason they condemn themselves , and so shall be in hell , because they shall not have any joy or comfort from me to them ; that i am a god of love to them ; and even this portion shall those drink of that styles themselves to be ministers , and are sent to preach by me the Lord of host , and they know not me , neither can they by all their human wisdom or philosophy attain to the mystery which i will make out unto them whom i shall be pleased for to do , even for to make out my power and name , and so to cause them to see my glory ; which i will hide from the learned ones of the world , and will make choice of the unlearned ; and so will make them to run when i send them to do my message , even as i stirred up poor herdsmen and tradesmen before the gospel in the old times , and in the primitive times , when i refused the priests , Pharisees , and leaders of the persons in those days , and so those that pretend to be the heads and leaders of the persons , as priests and lawyers , even they shall drink deeper than any , of my sore displeasure , because their consciences will accuse them , and so condemn them ; for not doing that which they know they should do , and so they shall with the rest be thrown into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone ; which is not meant material fire or brimstone , but is meant the apprehensions which the ungodly shall have of me , who am a burning & consuming fire : not aprehending i their God to be a God of love and peace ; which thou daughter of Zion , whom i will bring with joy into Jerusalem , & will cause it to be built up in glory , & so will make you for to inhabit there shall do , by my rising upon you & causing of you to shine so to be glorious in all the earth . 

Lift up thine eyes round about , and see all they gather themselves together , they come to thee ; thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy sides , Oye my sons and daughters whom i will bring up into Judea , even you that are by nature Jew's , and so are natural Jews , lift up your eyes , behold , look , and behold , and see all they gather themselves together , even the gentiles gather themselves together for to come up to thee , oh Zion , whom i have gathered in Judea , and have made the praise of the earth even for the glory wherewith i will glorify thee , they shall ( Even the gentiles ) make inquire after you , because you are my chosen persons , and you are they to whom i will make out myself in glory to ; therefore shall they come , even those that shall believe that i will make you the praise of the earth ; they come , even the gentiles come to thee , because i have withdrawn myself from them , and will not be in their worships , neither will i cause them for to receive any joy or comfort in any place or kingdom , for to find rest for their spirits ; but at this place where i have appointed to bring thee , oh Zion , out of the hands of all thy enemies , and from the power of all they that hate thee ; for thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy sides , even thy sons and daughters , oh Zion , shall come from East , West , North , South , even from all places , to be partakers of that infinite joy , pleasure , and glory , which you shall enjoy ; sons they shall be , because they come after you to that full and perfect enjoyment of i the Lord of host , and nursed at thy sides , because they shall receive of that fullness which you did receive of before ; & therefore they shall come even as a child doth when he is hungry , & doth receive food with gladness ; even so shall all these that come up to thee , even thy sons and daughters , to be nursed at thy sides , come to thee as to their mother ; for Jerusalem abore is the mother of us all ; even come to thee ( Ö Jerusalem ) for comfort , hearing that i the Lord of host is pleased for to make out myself to thee in a more especial manner then formerly i have done ; and so to receive comfort from thee , even to suck , and be satisfied with the fullness of that consolation you do receive from the father : even to suck and receive comfort from the same fountain of life , even from i the Lord of host ; this shall be the state and condition of you , you shall have your fill , and be full , when others shall be in want , and not be satisfied ; and they that come up to you , shall drink abundance of my fullness , when they that tarry behind shall be deprived of my love , light , and glory ; so that they shall find no rest for their spirits , for i will make you to be like Noah's ark , that was a place of refuge for Noah and those that were in it , when others were destroyed in my wrath : even so i have appointed peace and rest to be with you , and nothing but trouble of conscience to the rest , and to those that tarry behind , and come not up to you ; but some there shall be that shall be like Noah's raven that he sent forth , which wandered up and down , and could find no rest for her feet , until it came into Noah's ark again ; even so shall some be troubled , and shall have no rest , until they come up to Jerusalem , the place of my love and favour , and the place where i have delighted to dwell , and will dwell forever , and whosoever comes up to that place , even to Jerusalem , the city wherein i have appointed them to dwell ; shall find rest , and be in peace , freed from sorrow and trouble ; even as the raven found peace in Noah's ark , and rested there . 

Then thou shalt see and flow together , and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged , because the abundance of the sea shall be converted , the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee , their multitudes of camels shall cover thee , the dromidaries of Midian , and Epha , all they from Sheba shall come they shall bring gold , and incense and shall show forth the praises of the Lord ; all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee , the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee , they shall come up with acceptance on my altar , and i will glorify the house of my glory . 

Now shall ye gather yourselves together , and rejoice , and be glad because of those that are converted , for to come up to thee , oh Zion , who hath been made a laughing stock in all nations , but now shall be made the praise of all nations , and that all shall come up to thee that will have any rest , or be satisfied with my fullness , even those that have been your great enemies shall now be glad to come to thee oh Zion , which shall be gathered to Jerusalem , with their gold and incense , to praise and magnify thee , and even i the Lord of host in thee , who have chosen thee to be the glory of all nations , look and see who are those that fly as a cloud , and as doves to the windows , even these be my sons and daughters , who are gentiles , and want rest , and seek for rest , but can find none , therefore hearing of my glory wherewith i make out myself to thee , oh Zion : in whom i am in the midst of thee , they fly as clouds , they hasten from their countries , even to come to thee : that so they May have rest and peace with thee oh Zion , in whom i the holy one of Israel is in the midst of , and will be King for ever . 

Surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish , for to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the Lord thy god ; and to the holy one of Israel , because he hath glorified thee , even these lands , as England for one , that shall be the first that strive to go to my persons , who have a long time been cast off , but now through my mighty power , will graft them into the true vine again : and they shall become glorious , and shall say , blessed be they that come in the name of the Lord , hosanna in the highest , though formerly through unbelief and hardness of heart they crucified my son Jesus , and so would not have him to be their King , because he did not come in pomp and glory , but came of a carpenters wife , and descended from so low a lineage : shall we ( Say they ) believe this man is the son of God , seeing that he is so poor and so mean , and seeing he came for to destroy our laws , and forms of worships and governments , and the old customs of offering up sacrifice , which was that law and testament that God gave unto Moses for us to observe and keep for ever ? therefore before they would part from their forms of worships , and so would have a new one : they would crucify my son Jesus , and would not then have him to be their King , for which cause i did cast them off , and so did cause them to be dispersed in all nations . 

But now i have in my mercy and pity towards them , remembered the covenant which i made to their father Abraham , that in him all nations shall be blessed and so will now restore them by my power from their enemies in what country or nation they be dispersed , and will make them to be gathered together into their own country , and now i will give them hearts to believe in me , and so willingly to receive me now i proffer myself to them to be their King , and they shall think him now happy that shall come in the name of the Lord , and shall cry hosanna in the highest that is , they shall willingly receive instructions ; from i the Lord of host whom they wait for and whom they do expect daily for to hear of some tha shall say the Lord of host cometh for to redeem them out of all their enemy's countries , and to bring them into their own land again , which tidings of their return they shall have from England first , and how the god of Jacob will appear to be their God , and so they shall see and know that their redeemer cometh , and made himself known to some English men for to bring them word , even the Jews that are dispersed about in Holland , and Spain Germany and Italy ; and how it is the pleasure of i the Lord of host , for to put my spirit of courage and valiantness for to make you that are dispersed in these countries , as Holland , France , Spain , Germany , & Italy , gather yourselves together , and so to meet all of you , and these whom i shall send out of England to you , for to meet in the year fifty ( One now a coming on ) in Italy , and i will be your rock and your strength , and will in chief be your leader , so that you shall not fear what man shall do unto you , for i have purposed and it shall surely come to pass that i will bring you to Jerusalem , and not only you , but all the rest that are dispersed of you in other countries , even for to make you the praise of the whole earth ; and i will stir up armies that shall fight for you , so that i will bring you safely into your own countries and will make the gentiles come with their gold and silver to you and you shall be honourable , and all your enemies that will not serve you shall perish , for that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish , yea those nations shall be utterly wasted , even the most proudest and stoutest King or governor shall be destroyed , even all their armies shall come to nothing , for it is my pleasure to bring down the high and mighty one , and so to lay him low , even will i not favour any , but will bring them all down to the ground , yea i will bring down that potent enemy that doth so highly exalt himself , and he shall come to nothing , even the pose of Rome i mean , and before the fifty five years that is now present & a coming , he shall be destroyed , even the Pope of Rome shall lose his life in 1654. and so i the Lord will make known my power , by cutting off great ones , and by bringing them to nothing , and so will make them all come bending and bowing to my sons and daughters , whom i will bring to Jerusalem ; and because it is my pleasure that it should be so , i even i the Lord of host will appear for to confound my enemies , and those that have been enemies to my persons the Jews : even that proud Turk that rules and domineers now , shall be before the year fifty seven consumed & destroyed , & the great head Turk shall lose his life in the year 1656 and so there shall never after him , nor never any more Pope be , but there shall be such alterations and changes , that things present , and have been by custom of long standing , turned upsides once again , that i May make Jerusalem the praise of the whole earth ; whose gates shall be continually open , and shall not be shut day or night , that men May bring unto them , even unto the new Jerusalem , the forces of the gentiles , even such abundance there shall be that shall be brought in for to be your fellows and brethren , one and of the same city , that the places which i formerly gave unto your fathers for their inheritances , shall be enlarged , and strangers shall build your city , even the walls of your cities ; even such shall build them up for you , that shall not inhabit there ; and Kings shall minister unto you , and shall bring their riches unto you , though you shall have no need of any ; yet it is my pleasure so much to magnify you , that i will make myself appear to be glorious in you , even in the midst of you : and will make persons say of a truth , that God is in you ; and so to acknowledge that you are the seed which the Lord hath blessed , and so to make them see and know , that i the Lord of host am in you , even in you all , ruling in you , and making all your enemies become subject to you . But i must tell you , that i will not appear personally for to reign over you , and so to give you laws to walk by , no , but i will reign in you , and i the god of truth will be in you , and i will teach you how you shall walk , by putting my laws in your inward parts , and in writing of them in your hearts , and so will speak in you , and will also make you for to worship me in spirit and in truth , & not in outward forms as now you do : for the glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , and the box tree , and the fir tree shall come together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary , and so to make my feet glorious ; such is the work of i the Lord of host , that i will make the very glory of the world be brought to Zion , even for to make them glorious ; and i will make the place of thy feet glorious , ö Zion , and all the sons of them , the feet that afflicted thee , shall come bowing and bending to the soles of thy feet ; and shall call thee the Zion , the city of the Lord , the holy one of Israel ; such a great work will i do for thee , ö Zion , that i will make thee have power over all thy enemies , and none shall be able for to oppose thee : but all shall be brought to nothing and confounded ; yea even they shall be in such terror and fear now , that they shall submit themselves to thee , and call thee , even thee oh Zion , whom i will gather to Jerusalem , the city of the Lord , even of i the Lord of host . And whereas thou hast been forsaken , so that no man went through thee ; even thee oh Jerusalem , that hath been laid wast ; i will now of a sudden make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations , even i will make thee to be so glorious , that thou shalt be the glory and joy of nations ; for thou shalt be freed from sorrow and trouble , and vexation of spirit , and shall live in peace , and be at peace , rejoicing in i the Lord of host ; when others shall be troubled and vexed , to think that they do not partake of the same glory wherewith i have and will glorify thee ; and thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles ; even that joy and comfort which formerly they had of me , when i did make out myself to them in forms of worships ; which joy and comfort you shall now have , and thou shall know that i the Lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer , the mighty God of Jacob : for brass thou shalt have gold ; and for iron , silver ; instead of outward forms , thou shalt have the pure enjoyment of i the Lord of host in spirit : and i will make such a work amongst you now , that instead of giving oppressors to be your officers , i will give you such that shall be peacemakers ; and i will make your officers or exacters over you now , to be righteous ; nay there shall be none any longer for to be officers one over another ; but you shall be all alike : for as the Master is , so shall be the man ; as the Mistress , so shall be the maid ; as the buyer , so shall be the seller ; even all alike , and none greater than other , but what one hath , shall be the others : for i will now make all things new ; for violence shall be no more heard with in thy borders , but thou shall call thy walls salvation , and thy gates praise : even thou ( Ö Zion ) that shall be gathered together in Judea ( And in those places thereabouts ) which by reason of the greatness of thy company , i will enlarge thy borders ; for i the Lord of host will be your walls and your gates , and will be salvation to you , for to keep and preserve you from all your enemies . 

The sun shall no more be thy light by day , neither for brightness shall the moon give light to thee , but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light , & thy god thy glory ; the sun shall no more go down , neither shall the moon withdraw herself , for the Lord shall be even i the Lord of the everlasting light , and i thy God thy glory ; and the days of thy mourning sha' be ended . Whereas thou hast been sorrowing up and down and hast i gone out of one country into the other , mourning and weeping , and so hast found no comfort : now these shall all pass from thee , and thou shalt weep no more : ö Zion , for the Lord hath founded thee ö Zion , and will be your King for ever , even your light , life , joy , and glory , even your all and all : so that thou shall not have need of outward ordinances , either one or the other : but i will be a sun and a moon for to give thee light , and for to make thee see : though it hath a long time been neither light nor dark , neither day nor night , but now in the evening there shall be light : even in these last days , light shall now shine in such a perfect and clear manner , that it shall be known to be light , for i the Lord of host will be sun-light , and moonlight , and will be day , and so indeed it will be very glorious , when i the Lord of host will never leave them , nor forsake them ; but will be always with them : even never withdrawing light from them , but always making it for to increase and grow , and multiply itself : till it comes to be seven fold more light then formerly there hath been : and until the weakest and feeblest that are among you be as David . and David as the angel of God , even as God , this shall be the estate and condition of you , ö Zion : whom i will gather together to Jerusalem , and so will make you the praise of the whole earth , even the very weakest of or among you shall know as much , and have as much knowledge as David had , and shall be in as great favour as David was with i the Lord of host , who hath commanded the writer hereof to write it as my will , and not as his will , because i have purposed to appear so bright and in such a glorious manner to them , making them partakers of my glory , that they shall have as much knowledge as David , and they shall be even as , angels of God , yea even angels , and shall know as much of God even of i the Lord of host , that they shall all be taught of i their God , and shall have no need of teachers to teach them , for i will be their teacher and instructor , and so will guide them in the way of truth , and from it they shall not err , neither shall slip aside as now they do , but they shall all of them be kept upright by my power , and i will not let them slip aside from me ; but will uphold them with my right hand , & will carry them in my bosom , and so will make them to rest in me as their only joy , even in i the Lord of host ; thy persons also shall all be righteous , they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the works of my hands that i May be glorified , even thee ö Judea , whom i have given to my saints for to inherit , and will bring all my sons and daughters up by degrees to thee , for to inherit and be there , even my choice and peculiar ones to be brought up to Jerusalem , the place which i have chosen for to make my name glorious : for i will make them appear to be the branch of my planting , and so they shall all be righteous , and not any one that shall be wicked shall be suffered to be there , no hypocrite or dissembler , or any one that worketh abominable mischief , or speaketh lies , shall be there , no , for it is my house and place where i have chosen to dwell , even in my saints , and i will now fulfil the prophecy , there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of the Lord for ever : but all shall be righteous and glorious , shining as so many stars in the firmament , and glistering so clear and so bright , that all the spectators shall be dazzled , for mine shall be as angels , for knowledge and glory , and power ; for in deed they shall be my angels , for a little one shall become a thousand , and a small one a strong nation , i the Lord will hasten it 〈◊〉 its time , even in those poor and despised ones , who are but small and little in comparison of the multitudes that are so great , even these poor and small ones shall increase and grow , even those who have now , the breaking forth of light in them in this nation of England which we were at the first but one , even that one that had light made out to him , as concerning his going to Jerusalem , even that one shall become a great nation , and a glorious nation , even the joy and praise of the whole earth ; which i the Lord will hasten in my own time , which now will be very shortly ; sing and shout ö daughter of Jerusalem ; sing aloud ö daughter of Zion , for behold thy King , the holy one of Israel is in the midst of thee , and thou shalt see evil no more : but now shall go with joy and rejoicing ; and with gladness of heart to Zion , singing and leaping for joy to the mountain of the house of the Lord which shall be in Judea , and there shall sing and dance with the tabret and pipe , and so shall have all kind of music and mirth : and thou shalt see sorrow no more , but weeping shall now be hide from thine eyes ; for i have called thee by a new name , and so have given thee a new name : for thou shalt no longer be termed desolate and forsaken , but thou shall be called the place where i the Lord of host delights to dwell ; for as soon as Zion traveled she brought forth , and was delivered of a man child ▪ who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such a thing , that a nation should be born at once ? but now as i live 〈◊〉 the Lord of host , it shall come to pass , for i will give them a new name , which none shall know but them that have it . My name changed from George Foster , to Jacob Israel Foster .
