A copy of a letter from an officer of the army in Jreland , to his highness the Lord protector , concerning his changing of the government . 

My Lord , 

I do not at all doubt but that your highness will wonder to receive a letter , and of this length , from so mean a person ; but when you shall be pleased to weigh that , no man who is not too mean to be calumniated , can be too inconsiderable to defend himself ; i make no question but you will think this boldness a necessity , and so pardon it : it is now near five years since i left England in your company , and under your command , ever since which time i have constantly resided with my charge here , one bare month excepted , for which space i had leave to dispatch some affairs in England . now for that my superiors here do refuse at present to give me permission to wait upon your highness in person , as also that i have small hopes otherwise , that your many weighty employments can ever admit me to be heard by you at large , i have presumed to write these few lines , beseeching you to believe the contents of them , as proceeding from an unfeigned heart , and to take a measure of me and my principles from hence , and not from such clandestine reports as May possibly be justilled into your ears , by those that are my enemies , and will be yours , when they shall have prevailed with you , to disgrace those that have been oldservants to the cause of liberty , and to your person , and to put yourself wholly at their mercy and discretion , whose deep policy hath made them desert their country for this last five years , during which time they have been little less than martyrs to Charles steward , and his interest : my Lord , i cannot answer to these objections against me , for which i am traduced to your highness , because i yet never heard them in particular , nor is there any charge against me that yet i can learn news of , only a rumor speaks me disaffected to your present power , and so not fit to be trusted any longer , to give answer to this , it would be necessary to understand the drift of this government we are now under which i protest i cannot , i mean , whether we are in the way to a glorious commonwealth for which we have engaged , & to which the great power which you are possessed of , May make us much nearer , if you please , or upon a transition , thinking the case of our liberty desperate , from a free state , to a lasting settled monarchy , when it shall appear to be the latter , i shall not at all conceal my disaffection , nor desire to retain my employment , that May give me a relation to that government , to expose which my life hath been so often hazarded , and my hand and my heart to so many solemn declarations against it , which together with mine own light and reason , would haunt and persecute me , like so many revenging furies , if i should dare to harbour an apostate thought of being instrumental to revert , as if it was nothing in the eyes of God and good men , to imbrue two nations in blood , to execute a great Prince , to destroy so many considerable persons and families , who now all beg their bread in foreign lands , and to take the food out of the mouths of the poor , and their beds from under them for taxes and impositions , and all this to the intent to support that liberty which nature hath bestowed upon mankind , and then to make no more use of the most miraculous mercies of God , and the precious blood and ••arss of so many worthy and religious patriarchs , then to make them instrumental to pull down a legal monarchy , for being somewhat too tenacious of certain power prejudicial to common freedom , and at the same time to set up , and introduce without form of law , justice , or consent ( No not of the army itself as is suggested ) an arbitaary boundless power solely subservant to the exorbitant will and unsupportable ambition of one single person , and that for ever , who is to have thirty thousand men , who are not to be disbanded , nor the money for their entertainment laid or altered by parliament , these are to be his janissaries , and their work to enslave the persons in these nations , to the lusts of their grand senior . for if he have any foreign emergencies he May raise more : what hard-hearted men were those in parliament , who thought the Earl of Stratford worthy of death , for telling the late King , he had an army in Ireland , which he Might employ to reduce his subjects here to their obedience , and how severe were these grave and learned lawyers , who judged that speech treason , even at the common law , and now think it none for themselves , to act in seats of judicatory , execute laws , and hang men , and yet have no power to authorise them therein , but what is derived from such another trick , as that Earl would have then played ; to be short , if i should examine that paper cal•ed the government , i should hardly find a line in it , which is not destructive to our cause and liberty , so that it appears plainly to be a monarchy bottomed in the sword , or to come nearer the right name , a commonwealth established in a Lord protector , and thirty thousand men , these considerations my Lord , do prevail with me , to believe that your highness do not intend to continue this form of government upon us , but have assumed the power for a time , that you May be able to accomplish the work of liberty amongst us , which the parliament consisting of divers persons , of several and different capacities , was not able to establish , and this seems more probable to me , not only from your own oaths , protestations , and excellent principles against monarchy , but even from the consideration of the ticklish and slippery posture in which all monarchies do stand , who have no foundation of their right and government , but an armed force ; how often have the P•eto•ian bands , the Turkish & Rushian armies proved more fatal and tyrannical to their own Princes , then to their poor oppressed vassals , and it seems to be agreeing both to divine justice , and human reason , that an armed multitude , which by the preswasions of one man , hath broken all the bonds of law and conscience , to serve his interest , and enslave their country ; should when the tide of their fancy or passion turns , think themselves as well absolved and disengaged from all reverence and obedience to their own captain . 

Since i have said thus much it will be needless to speak more in praise of a free state , for that the best and most limited monarchies are but perpetual contests between the interest of mankind , and that of one person , each striving industriously which shall ruin and undermine the other , & in that government flattery and unworthy insinuations are turned up trump , without which no man can win in such a game , which gives a plain reason why the most virtuous Princes , as Marcus Aurelius , Antonius Pius , and others , could never make their persons so ; the interest of their government being wholly contrary thereunto ; for if the principle of virtue and justice should be sown , and come up , they would have that growth and increase , which would in short time overtop the interest of one person , & so destroy the state ; as hath been seen by the experience of those governments which have erected themselves out of the ruin of monarchy , where the Prince hath been so unadvised , to suffer his persons to attain to riches , and so get good education , for that the great concernment , or reason of state in Kings and tyrants , is to keep mankind poor and ignorant , which the Greeks and Romans understood well , when they styled those nations who lived under the command of one man , barbarians , just point blank contrary to this , are the principles and maxims of a commonwealth , which is the nursery of virtue , valour , and industry , where no court whispers , no pimping projecting , or such arts , can bring advantage to those who practise them , but only a public spirit expressed in just and honourable actions , must advance and prefer persons to the highest offices and employments , this lays a foundation for the constant succession of g•n•••us and worthy patriots , this makes a persons rich and free , ••pp•e at home , and formable abroad , and history , which is the best reason in this point , will plainly show , that the worst and meanest of commonwealths , have been more rich , powerful and populous , than the same country could ever be under a Prince ; i take the most factious and corrupt estate in story ; to have been that of fl•rence , yet did that commonwealth for many years together give law to Italy , and when they had war with part of their own territories , as Pisa , and its country , did for many thousand years maintain sixty thousand men , whereas the same dominions now under a Duke , with the addition of the state of Sienna , is not able to raise or maintain twelve thousand men ; for when the present Prince was necessitated in the year one thousand six hundred and forty three , to make an inconsiderable war against the Pope in company of Parma , Modena , and the Venetian , and that for but one summer , he was reduced to such extremity , that he hath been forced to sell his galleys , and wholly to neglect the sea , and yet those persons that are left in his dominion , are much more oppressed by impositions , then in the days of liberty ; i will not speak of England , because it was never yet a commonwealth , though it hath past a civil war , and all other sufferings which belongs to a change , yet this must and will be said , that all those actions of honour , which our Kings for six hundred years have performed , did not bring more renown ; nor so much advantage to these nations , as the achievements of the same persons when they had no Prince , and but the name only of a free state ; and if for our sins it be decreed that we shall never be so ; i dare almost prophecy that the actions of succeeding monarchies will not outdo , nor perhaps not equal these , and then posterity will have leave to think , that all the wisdom , valour , and activity of these nations was not residing in one single person ; but i have dwelled too long upon this , and shall only conclude , that if all kingdoms be near their period and ruin , when the subjects' under them grow rich , wise , and capable of understanding their own good , and contrariwise , that commonwealths do not decay , but when their persons in general grow poor ; and ignorant , and the riches of the nation comes to be engrossed by a few , who by that means can buy voices to get into command , and then bribe soldiers to uphold them in their ambitious designs , to enslave their country , the poverty and abjectness of the persons , making them fit for the impression ; then it must necessarily follow , that those in whose hand and power it is to settle and establish what form of government they please , aught to improve that power for erecting a free state , or a commonwealth ; this is the case of your highness , who besides your oaths and trust , have this obligation more , that you know , and are persuaded in your conscience , that this is a more excellent form then monarchy , as you have thousand of times expressed yourself , and particularly in that declaration which you composed here , and published when you entered the province of Munster , 1649. in which you have most excellent and unanswerable reasons for a popular government , which shall make me say no more of this business ; but come to bring it to our present condition , because it is alleged ( And indeed to that we owe this change , which hath brought upon us so much distraction & unsettlement , that we were not capable being a free state , and so that you by necessity have been forced upon these courses , to prevent confusion ) i am not ignorant , that nothing is more commonly said and believed amongst the vulgar , than this error , and it is besides industriously fomented by some subtle grandees , who knows their great riches , titles , knavish cunnings , and such useless qualities , will not prefer them to that dignity and eminency in such a government , as they hope to enjoy under a Prince , whom they can soothe and flatter , i must confess , to look upon the present humour of the persons , as they are divided into factions , & animated against the parliaments managing affairs , a rational man Might believe , that as their passions do hinder them from seeing the advantage of a commonwealth , so they would likewise hinder them from obeying it ; but those who shall consider on the one hand their punctual obedience , not only to all laws , but even to these ordinances , which are now called so , and that undoubtedly against their judgement , as well as their affections ; and on the other side their genuine inclinations , and before this war , when they were free from factions , and in puris naturalibus , to freedom , which was plainly seen by their joining unanimously with the house of Commons , in their contest against their King : i say whosoever shall observe that , must needs say , that a small force joined with good principle , and honest governors , will soon reduce them to their natural disposition and temper again , if thirty thousand men can support this government , then ten thousand Might maintain freedom , which would quickly come to subject by itself without any force at all ; which all states do , that are established upon a right basis , viz upon the natural temper and humour which the posture and condition of the persons puts them into , if they be poor and low , monarchy May serve their turn , if rich , they would look to have share , rule & magistracy themselves : whosoever then would , found a government which he intends not , shall subject by force ( For if he do it , matters not what he makes it ) Might above all things , observe these accidences , which ruined the precedeing state , for every form of government which crumbles and false to ruin , by the weakness of its own pillars , must have a new fabric , or mend the old , one just in the place , first break , if it be capable of it , and whosoever shall look backe into the turns and revolutions of state ; will find , that all changes in government have been mending of old frames , or making of new ones , & as legislators or senates , have gone to the root of nature in this , have not palliated or patched up the cure , so nations have been happy or unhappy , free or slaves , governed by force continually , or by consent , and states durable , or short lived , is true , that our unhappiness is that great alterations seldom come without intestine wars , it being hard ( Especially in populous and flourishing cities , to bring the multitude to give so great a power to one man as is necessary to redress a disordered state , and for that men are generally short sighted , and cannot foresee great inconveniences till they are too late to remedy , but by force , this makes the cure oftentimes miscarry , as in the case of the Gracchis at Rome , and of Agis and Cleomenes at Sparta , in both which examples , there was an endeavour to reduce those two excellent states , to their first principles , but it was too late attempted , when the corruption was grown to too great a height , which if they had found , and would have been contented to erect a new form more suitable to the inequality of men's estates at that time , they Might possibly have succeeded , if not to have introduced so good and excellent a model as they fell from , yet one able to have prevented the ruin and slavery which soon after befell both these persons ; not to make the business longer , i will instance in the example of our own nation , the first history of which , ( It is not esteemed fabolous ) is that we were invaded and conquered by William the Norman , who either ruled by his own will , or made the law rule , which he gave at his own pleasure ; his French Lords left posterity behind them , who in process of time grew so rich and powerful , that they did not think it fit to be governed by the discretion of one man , but believed , they Might deserve and share in rules themselves , for there is nothing more fundamental by nature , then that those who possess a land will desire , and by all means attempt to govern it , which is the true reason of what was alleged before , viz. that it is against the interest of a monarchy , to let his subjects grow rich ; from this contest of the Lords , with succeeding Kings , began the Baron's wars , and in the close of them our government , by Kings , Lords , and Commons , wherein , although the Commons were named , it will be found ( If we look into records , that they had little share , except to help bear up the Lords , whose blew-coats they wore against the King ) and it will likewise appear , that they were never discontented at their small proportion , and the reason is the same with the former , viz. that either they possessed no lands at all , or else he held them as servants to their loving Lords and clergy , so that this state was founded with great wisdom , upon the very condition of the persons , which had it continue the same it than was , could never have been shaken , but by a foreign war ; but all great bodies are well politic as natural , receive great alteration and corruption , and though in good mixtures they commonly tend to decay and ruin , yet where the crasis is bad , there May be accedents which May incline to amend it , and that without the knowledge of the parties , who are the subject matter of the change , and as wine changes itself by working , so many times the natural humour of a nation tends from the corruption of a monarely , to the erecting of a popular state , though whilst they are in motion , they May not possibly understand whether their own impulse doth incline and lead them , this will prove to be the case of England ; for when Henry the seventh had established himself King , and saw plainly that he did owe his acc•ssed to the crown , more to the favour of those Lords who assisted him , then either to his own sword or title , he began to consider in how ticklish a posture he stood , whilst it was in the power of any small number of Lords to set up , or pull down a sovereign at their will , and upon this contemplation he made it his whole aim and work to lessen and debase the nobility , that he Might have the less to apprehend in his new-gotten royalty , by which he laid the foundation of destroying his posterity , not considering at all that the Lords could not be diminished , but by advancing and enriching the Commons , whose desire of power must necessarily increase accordingly , which if they could obtain , it was then obvious that they must strike not at this or that Prince , but at the very root of monarchy itself , as being a thing useless wholly to them , and indeed inconsistent with their government and interest : Henry the eight continue in the same policy , and amongst many other accidents of increasing the power of the commonwealth , to the settling the militia in deputy lieutenant , it happened in his days that religious houses being taken away , most of the lands and manors belonging to them , some for monies , others for donations , fell into the hands of the Commons ; this was the first time they began to bear up with the Lords , who since have been abased and impoverished by many accidents , as by finding a means to cut off intails , whereby it came to be in the power of those who were in present possession , to sell their posterity and revenues , and so to ruin the Lords who succeeded them , ( Which estates too ) being most what spent in court vices and luxury , lost the interest of the peers in their countries , and made them contemptible to the whole nation , and slaves to the citizens , who by their prodigalities grew into great wealth , and possessed their lands ; about this time trade beyond sea increased , and abuses in the law growing up , made that a wealthy profession , so that incensibly foundations of great families amongst the Commons were laid , whilst the Lords grew daily to decay , and that which brought them to nothing at last , was doubtless the Scotch race of Kings , who whether by design , or for want of prudence , is not known , made so many worthless persons peers here , as well Scotch as English , and those too for the most part so inconsiderable in point of estate , that the persons did universally detest the government , as we May observe by the constant unquietness of their representors in parliament , there scarce having been one in the two last Kings reigns , which were not dissolved abruptly by them , so little complying were they to his government : now though i am no ways ignorant that the dissensions which happened between those Kings and their parliaments , had very good ground on the people's side , as the taking away grievances , and the like , yet the natural cause ( And which was a long time collecting ) was the height of the Commons , and the meanness of the Lords , and the King , who had by this time sold and given away all his revenues ; and this too will appear to have been the original of these civil wars , for although the last action , which drove us into it , will ever be acknowledged to have been the King's misgovernment , yet as we are apt to say in malignant fevers , that the last excess we made drove us into it , though the body had been gathering that pestilential mass many years before ; so in this case the essential and natural cause of this state disease , was much longer in collecting , than the ship-money , or the loan ; and this is clear , for that the persons did support much more than those from their Prince and landlords too , whilst they were poor , and never did stomach to be governed , even arbitrarily , by those upon whom they were necessarily to depend in point of estate and subsistence , it being then , my Lord , so clear and evident , that the riches of the persons in general , is the natural cause of destruction to all regal states : i desire to bring this to our present discourse , and will beg leave to ask your highness' leave , whether the commonalty of England be grown poorer than they were when this was began , or rather , whether they are not become so much more rich , as the lands and manors of King , Bishops , Dean and chapters , and of all the great delinquent Lords , together with free-farm rents , could make them ; if this be granted , it must be then concluded , that we are farther off from a capacity of being governed by monarchy again , then when we first began this quarrel ; so that you see that it is so far from being true , that the nation of England is not fit at all to be a commonwealth , that indeed it is wholly impossible to make it any other , without an excessive force and violence ; so that my Lord , if your highness shall yet resolve to detain from us our liberties , with which you were entrusted , you will not only offend against your own oaths and principles , against common right and justice , but even against God and nature too , for that it will be impossible for you to mend this frame where it first broke , except you can take from the persons their estates , and confer them upon old or new Lords , which will be hardly safe for you to attempt , it hath been my unhappiness to make this discourse somewhat too long for a letter , but i have been forced to rove too far into the nature of government in general , before i could show the principles of a free-state , and how near we are to it , if you please , so near , that the cavaliers themselves in their hatred to the parliament , and now to yourself , do fully manifest , that they abhor all superiors , and are impatient to be governed by others ; and this very humour in them , is a secret impulse towards a commonwealth , which although they do not now understand to be so , yet they would soon do it , if they had what they immediately desire , for i am fully persuaded , if their darling Charles Stewart could be brought in by them , and all his opposers wholly rooted out , he would not be able without a standing army to maintain the old government , even amongst his own party , so much is the case altered now , and so strong and natural the motives which draw towards liberty . i must confess these speculations were no part of the cause which induced me first to take up arms first for the parliament , but did come into my thoughts since by discourse , what i did originally look at , was the justness and honesty of the cause , the excellency of liberty , the glory of advancing and promoting the interest of mankind , the making my nation more wise , valiant , happy , and honest then before , as well as more free , which i cannot yet despair of whilst i see you alive , whose noble and unwearied endeavours to that end , can never be forgotten , when the King , the Scots , and half the parliament combined against us , you could not be daunted , when your own grandees would have persuaded you out of those principles , you would not be circumvented , but did often say , that towards the attaining of a just and upright government , an ounce of honesty and resolution , was worth a pound of sneaking policy : oh let not those men who have suffered for your enemies get that upon you , by soothing your ambition , which they could never do by opposing your reason , let not those instruments , who have deserted the cause of liberty , be now made use of to destroy it , and by advising you to purge the army , make those janissaries , whose glory it was once , they would not acknowledge themselves to be mercenaries , put not yourself upon the discretion of those whose love is not to you , but to monarchy , and when they shall have made you a while the instrument of their ambition and avarice , will in the least adversity look back to the old line again , which they scarce ever yet offended , and when that shall be understood by Charles Stewart and his Hector's , and that there shall be nothing standing in their way hither , but your life , the ancient asserters of liberty being laid by with shame , and those who were once outed for opposing it , stepped into their places , in how hazardous and desperate a condition is that life of yours like to be , which hath been hitherto so precious to all the honest party in these nations ; consider therefore that those grandees are like fire and water , good servants , but very dangerous Masters , let them do your drudgery , but let them not steer your counsels , trust this nation with their freedom , posterity with your fame , and God for a reward ; we know we cannot be free without your help , till we have undergone a thousand confusions in the way , our factions will not suffer us to agree in any thing , except you lead us into that frame which will fit us , and to make which , you May find persons enough to assist you , if you please to seek them ; and who knows but that the wise providence of God , seeing the failings of the parliament hath permitted you to assume this great power , to that end , do not offend that God whom you have so often called to witness of the integrity of your heart ; consider , that if you will not build us up that fabric of a free state , you must be the first to lose your own liberty ; do but weigh the fears and the uncertainties you will be in , whilst you live , and the almost inevitable necessity that your posterity must be destroyed when you are gone , as well as ours , or let this prevail with you , at least to make us a commonwealth , because you can make us nothing else ; if you believe yourself not safe without this power , pray consider how many plots and designs there were against you when you were our general , and how many nights sleep you broke then in examinations , nay remember , if during the trial of the late King , you did not walk the streets often with one servant , or without one , whereas now , new troops and regiments must be raised , and the old recruited , and all thought too little to preserve you ▪ and yet the lives of all the honest patriots in England were then wrapped up in yours , as much as now , and their interest more ; but if yet after all this , that detestable poison of ambition , and desire of domination , have taken so far possession of you , that no antidote can expel it , and that nothing will satisfy you , but to destroy that liberty which you were appointed guardian to ; and to outdo him whom you have pulled down and executed : i must profess to all the world , that though i shall ever acknowledge that i owe much of my being settled in the principles of freedom , which i now adhere to , to your former excellent discourses , and most excellent actions ; yet that i cannot find any thing in my conscience that will persuade me to change with you , but shall wash my hands from the guilt and infamy of your ways , and withal lay down my commands , and all other relations to your government , that so i May deliver you from the apprehensions , which i believe you are in , that you cannot find a specious pretence to discharge me from my employments , though the series of your former behaviour in that kind towards your friends , makes me believe you will be soon provided of a cause to lay me by , for you have hitherto ( As i May so say ) rid so fast , that you have seemed to be mounted rather upon post-horses , than those which were your own , leaving them still at their stage's end , and taking fresh ones ; one while none but Barkley Legg and Ashburnham must serve your turn , and the King must either be brought in , or it must be thought so , soon after , when his head comes to be cut off , the levellers must when that is well over , the Presbyterian must be courted till the war of Scotland be ended , and their nest fired ; next to this an expedient in religion must be thought upon , and a committee for propagation appointed , into which , as into the ark , all kind of creatures must enter , soon after this Blackfriers men must be encouraged to cry this down , and the parliament too , for going on too fast with it , and for not reforming the laws , till at length they being preached ripe for destruction , the members of parliament must be removed , and such honest godly persons chosen to succeed them , as May make the persons forget monarchy ; but these are presently cashiered too , for endeavouring to perform what they were called for , as if they had been summoned only to beat a commonwealth out of the pit , and serve for a foil for the new monarchy ; next , because we have no more varieties of fashions or instruments , we must revert to our monarchical grandees again , these are now the only wise men , for having disinherited you , and foreseen all this , the only firm states men , for sticking to their principles , these must now be called the honest party , whilst those who were so the last year are styled factious fellows , and to make this relish the better , there must be sought out instruments of an inferior capacity to the grandees , who never had any other principles than fear and avarice , and who never disdained to be flatterers in any age , i mean divines and lawyers , whom the late fright they were in for tithes and reformation , hath made them now more supple then formerly ; the first of these must now preach up tyranny , as much as ever they have done liberty , they who once said the persons , or the saints , were the Lord's anointed , must now recant that doctrine , and say its the Lord's protector , and must even prostitute the jus divinum of their ordination itself , to an ordinance of your highness , and for the latter , they must make that just and honourable in you , which they thought . Treason in the Earl of Stafford ; those who condemned ship-money , must cry up the monthly taxes in their circuits and charges , and such who scrupled council-table orders formerly , must now swear to , and judge by such laws , as you can make a dozen in an hour , without the trouble of twice reading or engrossing , nay , the same persons must be a high court , and hang men for striving to oppose monarchy to day , who yesterday did the same to them who would have brought it in : but my Lord , we will have patience to expect the end , it will be that which must give the denomination to all this , which if it terminate in liberty , will be esteemed prudent policy , if in the contrary , it will have another name ; but least your highness should think , that either myself , or any honest man here , do place our hopes of a good issue to this business in the next parliament , as you call it , i will presume to disabuse you in that particular , and give you that which i conceive to be the judgement of the world concerning it , at well as mine : first , than my Lord , it is understood to be a creature of your will and power , the definition of the places , the qualification of the persons , the summons , and all other incidents belonging unto it , deriving themselves wholly from you , and your assumed office , so that if there be a flaw in the justice of legality , of that which is the foundation , what can be hoped for in the superstructure ? it Might be objected in the next place , the persons having already chosen a parliament , which have not received any formal , ( Or as it was once called ) legal determination , could not be in a capacity to choose another , because this would seem to grant , that any prevailing violence Might , even in that sense of law , dissolve a parliament ; but i leave this as that which comes too near treason ; another thing which renders the whole scrupellous is , that your highness should think the persons fit to have a share in government , and give laws , and yet should make yourself so far paramount to them at the same time , as to confine them by the instrument and indentures , what power they shall delegate to their trustees , if the original of all just power be in the persons , as we have been taught by the parliament , how comes there to be a jurisdiction superior to theirs , which must command them what to do with that power , and what instructions to give those who represent them ? but if that doctrine be not true , what need they be disturbed in their harvest work , to choose and send needless ciphers up to London ? and why cannot you rather , either as you do now , make laws still with the consent of rhe major part of seven men , or without it , or else take the pains , as you did lately , to name the persons , to be summoned yourself , this had savoured of much more ingenuity , and would have made us hope this deplorable estate we are now in , had been to last no longer than till you , with the advice of wise and honest patriots , had been able to frame a model of present freedom for us , whereas things standing thus , there are sad apprehensions , that the countenance of a parliament , and not their counsel , is sought for , and that specious pretence to deceive the vulgar are more aimed at and desired , then either the present good of the nation , or any design of settlement for the future , and really what advantage could have been expected from the last parliament , if the King , which called it , had encumbered it with an indenture , that they should have power only to have secured his ends , but not to alter the government , though he had taken them man by man , and murdered them , and doubtless this must be a precedent for all Kings and other usurped powers , which shall succeed in England , to put all their commands , lusts and projects into writing , and deliver them for a lesson to the persons at their choice , till they have made their indentures as long as Drury house conveyance , till such time as the persons of those nations , like the natives under the Spaniard in the Indies , shall be capable of no other office or employment , but to summon and bring in their fellows to the mines , and make them slaves ; one advantage more towards tyranny in this business is , that those blocks laid in the way , will discourage many wise and honest patriots , from suffering themselves being elected , and so the credit and reputation of this new junto , will be as small as its authority , only this will render them somewhat more fit to serve the end for which they are appointed , viz. either to confirm this power as it is , or settle the old royalty in your line , or else perhaps find out some mongrel expedient , by which they will seem to retrench some part of this arbirrary sovereignty , and by that means , as much as in them lies , authenticate the rest ; but the truth is , they do perform all that by summoning in ; and not only so , but make all these poor blind persons who elect them , to submit themselves to a voluntary slavery , by owning an authority destructive to their freedom , for either those they send , must not attempt to do them any service , or if they do , be perfidious and break their trust , since the only call they can pretend to , is the people's choice , and even by them they are confused by an instruction to approve this government , and so undo all that hath been building up towards our liberty for these fourteen years : next my Lord , because it is commonly reported here that your highness intends to resign your power , entirely and absolutely into the hands of those men when they are met , i will crave leave to say a word to that , to the end , you May perceive that there are some honest persons even in Ireland who are undeceived in that point . First than they conceive you May , as well and justly resign it to your council , they being equally your creatures , and then they observe the fallacy of leaving those men free , whom you have caused to be bound ere they came there , and with such chains as you yourself cannot loosen , no more than a foreign Prince can give an ambassador sent from hence authority to negotiate beyond his commission , and those bonds which you have laid upon them are concerning the very essence of our liberty , viz. the government by one person , which you were once so fully persuaded of that you said in your declaration here , that you did believe that God was entering into a contest with Kings and priests , and would very suddenly open the eyes of the nations , so that within few years , there should not be either left in the whole world . cease then , my Lord , to flatter yourself any longer with an opinion that the well affected persons of any of these nations will think any better of your monarchy than they now do , when you shall seemingly have laid it down to those men who have no power for any thing , but to restore it to you ; and who are besides a product of your own will . A civil army raised by yourself to handle the estates of your persons , as the other perhaps do their persons when they are purged and fitted to the principles of a Turkish empire , and possibly you had this , this thought when you made this model , that because it was probable ( And it fell out since ) that the most wise and honest part of the gentlemen of England would not suffer themselves to be persuaded to come into your council , nor own your government , therefore you would make the persons of that nation your lictors , who should send you four hundred men bound hand and foot to perform your commands , and who should have power to tax , poll , and oppress them , but not the least shadow of any to relieve them : and here i cannot chose but touch at one thing often alleged ; and it is , that if you do rightly and duly administer justice , the nation will be happy that you took this power , for it matters not who governs so they govern well , for my part i wholly dissent from , and detest this opinion , and do conceive it to have been invented first by some lawyer or other flatterer , merely to satiate their present apostasy , for if it will be granted that there is in the most pure and incorrupt part of mankind , a natural instinct or inclination to liberty in government ( Which is for aught i know ) the only thing that distinguishes them from beasts for that the creature hath no reason , or no religion , cannot infallibly be said by us as it can , that they never attempt to rule themselves by laws but suffer a monarchy over them , to be either in the strongest of themselves , or in us , without ever attempting to assert their freedom ) than it will likewise be confessed that it is a vile and an unnatural passion in us which makes us prefer estate , much more a little quiet or ease , before that liberty which is so essential to us , and for this i have the example of all those excellent persons and nations whom their own hazards and adventures in this behalf have styled so in the universal esteem of all mankind ; indeed if the contrary to this were true , it would follow as Mr. Goodwin holds , that any person who believeth in his conscience that he could govern better than others do , might , nay is bound to use all means to attain to power , and acquire the government , the consequence of which will be that if any man will call his ambition conscience , no known laws , no constitution of estate , no common right , in fine nothing divine or human aught to stand in this way . I dare go yet farther and affirm that nothing can be more pernicious to these nations at this present , then for you to govern well , for it would palliate the assumed power , and so hide it from the just indignation of this age , and prove like the guilding of poisonous pills , or painting of sepulchers , and be a bribing us out of our rights and liberties with a seeming justice , nothing but this can jull asleep so many patriots , who have been often awakened with drums and trumpets , to adventure their lives against a tyrant ; neither indeed could any other thing than the just and happy reign of Augustus Caesar , have given the last defeat to the Roman liberty , or made way for those monsters who succeeded . You see then my Lord what a business you have undertaken , when you have made it the interest of honest men to wish that you May commit all excesses , and use more violence , break more laws and ties , in carrying on this arbitrary sovereignty than you have done in the assuming of it . My Lord , i beseech your highness to pardon the length of this letter , which could not well have been made shorter , for that the intention thereof is to evince , first , that to continue this present government upon us or any thing like it , would be most injurious in you , not only because it is most contrary to your own trust and oaths but even against common right and justice , and in the next place that there is no necessity of a new erected royalty , the nature and condition of those nations being so proportionable to a commonwealth that we are no way fit to receive any other form , but by an outward force and violence , besides that we have spent our blood and fortunes for it , and in the last place to show that we are not easily deluded into a belief , that either the next assembly or any expediencies that arise from thence have any right or likelihood to mend our conditions ; i shall next give your highness a short account of myself , and then humbly take my leave . I took up arms with the first in the quarrel of the parliament , not as a mercenary , as not having before my eyes the temptation of my Masters pay or the spoil of their enemies , but purely and solely out of a conscientious desire to free my nation from slavery and oppression , and having confirmed my judgement in this , i did examine my zeal and resolution , and believed it had enough of both to hazard myself , for such a cause ; in which expectation i thank the Lord , i have not yet found myself deceived ; how i have behaved myself since i came under your command , it would seem vanity for me to relate , if my former and present usage did not make it necessary for me to say that for my justification , which i should never have said for boasting ; this excuse makes me bold to lay before you some of my services , as well as my personal discouragements : your highness May please to remember , ( Here some particulars are left out which would detect the person who wrote the letter ) notwithstanding all which i am yet satisfied to go on with my employment here , and to be faithful in it , as being for the advancement of the common cause and against the common enemy , and yet if i were assured that you did intend to perpetuate upon us this slavery ( After you had disolved the parliament , for an imputation of endeavouring to perpetuate themselves ) i should have many scruples against serving you in Scotland , whither we are very liable to be transported ; for what reason is there that we should not give them leaves to be governed by their native King , and whom they had received by their parliament ? and at the same time seek to impose upon them by force another Prince of our nation , whom we had chosen for them , or rather had chosen himself , what can you think my Lord the just God , who hath been used to decide upon appeals would do in this quarrel , if they should have recourse to him with faith and prayer ? Alas my Lord you do not consider how much these thoughts do weaken the hands and hearts of those poor righteous and precious souls , who are yet left in the army and who pour forth their tears and prayers daily before the Lord on your behalf , that you May find mercy in this day of your temptation , that so they May not be traduced to have slain so many men as bravoes to your designs , and that you would make use of the great power you are now possessed of to settle and transmit to succeeding ages a state of lasting freedom which a small trouble and force would accomplish , whereas this government must be eternally supported by violence , no unnatural things being permanent without it , or if this cannot be , their prayers and desires are that you would summon a free unlimited parliament ( Consisting of such that have not forfeited their liberties ) not bound or fettered by indentures , and divesting yourself of all power and command , you would leave the whole sway & government to them , and swear the army to obey them , by this means the nation would either enjoy their liberty , or have the choice & imposition of their own yoke ; nor is there any reason except you will do one of these , upon which you can excuse the dismission of the parliament , for that it was within their power and design to make indentures in the behalf of liberty , which would have had an unquestionable authority as well as a more noble end , than those you have compelled for the contrary ; if you shall wholly refuse all things of this kind , and obstinately resolve to go forward in your way you now take , you will want the hands , hearts and prayers of all God's persons in these nations ; and though the principles of some of them May not give leave as private men to make you any further opposition , yet they will wash their own hands , and deliver their own souls , and beseech the just God of heaven and earth , who hath appeared so visibly and miraculously for this cause of freedom , and whom no hypocrisy can deceive , no false oaths , nor tears prevail upon to judge between you and these poor oppressed and deluded persons , but if yet you shall answer their hungry expectations of liberty ; you will give glory to God , increase to his church , flock and religion , which hath been grievously dishonoured by those actions , immortal fame to yourself , safety to your posterity , happiness to mankind , and will have the lives of many thousands entirely at your service and command , and amongst the rest that of

Postscript . 

reader , that this letter should not be exposed to public view so long after the date thereof , i hope will not possess thee with any prejudice against it the honesty and reason of the tract and faithfulness of the author to that good old principle of common justice , equity and liberty , secured in the most noble form of government , viz. the people's representative May commend it to thee , indeed that hath been the axletree of the cause which God so signally blessed us in , and since it was broken ( although upon pretence of going faster on in the obtaining of our liberties ) hath blasted us , wherein that saying is verified melius in via claudicare quam extra viam currere . it was the design of the old , so it is of the new court , to estrange the persons from , and work them out of love with parliaments , many honest well meaning men being too much led away with that mistake . The author mentioneth his fear of the last representative not of their judgement in , & affection to the public cause of liberty , but by reason of that restriction in the indenture framed to serve the interest of the present protector . But indeed the gentlemen deserve an honourable esteem from all English men , who though they could not do the good desired by us , and doubtless intended by them , yet would not do us the evil ( which a powerful party endeavoured to court and threaten them unto ) in perpetuating by any act of theirs our vassalage to the present grandees , or revoke those acts which maketh it treason for any single person to assume the supreme magistracy . I shall only add this as the earnestly desire of myself and of many who are friends to the good old cause , that the Lord would be pleased to guide us in the attaining of a free representative , which May assert our liberties , and secure them to posterity , which will be a glorious answer to the faith , prayer , expense of blood and treasure , both of the godly and likewise of the rest of the freeborn persons of England who have been faithful to the common cause of justice and liberty .
