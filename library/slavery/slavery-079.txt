A cure for the state . 

Or , an excellent remedy against the apostasy of the times . 

An excellent composition of Sir Henry Vane's affection to the ministry , of Sir Arthur Hesilrigg's honesty , of Henry Martin's chastity , of the Lord Fleetwood's valour , of an high court of justice mercy , of each two grains ▪ two law-arguments of Baron Wilde's own making , two ounces of the shavings of the Lord mayor's beard , one scruple of alderman tichborn's conscience , seven drops of alderman atkin's elixary , one pound of the city's slavery , one dram of kiffen's divinity , with three full gallons of widows and orphans tears , boil all these together the full time of one of doctor Owen's sermons at the fast of the house , then close stopped up with the paste of Scotch charity , the speakers religion , and Sir Gilbert's constancy . 

Two spoonfuls of this taken every morning fasting , will preserve you from the like apostasy , that the army and other saints have of late fallen into , and make you stick close to the parliament . 

Approved by the college of physicians ▪ 

Made public for the good of the commonwealth .
