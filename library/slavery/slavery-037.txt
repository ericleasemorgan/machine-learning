The real cause of the nations bondage and slavery , here demonstrated , and the way of their freedom , from their sore and hard bondage asserted . Presented unto the parliament of the commonwealth of England , who have a power and opportunity put into their hands to do good ( And to fulfil the expected ends of many ) if they improve it . From one that hath seen the corruption which bondageth the whole creation , and that waits for the redemption of the creature from under it , Richard Hubberthorn .

When this is fulfilled in England , it shall be truly called a free nation , or commonwealth , ( not before ) 

London , printed for Thomas Simmons , at the bull and mouth near Aldersgate , 1659.  

There hath been a time when the prudent hath kept silence , but now wisdom hath opened her mouth , and will be justified of all her children , for the Lord is reviving the spirit that hath been imprisoned , and taking the yoke from off the disciple necks , and is going on in the name of his power , to make his creature a free creature , & his persons a free persons , and the nation that serves him , & obeys his law , a free nation ; and the thunderings of his power is gone forth , and his light is risen to discover and destroy that which hath deceived the nations , and to give a discerning unto all , of their freedom from their bondage , and in what it stands ; and that is to be cast out which gendereth to the bondage of soul , spirit or conscience , in any exercise of worship , or obedience unto God , which springs from the measure of his own life , which must not be hindered , nor quenched by any law , power or pretence whatsoever . Therefore from the free spirit of life and liberty in Christ Jesus , this is proclaimed to the whole nation , and the nations round about , to take off their bondage , and to take away their reproach , which hath lain upon them for want of the life of Christ , which is now risen to do its own work , and perfect its own praise , and to deliver its own seed wheresoever it hath been in captivity , the power of life must deliver it , from all that which causeth shame and reproach , which is the iniquity and transgression of the life of Christ , which is the original cause of bondage to every nation , which the Lord hath promised to take away in one day , zac. 3. 9  And his work and power shall be known by its fruit , which is to take away their sin , esa. 27. 9  One great yoke of bondage which is upon the subjects and seed of God in this nation , and others , is , that ministry , which is not free , neither will minister without money , and the persons is not free to hear them , yet a yoke of bondage is laid upon them , to pay them ; and this iniquity is established by a law ; so here is neither free preaching , nor free hearing , unto which the free spirit raised up in this nation , declareth thus ; 

That every one that will minister , must do it freely , and as of the ability which God giveth him , and as the oracle of God , and that no profession of persons May maintain another's minister ; but that there May be a free preaching , and a free hearing among all persons , that so it May be a free nation , and they that will have teachers according to their own lusts and judgements , they to maintain them ; and that there May never any such iniquity be established by a law , as for one sort of persons to maintain another's minister , for this hath caused heartburnings , envy and strife , insomuch that little justice could be done for the nation , by reason of the cry of complainers and oppressors , as at every parliament , every high court , every assizes , and sessions , and petty courts , there hath some ( Pretended minister or other been presenting addresses , petitions or complaints , and so hath stopped the just and lawful proceedings of the affairs of the nation ; which interruption May easily be prevented , and the courts of justice freed from such brawling and unceaseable complaints , which hath been more interruption to justice , than any thing in the nation besides , and hath more hindered the people's deliverance from being a free persons , and a free nation , than any thing in the nation besides ; so let every form and profession of religion maintain their own minister , and maintain their own poor , which are crying at their meetinghouse doors , and in the streets , in the name of their God , for some relief , that so there May not be a beggar in England ; for herein the Christians in name , are become even a reproach among the heathens , to see their own flesh stand naked and uncovered in the streets , and steeplehouse doors , and at their doors , and they turn their ears from the poor , and forgets God , and loses the bowels of compassion , and are not merciful , as the father which is in heaven is merciful ; and so walks not according to the scriptures , but is a disgrace to religion , and even a reproach among the heathen ; so let no more the cry of the priests , nor of the poor be heard in our land ; the one crying for laws , to persecute and receive money of those , who they preach not unto , which receives no teaching from them ; which cry is intolerable , to be heard or suffered in a free commonwealth ; and the other for want of the creatures of God , when as others spend the creatures of God upon their lusts excessively , and so the creation is out of order ; but those that are come into the gospel ministration , and to be taught of the Lord , and have received Christ Jesus the Lord , and walk in him ; it is not so amongst us , for the creatures of God are not spent upon the lust , nor destroyed ; neither is there a beggar amongst us , who are truly of us , in the obedience of truth ; so that we do not desire that any persons or profession in the nation should maintain our poor , for they are our own flesh , without respect of persons ; for if any of us have of this world's good , & see our brother stand in need , & shuts up the bowels of compassion from him , the love of God doth not dwell in us ; neither doth any other maintain those that minister unto us the word and doctrine ; so we according to the royal law of liberty , desire to do unto others , as we would have them do unto us ; and thus to be a free persons and a free nation . So every form & profession will enjoy their own minister , till they come to know him , unto whom the gatherings of the persons must be , viz. Christ ; so that neither parliament , assizes , sessions nor courts will have any thing to do in matters of religion , but to keep the peace of the nation ; and then he that hath the word of God , May speak his word faithfully and freely , without interruption ; so that the gospel of God May have its free course , and be glorified . And that great oppression of tithes ( Which lies heavy upon the whole nation ) which God raised up his spirit in the army once to testify against , May be taken away , that what was then pretended May be now fulfilled , and the persons eased of their oppressions which they have long felt the burden of , and groaned under , that so ( As a free persons ) they May be delivered from that bondage , and the law May be disannulled by which that bondage is imposed upon them . So this will beget love in the nation , and all persecution , cruelty and bitterness will cease , and every one May freely and quietly enjoy the fruit of his own labour ; then with much freedom and cheerfulness , will every one minister of his substance unto all necessary uses , knowing that the earth and the fullness of it is the Lords ; and when this universal love and free spirit is begotten among persons , then will righteousness establish the nation ; and that will be brought forth , which many sincere hearts and tender consciences hath waited for , several years ; and many have been even almost weary and faint , in their minds , in waiting for that , which they once had a lively sight of , and hopes to enjoy , in the Lords promise of liberty and freedom opened in their understandings ten years since , insomuch that some have been ready to tempt God , and say , that he was slack concerning his promise ; and some , for want of long patience , hath left off expecting that which they once believed and hoped for ; but God is reviving the hopes of the contrite ones , and in them that had said , there was no hope in them , is he renewing strength , to believe that God will give judges as at the first , and councillors as at the beginning ; the judges at the first , were not to judge for gifts , nor for rewards ; nor the priests was not to preach for hire , nor the prophets were not to divine for money , but the judges did minister justice freely between man and man ; and the priests did minister the law freely , which was added upon all transgression ; so in those days here were no priests that troubled the courts , judges , nor councillors , with addresses , petitions , or complaints for maintenance ; no suing at the law , no imprisoning men's persons for wages , nor no spoiling of men's goods , and there was not such delays in executeing judgement upon transgressors as is now , for the judges sat in the gate , and executed judgement speedily upon the offender , & cleansed the land of evil doers , and so every one was to wait on his ministry , which he had received from the Lord , and are to do so now , if they do it unto the Lord ; he that judgeth for God , is not to respect any man's person in judgement , and he that hath the word of the kingdom is to minister it freely , and then the persons will minister their carnal things , freely , to every one that hath need ; so that , whereas even from the priest to the persons , all hath been given to covetousness , strife & debate ; every one now will be given to love and freeness one to another ; for he that hath spiritual things , will minister them freely , and he that hath carnal things , will minister them freely , and so will all come from under the execution of the law , and from all strife and contention . 

another great oppression , wherein iniquity is upheld by a law , is in the ministration of the law between man and man , it not being done freely , so not , as in the beginning . 

He that doth minister the law , let him do it freely for the Lord , and for righteousness sake ; and let him be as one of the judges in the beginning , and as one of the councillors , whose eyes were not blinded with gifts and rewards ; and so it will come to be a free nation , and then every man will not seek his own , but every one another's good , & then will pure love spring up to one another , & one will seek to preserve and save another , and not devour & destroy one another about earthly things as now they do ; so Christ's spirit will be found among all sorts of persons , ministers of the law , ministers of the gospel , and subjects of the nation , which were to save men's lives , not to destroy them ; and than the scriptures which cannot be broken will be fulfilled , and peace will be extended as a river , and righteousness as a mighty stream . 

For it is this spirit which i have mentioned , in lawyer & priests ( Which did ) not minister freely , but for covetous ends hath made merchandise of people's souls and estates , that hath broken the peace of this nation , as many hath had a deep experience , even when the army was in its first purity and zeal for God and his truth , that spirit did creep into their counsels and corrupted them , and did creep into parliaments , and corrupted them , and when there was any appearance of a monarchy , or government , arising in that nation , that spirit crept into every high court , and corrupted it , so that whole nations are corrupted with that spirit , so that till that spirit be purged out , there is not like to be a free nation , or a free persons , for it was that spirit which brought Israel into bondage , which was once a free nation , and not in bondage to any man , while the judges judged freely , and the priest preached freely , and the prophets prophesied freely without money , or without price ; then was Israel a free nation , and a free persons , and the glory of all nations ; but when the judges judged for gifts and rewards , and the priests preached for hire , and the prophets divined for money ; then they became as corrupt as the nations of the gentiles round about them , and then they came into bondage and captivity , and then profaneness went forth from the priests into all the earth , as it doth from those in England which are in the same state ; now see that sin and covetousness is a reproach to any persons , as Solomon saith , prov. 14. 23. and it is that which brings them into bondage from being a free persons ; now if none May minister the law , but those that do it freely , as unto the Lord , and as his ministers , than that covetous , self-seeking spirit will be purged out in judges , councillors , lawyers , attorneys , and solicitors , which would devour the creation , to spend upon their own lusts , that seeks for great places , to enrich themselves and destroy others , so that equity , law and justice is lost , and the free ministration of it in this nation ; so that in many cases , a man had better suffer himself to be defrauded , then to seek to the law for justice , the administration of it is become so corrupt , and the law is so perverted by them , that a man is not suffered to plead his own cause , but is forced to hire a lawyer , or an attorney ; and men are not suffered to bear a true and faithful witness , nor to have the truth and justness of their cause confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses , without swearing , and so persons is still kept in bondage by deceit and oppression from having the liberty of their pure consciences ; and so neither law , judges , nor councillors are now as at the beginning , nor such as ought to be in a free commonwealth . 

Now whereas in your late proceedings , it is ordered and granted , that every one shall have their free liberty ; first as an English man ; secondly , as a Christian , which liberty hitherto we have not enjoyed ; for as English men , we have not had our just liberty in the nation ; first , as concerning the law ; secondly , as concerning the worship of God ; for in this our own nation , and in our own counties , where we have been well known ( And also just and true , and of good report , and no evil justly laid to our charge ) have we been shamefully abused , whipped , stoned , prisoned , and both our bodies and goods spoilt , accounted as vagrants , and not permitted , as English men , to have the liberty of the law , because we , as Christians , could not transgress the commandment of Christ , which saith swear not at all ; so that if we May have our liberty as English men , than not to be persecuted in our own country as vagrants , where we are known to be no such persons ; and from hence let a true t••••mony , in yea or nay , be taken in our law without an oath , 〈◊〉 he that can take liberty to swear , and so to break Christ's c••mand , will take liberty to lie also . And secondly , if we 〈◊〉 enjoy our liberty as Christians ; then we are not to be force• 〈◊〉 a law to maintain the Anti-christian ministers , nor to be fo•… to swear contrary to Christ's command ; and also that act , 〈◊〉 law , is to be abolished , which is to persecute any for trave•… on the first day of the week , yea , when many of that day 〈◊〉 but traveled to the worship of God , hath been imprisoned , some their horses taken from them , & never yet had them ag•… and this is contrary to the Christians liberty , for the Chr••••ans , and the disciple of Christ , in the primitive time , tra•…led upon that day , and Christ himself traveled upon that 〈◊〉 as you May read in Luke 24. 15. where two of the disciple •…veled from Jerusalem to a village called Emaus , ( And 〈◊〉 being risen from the dead traveled with them ) which was 〈◊〉 Jerusalem about 60 furlongs , and that same day they trave•… back again from Emaus to Jerusalem , verse 33. which in 〈◊〉 is about 15 miles , and if they had traveled other 15 miles 〈◊〉 it was but the Christians liberty , and no law to the contr••• so let that be repealed , which binds and limits us from 〈◊〉 the Christians liberty , and from walking as they walked . 

And let not any magistrate be encouraged by you to •…ny cruelty or persecution , from his will , upon any for the •…ercise of their consciences in the fear of God , in obedie•… to his will ; for the day of your trial is come , and the 〈◊〉 which will make all things manifest , and every work of 〈◊〉 sort it is . 

An opportunity hath been put into the hands of many , to 〈◊〉 for God who had no heart to improve it , but hath impro•… their own interest for their own ambition , and God hath 〈◊〉 them as a reproach , and a byword among the persons , 〈◊〉 have sought their own , and not another's good , and have bused the power put into their hands ; therefore you that 〈◊〉 not yet lost your day , nor time , redeem it , least the Lord 〈◊〉 you by also , as not fit to do his work , as he hath done 〈◊〉 

The end .
