The epistle to the reader . 

Expect not that i should apologise or beg thy favour , either in buying , reading or approving the contents of the ensuing treatise . 

If in the publishing thereof i had had profit in my eye , than it would have been a necessary duty incumbent upon me , in order to my ends , to have fawned , flattered and baited my hook with , courteous , ingenuous reader , and the like ; but the bent of my spirit and intention carrying me another way , i have rather chose to play at hap hazard ; and although i May content none else , i am satisfied that i have pleased myself . 

I shall not give you an abstract thereof , or like one that would allure your liking , tell you more in the title and epistle than you 'll find in the book , there it is , let it speak for itself : possibly some May judge me peremptory , others fantastic , but for that i am armed , as neither seeking or valuing applause , or fearing or esteeming the contempt or malice of men . 

Let it suffice , it is the product of several years' experience , briefly , but truly according to the succession of councils and affairs related , and May serve as a clue to guide your memories ( Yea and judgments too ) unto a right understanding of those things which probably hitherto you have had but some confused notions of ; and they too so disordered , that thereby you have not been able to weigh things aright , so as to own or adhere to those principles of freedom and justice , in the attainment whereof your peace and prosperity principally consists . 

If i have been or shall be judged too severe or bitter in any expressions , in relation to persons or councils , i am sure it is so much against my principle , that if the nature of the thing could have been expressed in any other terms , and have retained the similitude , i should have forborn ; but although all truths ought not to be spoken , yet necessary ones must , and in many cases it is better not to speak at all , than not to the purpose . 

I have reason to believe that some will be angry , because probably they 'll judge themselves concerned : it is no news for the galled horse to kick , especially when he feels the smart , his sore being cauterised : but i have this advantage , wise men will not show it , and for such as are otherwise , their malice cannot prejudice . 

I will not tantalise you longer , but leave you to your liking , having no other end herein , than to manifest myself thine in the service of my country ,

the moderator : truly stating the case of the commonwealth , &c.  

I shall not look back so far as to the original of the government of Kings , whether before the conquest or since , nor dispute the equity or conveniency of the principles , upon which they were established ; although much hath and May be spoken for and against that form , both from principles of divinity and reason ; on the one hand the divine institution being pleaded , and not to be denied ; although on the other side , as to the manner of conveyance of , and investiture in the exercise of the office of kingship , it is alleged , that there can be no power vested in one man over many , but it must be either immediate or mediate : an immediate power given by God ( Say they ) none can claim ; if they can , let it appear and we will obey gladly ; but if not , than their power must be mediate : and if so , than it must have its birth either from force , because stronger , or consent and election : if by force , how long soever continue , freedom May be regained by the persons under that force , when ever opportunity serves : if by consent , than there is a mutual obligation , the one to govern by a law , the other to obey by a law , and this ( Say they ) is the most sure basis of government , whether it be exercised by one or many . the reason they give for this opinion ought also to be considered to prevent popular confusions . They say where the government of one or many is established by compact , there the persons do not convey a power to any to be exercised over them , according to the lust or will of the magistrate , neither do they bind themselves unto any servile or slavish obedience , unto his or their commands , and therefore they establish on their behalf trustees , not only to make and form the law and compact , by which they will be governed , but also to see that the same be duly performed on the part of the magistrate , without which , say they , it were a mockery , and not a government , each party obliged having upon principles of reason the same latitude of liberty to break the bond , whether of command or subjection . 

But my design driving me another way , i shall only take a short view of the state of the affairs and councils of this nation , under the government of the late King in the years 1636. 39 , 40.  And so proceed till after many revolutions , we come to find England as it were clothed with fears and buried in trouble and confusion as at this day , from the consideration of the causes whereof , the natural consequences will by all unbiased persons be readily deduced and applied . 

It May be remembered into what parties the ecclesiastical and civil counsels , under that unfortunate Prince were divided , viz. Arminian and Puritan , among the Bishops and clergy , French and Spanish , among the temporal Lords , each party seeming to be most active in advancement of the King's interest , while underhand they not only introduced , but also nourished and made their own designs to flourish . 

I need not mention the consequences of the counsels of those times , because the long intermission of parliaments , the excess of monopolies , even to pins and all things of necessary use , the many illegal and unwarrantable taxes of money upon the subject , as in the case of ship-money , which though but small in itself , yet in respect of the principle upon which it was demanded , ( Viz. a pretended necessity of which the King was sole judge ) by which the very propriety of every man's estate was and would have been destroyed . It being by the same rule as lawful for the supreme magistrate to demand twenty shillings or twenty pounds , if he see cause , out of every man's estate , as one penny or any other sum , because by the grand charter of England , and several other laws then in force , nothing ought to be levied upon the subject , but by and with the consent of the persons in parliament : i say these things are so fresh in memory , that i shall not need to stir those embers any further that have kindled such a fatal fire in the bowels of these divided and distracted nations . 

Only give me leave to mention the method that was observed by the Catholic cabal , then governing in council , to introduce those troubles , that have since been the necessary consequences of their then designments . 

As to the King , an unlimited prerogative was made the sugared bait to allure him to a countenance of , and compliance with them ; it being natural for all men ( Especially Princes ) not only to admire , but to reach at and covet the increase of power and dominion , especially when the attainment thereof seems to be facile , and the end advantageous . 

Having brought him to their bent in that particular , than they began to spring that mine which had for several years lain hide , viz. the introduction of popery , though not in its own name , nor with its own face , for as yet neither their councils nor forces were ripe for so great a work , and therefore the two factions Spanish and French , being joined to the Arminian part of the clergy , who at that time greatly overpowered those that were called Puritans , set on foot the orders for conformity and uniformity in public worship , and imposed the public liturgy or common prayer , setting the same above preaching , etc ▪ and this not out of any zeal to the glory of God , but in design to heat and perplex all such in the two nations of England and Scotland , as were conscientious , to the intent that by that opposition which must consequently be made by them , whose principles could not submit to those unwartantable innovations , an occasion Might be given them to incite the King to make use of his power by force to impose , what otherwise his proclamations and commands could not effect . And this from reason and experience , i allege to be the parent of the Scotch war , begun under the command of that great Spanish factor Arrundell , general , who indeed was the fittest to execute what had been so long hammering between him , his brother Cottington , and other the Cabalists of that faction . 

And by the way it is worth remembering , that while the King with all the power of the nation was engaged in the borders of Scotland , by force to subject them , to the designs both of his own and their enemies ; the Spaniard arrives in the downs with a powerful fleet and army , the coming whereof was never so much as known by England , or at least taken notice of until seen , although foreign preparations do and aught , generally occasion ( Nay necessitate ) domestic provisions for security : but the Dutch dissipating them , diverted the storm , and left England destitute of that proof of their design ; which if it had taken , we have cause to believe that pretended peace patched up with the Scots , had not been so soon made : but being put upon new counsels , and that foreign assistance failing , they feared to rely upon the strength of their army ; ( Which though as to men gallant and numerous , ) yet being somewhat divided , and all England behind them in fears , the appearance of the Spaniard as aforesaid having put men upon consideration ; lest the design should appear both to the King and his persons , i say a peace is patched up , the army disbanded , and a parliament called , by the expectation whereof the persons began a little to be quieted , in hopes that by those physicians the nation Might be cured of all its distempers . 

But such was the composition thereof , by reason of the prevalency of the court in point of elections of the Commons , and mixture of interests of the Lords spiritual and temporal , that as little could be rationally expected from them , as was effected by them at their meeting ; for as the intention of calling , was only to justify the Scotish war by a law , and to get money by a loan or subsidy to carry it on , to which the Commons would by no means assent , so all expectations became frustrate by their speedy dissolution , and the setting on foot new counsels and designs to increase the flame , and incite the King to make new levys against the Scots , imprison several members of the parliament , and Scotch commissioners sent and attending to ratify the treaty , seize several of the ships and goods of the Scotch , and by all means endeavour to suppress and destroy the Puritan party as they call them , who they judged the only great enemies to the King ; whereas they took the exactest course in the world to make them such , all their designs and actings being clothed by his power , and strengthened by his warrant and commission . 

And to the end the want of money Might not retard or hinder the vigorous prosecution of the war , the Bishops open their bags and rain showers of gold thereby justly giving occasion for it to be called , bellum episcopale ; but notwithstanding their haste , the Scots who suspected foul play , had form an army , and were upon their March into England , before they could raise and rendezvouz , and maugre their speed , after their routing of a party nigh Newborn , engaged by the Earl of Strafford , ( As is really believed ) upon design to make the war certain , the Scots enter Newcastle , and possess Durham and parts adjacent , while the King retires to York , neither army proceeding any further to acts of hostility . 

But by the way it is observable , the Earl of Northumberland , who a little before could not be suffered upon any terms to pass Trent , being popular in the North , and a moderate Protestant , must be made general , the better to colour the business ; and since the Spanish assistance failed , a new foreign force must be made use of , and the Catholic Irish , his majesties then pretended most loyal subjects must be armed , and engaged in this religious war , contrary to reason , common rules of prudence or safety , and the consequences whereof did soon after visibly appear in that horrid rebellion , which ended in the sorrow and ruin of the designers . 

The Scots being in England , and necessities increasing , many of the nobility and gentry were summoned to attend upon the King at York , where after mature consideration of the state of affairs , a parliament is agreed to be summoned , and writs issue out accordingly . 

The parliament being met , and an account being taken of the necessities and demands of the King , after many debates , the parliament resolve and declare , that unless they Might be secured to sit until the grievances of the persons were considered and redressed , they would grant no supplies , nor intermeddle with the Scotch war , but leave it as they found it , or to that purpose . This resolution was a bitter pill to the court , and hard of digestion , but yet necessity has no law , down it must , and therefore an antidote must be prepared and lie in readiness as a cure for this poison : for the case stands thus , if the parliament be not satisfied , than no supply ; there is an enemy in the land , and an army full of discontents for want of pay , the Bishops bags either being emptied or shut up : now if the parliament pass an act for so many subsidies , upon the confidence of their security ; then though the King continue them to sit by a law , yet May the army or a considerable part thereof be by money hired to break them up , upon pretence of necessity , first create and then pleaded : upon which resolution the King is won to pass that act so much pleaded , as matter of his justification and concessions to the parliament . but whether he did really know , or were privy to the after game that was to be played upon them , after they had granted their supplies , i shall forbear to censure ; only leave it to the judgement of the reader upon the consideration of subsequent transactions . 

But this is evident to the knowledge and experience of the author , that accordingly both by letters and commissions under the hand and seal of the King , many endeavours were used to engage the army to break up the parliament , the forementioned act for their continuance notwithstanding ; and upon discovery whereof , the parliament were constrained ( though by contracting great debts upon the public ) to undertake to satisfy the Scots , and to pay and disband that army to prevent the designs , that were hatched and carried on under their covert . And this i May call the first visible cause of the parliaments jealousy , that the King although he did seemingly comply with them , yet underhand did depend upon , and was guided by other counsels . 

It is not my business to give an account of the weekly proceeds of the parliament , only by general hints of things to lead you by a succession of some generals , unto the remembrance of such affairs as May be conducible unto the end proposed . 

The business of delinquents , especially the Earl of Strafford , and disposition of the militia , were the most considerable visible causes of difference between the King and parliament ; other things Might and did intervene , as additional fuel to increase that flame , which since hath scorched ( If not burned ) all on both sides that had a hand in the kindling of it : but probably busy instruments in each party , having designs retrograde to the grand end , which should have been peace and unity , viz. soldiers of fortune ; that desired to fish in troubled waters , and hoped to rise by others ruins , animating the court to extremes ; the greatest whereof was the illegal demand of the five members ; and others as busy to take that advantage , to abet the persons in petitioning with seeming violence for such things as could not but in that juncture of affairs create jealousies and fears in the King ; i say things being brought thus into a sudden hurry , and the persons which not many days before , upon his return from Scotland , had entertained him with acclamations of joy ; now declaiming against him upon pretence of the denial of justice : and being seduced by the forementioned counselors , he first sends the Queen for Holland , and afterward leaves the parliament ; and retires himself from place to place , till he arrived at York ; to whom the parliament sent an humble petition praying his return , and several members are commissioned to give his majesty satisfaction touching his demands : but the design for war was laid , although peace was pretended ; and a seeming necessity for his departure pleaded , upon pretence of tumults ; the parliament was a burden , and must be removed : and it is submitted to judgement whether the design of the Queens going to the spa , publish• long before any of these pretended tumults ; ( Which never appeared , until the erection of the guard of cavalry against Whitehall , to hinder the people's recourse to Westminster ; though with peaceable petitions , according to their just liberty : and his denial of justice upon Strafford , ) i say it is left to judgement , whether the bottom of the business of that voyage , was not to buy arms and engage orange and the Dutch , to grant their assistance towards the carrying on of the intended war , otherwise it is not probable that the jewels of the crown by her pawned , and the money employed for that purpose , would have been hazarded in such a voyage : but to proceed . 

To initiate the war , instead of returning to the parliament , although often petitioned to that purpose ; a guard must be raised for the security of his majesty's person , and accordingly is ; in the mean time several members of parliament , ( Whether through fear of the event , or hopes or promises of advantage ; or by what other allurements i shall not determine ) betrayed their trusts , left the parliament , and went to the King at York ; thereby not only giving countenance to those proceedings , but also much lessening the power of parliament . in the mean time commissions were issued underhand , for levys of men , in order to form an army against the parliament ; and provisions in hand for the erection of his standard at Nottingham , which was soon after put in execution : these preparations put the parliament upon new thoughts , and seeing neither messages nor petitions could prevail , and that there was a necessity laid upon them , either to betray the liberties of the persons , that had trusted them , and the laws of the nation , into the power of those evil counselors , who had as aforesaid abused and betrayed the King and kingdom into so many troubles ; or otherwise to cast themselves upon the affection of their trustees , and the justice of their cause ; and in defence thereof to raise an army , which they accordingly did , and put the same under the command of the Earl of Essex ; with commission only to defend their authority , and protect the persons as much as Might be from the force of the enemy . 

I shall not enumerate the various successes of the armies , being unwilling to renew the tears of the parents , widows and orphans ; made husbandless , fatherless and childless in that unhappy war ; only in respect of some subsequent transactions , i must give a hint or two of some remarkable passages , upon the basis whereof a great part of the succeeding narrative depends . 

The war being prosecuted with violence in all parts of the nation , an association of Essex and other counties was made , and a distinct army , raised under the command of the Earl of Manchester ; others were on foot in other parts , according to their respective necessities under Sir William Waller , &c.  But Manchesters' army being moulded for the most part of sober serious Christians , though of different judgements ; God was pleased signally to own them in their actings and successes , more than any other force employed at that time on the behalf of the parliament ; and particularly in that engagement at Marston-moore , and the siege of York : the defeat then given being the first considerable weakening that ever the King's party received . I confess there were joined in the said engagement the Scots , who had been called in to the parliaments assistance : but as to their merit in that engagement , except some few of the gentry , i think it will become me to be silent , the whole brunt of the day lying upon the forces of Fairfax and Manchester ; and indeed it May well be reputed a sharp engagement , seeing all the generals on both sides left the field , not knowing the success : in which days exercise , col : Cromwell , than Manchesters' lieutenant general , did eminently merit the praise of a prudent and valiant leader : not to derogate from those many others , in whose places respectively , they valiantly and faithfully discharged their duties . 

But by the way , give me leave to mention a passage that happened soon after that engagement ; during the second siege of York as i May call it : the success of that battle and daily expectation of the surrender of York , then despairing of relief ; put the army upon great expectation of a sudden alteration of affairs , either by a total conquest or speedy and effectual treaty ; whereupon the Earl of Manchester and l : g : Cromwell discoursing concerning the regulating the exorbitancy of the nobility ; l : general Cromwell hastily replied , that it would never be well with England , so long as the title of a Lord remained ; by which it Might have been judged , that such a principle of ambition as afterward manifested itself , had not lodged in his breast : but we see all is not gold that glisters , opportunity makes thieves ; and therefore it is not safe to trust the most specious pretences , if it May be avoided , for fear of the like danger . 

But as the parliament gained in the North , they lost in the West ; the different commands creating different interests , so that the work was not like to prosper , unless there was a new model ; upon which the gentleman last mentioned being a member of the house , and having gained to himself a considerable party , upon the repute he had of honesty and gallantry : he then seeming , ( And i really believe ) at that time was a great lover of , and encourager of godliness ; i say having gradually increased his interest , and yet being unwilling it should appear too considerable ; his design being not probably ripe for execution , a self-denying ordinance was introduced , ( I will not say by whom ; ) although the consequences thereof May and do speak handsomely to that purpopse : for that being passed , both Essex , Manchester ▪ Waller , and all the members of parliament , whether Lords or Commons , were out of command , and himself too . So that as to the face of things , no man could judge of any design in him , more than the public good : but things remaining in this posture , a general must be thought on , and accordingly Sir Thomas Fairfax , a gentleman of unquestionable integrity , and full fraught with gallantry ; ( But a person of a passive spirit as to counsels , ) was made general ; and the forces put under his conduct : who no sooner was upon a March , and drawing nigh to a possibility of engagement ; but he directs a letter to the parliament , therein desiring that lieutenant general Cromwell Might be sent to his assistance , upon which the house by a resolve empower him thereto ; for i never yet heard of any other commission : upon this he repairs to the army ; and in the quality of lieutenant general manages the affairs , and steers the counsels thereof , upon whom he had a mighty influence , as having been the instrument of many of their advancements ; so that in effect , what ever success attended that army , the major part of the honour returned to the lieutenant general ; besides the advantage by increase of interest and disposing of commands ; he countenancing and discountenancing whom he pleased , according as they were instruments fit to be employed in his then growing designs . 

I shall wave the various occurrences of the war , and look forward till we find the war ended ; and the King delivered by the Scots for a sum , ( Much exceeding the salary of Judas ; ) where remaining under an honourable restraint at Holmby , commissioners were sent to treat with him , upon an accommodation fit for the King to grant and the parliament to require ; but as heretofore , that treaty was rendered also successeless ; the reason thereof is not very obvious : yet if the probable conjectures of some that in other things have not been mistaken , May be believed , the King's obstinacy in that treaty , had its rise from some encouragement given him of the division of the army , then set on foot by a party that called themselves Presbyterian , at least seemed such , on pretence of the relief of Ireland ; whereas in truth there was nothing less in design , then to divide the army , and to draw off pretensively for Ireland ; such a party as they knew would join with them in their design against them , they called independents , and to disband the rest , and to bring in the King merely upon the settlement of a Presbyterian interest ; which though i cannot but judge some of them godly men , yet so far as they are rigidly acted , upon that principle of coercive power over men's consciences ; i think it would be madness to empower them by a law , who have a zeal but not according to knowledge ; and are led by a hot-brain party , some whereof are ministers ; who could not endure the exercise of that power in the episcopal clergy over themselves , but cried it down as Antichristian , & yet are ready to contest unto fire and faggot for the exercise of it over their brethren , every way as learned , pious , laborious and faithful as themselves ; though probably not so covetous , as to have two or three livings and lectures : but this by the way . The treaty was dissolved , and the army refused to disband or be divided , until they had their arrears secured , and saw the ends proposed by the parliament , as the fruit of all that blood , and treasure that had been exhausted in the war , in some measure answered to the persons , of which they were a part as Englishmen , as well as soldiers : the flame being thus kindled by the hotspurs of the house , Holis , Prinne and the rest ; major general Skippon and others more moderate must be employed to quench the fire ; and in the mean time a new design is set on foot to remove the King from Holmby to some place of security , and then in his name to declare against the army and their abettors in the house ; and by that means to bring all the fury of the wearied persons of the nation upon the soldiery , that had been in the hand of God , instruments of that peace they then enjoyed ; and had it not been wisely foreseen and prevented , the consequence thereof had been much worse , to several thousands of the godly persons of this nation , then either the Bishop's persecution , or former war ; i confess i must call the work good , though not the manner of it , nor event , to remove the King out of the hands of a party , that intended to monopolise his power , to the ruin of their brethren ; i think was not only fit , but of absolute necessity : but to deny the giving the command , and to call God publicly to witness a lie , as did the l. g. in parliament , as i have been informed ; i look upon it if true as the first rivulet that began to let in a deluge of miseries upon himself and family . But the King was removed , and the camp metamorphosed into a court , some of the then principal commanders learning to flatter sooner than they could to fight . 

How the King was courted as to the giving of honours , thereby endeavouring to render the advancement of four or five general officers , the price of the blood and treasure spent in the war ; several papers printed and published by some that were nicknamed levellers , and confirmed with the loss of their bloods as sure testimonies , May sufficiently evidence ; and for my part , i do really believe when the King lay at Causham , and was afterward upon his public and solemn engagement , not to do any thing that Might tend to the disturbance of the peace ; ( Besides his private promises to Whalley and others ) that the commanding part of the army , did really intend his re-establishment ; otherwise it would not have been pressed with such candour and zeal , by their addresses to the parliament ; neither would they ( Having petitioned the parliament , not to command them to bring the King nearer London , ) notwithstanding bring him to Hampton court ; and permit the Scots commissioners to have free access ; whereby the King became liable to the breach of his engagement , by giving commission to Hamilton to invade , and also thereby gave birth to all those following insurrections of Surrey , Kent , &c. set on foot by the royal Presbyterian sticklers , on purpose to give time by busying the army , for Hamilton to fall into the association ; which if effected , the consequences thereof May be easily judged . 

I need not mention the dispute between the parties , about the militia of London , nor the issue thereof ; since it produced no good on their part that contrived it : but the flight of some and imprisonment of others ; and the positive owning of that party of parliament that were opposers of that interest . Only it will be worthy consideration what method was then observed by o. c. who then managed all the affairs of the army in effect , and had as hazardous a game to play between the insurrecters & levellers as ever came to hand ▪ for the case thus stood , the King ( By whose restauration he expected the old honour challenged by the Cromwell's , as was then suggested ; and upon whose account he had exasperated his truest friends ) had left him in the midst of a divided army , fired with discontents , all ready to fall on him ; ( A considerable part of the parliament then sitting , being disobliged and angry ; as having some jealousies that he designed his own greatness ) to oppose the fury of a potent nation ; backed with the power of a rich and prevalent party in the kingdom ; besides the relics of royalty , that the sunbeams of his complacency and countenance , had also warmed and enlivened to give him new trouble . 

Seeing himself thus ensnared , if by the most real discovery of his sorrow and shame for his aberation and wandering he could unite a considerable part of the army to stand fixed , and disband or cashier the wilful , yet they must divide into the several parts of the nation ; where the appearance of enemies required their service : leave the King to the charge and care of the parliament , he dare not ; and to carry him with him in his Marches both troublesome and dangerous , therefore first the discontents of those called levellers , must be heightened , on purpose to give occasion of telling an officious , but false lie to the King to incite fear , viz. that the levellers intended his death by some sudden attempt , by which bait and the treachery of some of his own confidents , he was driled unto the isle of Wight ; whither colonel Hammond was sent to receive him ; yet all this while the parliament were kept in ignorance , and must be , it being not ripe for discovery till the issue of ware-rendezvouz was seen , and then just in the nick , as if the product of providence , news of the Kings being taken is promulged with much joy ; when he was never loose , but trapaned as they call a snare faster than ever . 

Having thus secured the King , the next work is to quiet the rebels , before the Scots could be ready to invade ; but the work proving of greater difficulty and length than was imagined , had not the goodness of God , assisting major general Lambert in his conduct , beyond expectation retarded their March : it had been impossible for the forces out of Wales , to have joined , or been in a condition to fight them ; much less give them such a total overthrow , as the success of that day did manifest . 

After the rout of Hamilton , and reducing of Colchester ; we are at leisure to consult future safety , and in order to that , both parties are at work ; the royal pretended presbyter , whose interest depends principally upon the King : they press on a treaty , and the other ( As they had reason ) find no ground to trust him , that had broke such a solemn engagement , and put the nation to so much hazard : besides the expense of blood and treasure , which at that juncture of time was a great aggravation ; so that now the scale is turned , and that party that formerly thought nothing the King offered satisfactory , are now willing to receive any thing : and the other party that formerly were willing to depend upon the King's personal engagement , will not now trust his oath , though ratified by a law , as knowing that Princes acted by policy , judge no obligation of force that thwart's their designed power or advantage . 

In the pursuance of these ends both party's act , the royal presbyters are at the old trade of petitions and engagements abroad , thereby to give countenance to their proceedings in parliament ; and being prevalent in the house , vote not only a treaty in the isle of Wight , but also without much ado , as if the matter were concluded by instruction , vote the King's concessions satisfactory ; when if what was offered at Uxbridge , upon those propositions , and at Holmby by the King personally were considered , it will appear that there was more reason for the acceptance of peace then , then now ; the case being much altered : but it is evident it was not their affection , but the necessity of their interest , that drew them to this change of opinion . 

The other party had no reason if they could avoid it , to suffer these proceeds ; the ratification whereof must needs concentre in their ruins . The consideration whereof made then , not only to consider the carriage of affairs by the King , who had left no means unattempted to destrey the parliament , and enslave the persons , and that in opposition to that design , the persons ( Being acted by them as their trustees ) had hazarded their lives , and spent their bloods and estates ; that therefore unless they would bring all the blood that had been shed upon their own heads , they ought in judgement and conscience , at least by a public trial of the King , to assert the public justice of the nation ; in opposition to that principle of being unaccountable save only to God : in pursuance whereof the treaty was dissolved , the King removed ; and soon after the heads of the said faction , that had so often attempted upon the parliament , as to breach of privilege ; endeavour to divide the army , underhand contrivances as to occasion the late insurrections ; of which several of them Might have been convict , if the more weighty affairs of the nation then on foot , had not constrained the parliament to wave their prosecution , and remain satisfied , in that the clogs , that made their chariot wheels go heavy , were removed . 

As to the results touching throwing down kingship , as dangerous and chargeable , peereship as useless , and for the trial of the King ; the records of parliament being extant , i shall omit to treat any further thereon , only i shall add this and submit it : whether seeing on all hands it is granted that the King , before he could do any regal act , did solemnly swear to rule according to the established law , and to grant such laws as the persons should choose ; whether i say the parliament , that were the most proper judges on that behalf , had not power by law to call him to account for the breach of the said oath ; especially seeing the breach of the said oath is without all manner of question . 

And whereas it is alleged by those who cannot deny the former , that although the King May be accountable to a parliament , as the proper judges of law , and the breaches of it ; yet it ought to be legal and free . as touching these objections , they shall be in due time answered , to the satisfaction of all those that are not wilfully blind : but i must proceed with my narrative . 

The King being tried and executed , whether by direction of parliament , or to gratify a particular design , concerns not me to dispute : however the waters that had been troubled , grew smooth and calm , and the parliament began to cure those sores that our many years troubles had occasioned . 

In particular , many public debts were satisfied , contracted upon the public faith , in the beginning of the war ; and increased by new securities in the progress thereof . In short , affairs were so managed by the prudent conduct of counsels , that not only Ireland ( Whither o. c. was sent general ) was in a competent measure reduced ; but also the foreign trade enlivened , and the most probable grounds of a sure peace laid , that outward appearances could warrantise ; and from impartial judgements it must be allowed that England could never have been so unhappy , as to have run these risgoes of change & hazard , had not the aforesaid parties , counsels and actings , been the principal designers and instruments therein ; but as their malice is implacable , so their endeavours are diligent and without intermission ; as the product whereof , the Scotch were encouraged to a treaty at Breda , with the elder son of the late King , ( Since crowned King of Scots , ) it being from old experience known , that they never durst attempt any thing of late times against this nation , without encouragement by , yea and silver contributions too from engl. they being a persons principald to gain , who ever lose ; and to make their design faster ▪ they made sure of the Lord Fairfax , who ( As was said before ) was a gentleman exceeding passive in counsels , though otherwise valiant and active ; it becomes not me to dispute the reasons of his dissatisfaction in some cases , what ever is not of faith is sin , let it now suffice , he refused to engage against the Scots , and thereby put the parliament to the necessity ; and sending for o. c. then general in Ireland , who had much ado to order his affairs there , so as to come timely to receive the power of general , notwithstanding many letters sent him on that behalf : but providence ordered that the parliaments idol should be their scourge , otherwise probably as able , as honest , i am sure as faithful and less dangerous , Might have had the conduct of that affair , and left him to the enjoyment of one , that by that means would not be contented with three : but he loved to be courted , that when time offered he Might twit the parliament with their necessity and his service . 

Into Scotland he Marches , and to give him his due , he underwent many hardships ; besides a dangerous fit of sickness , from which if God had been pleased in mercy to deliver him by death , i believe he had not been guilty of that perjury , blood and apostasy that afterward he contracted . 

Being recovered , and the aftergame ( Though not at Irish ) to be played in England , he having a man to enter , followed hard after and entered in season ; hit the blot at Wor•ester , and came off victor , returned to Westminster ; entered the quarters of the court , viz. the cockpit , where he played the game so cunningly , that wanting enemies abroad , he conquered his Masters at home ; and brought such an unparalleled force upon the parliament , as never any King of England , ( Though invested with a legal and regal authority ) durst attempt , and for the doing thereof in point of justification pleaded necessity ; alleging that they designed to perpetuate their power , whereas if i be not informed amiss , when dissolved , they were passing the act for successive representatives , and had dissolved themselves and given a period to that law for their continuance , within very few days afterwards . 

But such a dissolution could not suit with his aims : had they dissolved orderly , the power in the interval would have been legally in the council of state , and a necessity could not have been set on foot to call a convention of , ( I believe honest men ; ) but of interests and opinions as various as the colours in Joseph's coat , and as unlikely to cement in order to security , service or settlement , as tissue and broad ▪ clothe , which constantly fret and wear out one another . 

But the success of that convention was suitable to the design of their calling ; for though during their sitting , they did nothing of any considerable moment ; yet at their rise , a party of them gave the power into the hands of the general , who under colour thereof took upon himself the title of Lord protector , but exercised the power of a tyrant : all his ordinances imposed on the persons , being the mere products of his will , and form upon the great plea of necessity by him create . 

Should i ennumerate the manifold advantages that England did receive by his government , i fear this incredulous generation would not believe it , or at least would be distasted thereat ; i shall therefore only mention some few for public satisfaction . 

First , that honourable and advantageous peace made with Holland . 

Secondly , that glorious war made with Spain , ( England's fast friend in all the late troubles , ) by which the trade of England is more detrimented , then by all the wars we have had since 1638.  

Thirdly , that gallant expedition to Santa Domingo , whither was sent a considerable army upon two accounts , as is believed , the one to rid himself of some discontented officers , which he feared would obstruct his second design of kingship ; the other if the design took to render himself able by the expected treasure , to maintain a mercenary army , to subject the persons to his arbitrary commands , which he judged the more facile , in respect of the pretended ease he gave them in abatement of taxes ; which he did not so much out of affection to the persons , but to contract debts , and impose the payment thereof upon his pretended parliaments , thereby giving the persons not only an occasion of complaint ; but also by degrees eating out their affections to parliaments , and rendering the only means of their restauration to freedom , burdensome , if not irksome and insupportable . 

But because his great expectation in the Indies , proved but a golden dream , to save his credit the Spanish war must be prosecuted in Flanders , and in order thereto a peace is made with the French , an army is form and transported under the conduct of Sir John Reynolds , a new knight made by the protector , some say as a reward for his apostasy from , and treachery to the levellers at Burford ; of which if he were guil•y , the hand of providence , if not justice met with him and his comrade in their return from Flanders , where they were buried in the sea without triumph , or tears , other than their own , their loss being concealed as long as possible ; till the trumpet of fame proclaimed the certainty thereof , maugre all opopsition . 

I shall not take upon me to give any reason , why the success of this army should be different from the former , although if their principles be compared , it May give some little light thereto ; let it suffice that their uninterrupted success gained him much credit , and rendered him very considerable abroad , though not much loved at home ; his whole life being accompanied with plots and conspiracies , some whereof were real , although others 't is feared of his own contriving : but to proceed . 

Fourthly , his frequent imprisonment of the gentry and others , many whereof he had no other cause of exception against , then that they were faithful to their principles , and so could not comply with his ends , and therefore as to be feared , so to be secured , and that not only for months but years , to the ruin of themselves and families . 

Fifthly , his frequent mockeries of the persons in calling and dissolving parliaments , allowing them a face of freedom in point of election ; but afterwards winnowing the wheat from the chaff , leaving few or none to sit , but such whose interest or principles engaged them to employ their wits in the advancement of his aims ; they being but the journeymen to do the work , that was cut out by his cabinet junto , and as long as they acted in order to that end , they had good words and were feasted , but if they run counter , then old Harry with his dagger , i mean Oliver would clap his hand upon his sword or breast , and not only threaten but dissolve them ; of the truth whereof we had several examples . 

I need not mention that great juggle of the act for kingship , and his cunning denial of the title , ( Which was the only thing he gaped for , ) because he saw some eminent persons in his army , which though nearly related , did abominate his apostasy ; although by secret threats , and ingratiating promises , he did endeavour to allure them to a compliance with the actings of parliament , with whom it is believed he was really angry , because they accepted his answer , whereas he expected that they should have both passed and imposed that title upon him , and enabled him to plead necessity , as he did in assuming the protectorship . 

But i fear if i should mention any more of his good acts , i should either tire or offend the reader , and therefore i shall leave him to the obloquy that is due to a tyrant and usurper , and proceed to the short reign of his successor , who was a gentleman that had very few other faults , but that he was his son , and so unhappily became heir to the fruits of his father's rapines and oppression . 

Under whose government , the difference May easily be discerned betwixt the father and the son , the first governing the council , the second being governed by the council . 

One parliament was by him called , and not without necessity , for not only his right in point of his father's nomination to the protectorship was litigious and doubtful , but also the engagements under which he groaned , left upon him by his father , by reason of the arrears of the army and navy , and other public debts amounting to some million , engaged him to that course , notwithstanding which , such was the good husbandry , that as it is said many thousands of pounds were spent in a payment-like funeral , and in mourning bestowed on them that were able enough to buy it themselves , and had reason to do it , as having gotten by his life , and were like to be losers by his death . 

How the interests in that convention ( For i call them parliaments , for form-sake , not because i judge them legal ) their proceeds being but as of yesterday , and so fresh in memory , i shall forbear to examine , only by the consequences , you May discern the composition , for by the conjunction of the cavalier , royal presbyter , and new courtier , the commonwealth's party ( Notwithstanding they had almost all the wit and reason of the house on their sides , ) yet when it came to the vote right or wrong it was carried against them , and such counsels set on foot in order to the heightening the pretended , but not intended court ; and oppressing the good persons under the notion of Anabaptists , and sectaries , Quakers and the like , all men that were opposers of that interest , being charged with some capital character of distinction , thereby to render them marks of obloquy or subjects , of terror and discouragement . And in this , being strengthened with an assurance of the concessions of the protector , they were heightened to that confidence , that contrary to all reason or former precedent , they took upon them to impose upon the army , by denying them the liberty of meeting together to consult their affairs either as Englishmen , or soldiers , although but to petition ; the people's right whereto hath been so publicly asserted , and contested for by former parliaments . 

To mention these things , amongst others then in design , the effect whereof we have now seen , although then under covert , gave the army just cause , not only to consider the consequences of those counsels , with the dangers accrueing ; but also to look back to their former actings , counsels and engagements , and in order to the prevention of impending troubles , which if the parliament then sitting were continue , would not only be nourished , but receive countenance to the introduction of monarchy , and ruin of all such as had been the opposers thereof : and not only so , but a gap must have been opened to a bloody persecution of many thousands of the good persons of engl. under the notion of Anabaptists , seekers , Quakers and the like , many whereof though differing in judgement , are faithful to God and serviceable to the nation . I say these considerations amongst others induced them to press the protector to consent to their orderly dissolution , which at length he granted , and caused to be done by proclamation ; thereby putting at that present a check to the design which now hath manifested itself , and without all manner of question , had been on foot sooner by some months , had that power been continue . 

Being freed from that fear , they cast about for future security ; and in order thereto by a declaration invite the parliament , called by the King , chosen by the persons , and continue by a law , made in full and free parliament ; who in the day of England's greatest straits stood in the gap , and on whose counsels and actions so perfect an impress of the power , and owning of God was engraven in indelible characters ; i say calling to mind what foundations of justice , freedom and security to all persons , either fearing God or living peaceably , was by them laid in the settlement of a free-state without a King or house of peers , they not only invite them to the exercise of the power from which they were illegally forced by their late general , but also engage themselves to stand by them and defend them against their and the nations enemies . 

Upon their meeting or immediately after , the protectorship ceases , and all things are reduced as nigh as May be to the order they were in , when the force was put upon them . i shall not trouble the reader with a journal of their proceedings , since the press abounds with subjects of that nature ; only in respect i find much dissatisfaction upon the spirits of some persons that are otherwise well-affected , who scruple their right to the exercise of the supreme authority , and some such other frothy exceptions , i shall in a sober manner offer to consideration , the following particulars . 

1.  That this parliament was called by the King's writ , and freely chosen and sent up by the country , as their representatives and as such owned by the King . 

2.  Whereas it is objected that the death of the King did dissolve them , it is answered ; that it is true in all parliaments but this : and had not they been continue by an act , the death of the King had dissolved them also : but if the death of the King , could not repeal that statute which is undeniable , then is their power of sitting warranted by law , and in this case there is no interregnum , otherwise by the same rule upon the death of the King , all the laws of the land must lose their force , and the government divolve into its first Choas , which were madness for any man to imagine . 

3.  Whereas it is further alleged , that although they were continue by an act , yet they were then a full and free parliament , consisting of three estates , according to the ancient constitution of England , it is answered ; that the people's representatives , the Commons assembled in parliament , were the original authors and founders of that constitution pleaded for ; and as former parliaments had the liberty of establishing that form of government , which in that age Might to them seem good and convenient , or at least being under a force ( Notwithstanding many strugglings to obtain their freedoms , ) were necessitated to take what the tyrants would afford them ; ( The truth whereof the contentions between the Kings and persons in all ages , about the great charter of liberties , doth plainly demonstrate ; ) i say be it upon which side soever , the peoples now representative , have as good a power to alter the form then established , and to introduce a new one if by them deemed most suitable and advantageous , to the persons that entrusted them , as the former parliaments had to establish that ; otherwise the power of repeal of laws , though never so destructive to the persons is taken from them ; and they that upon the clearest principle of reason and law , are the most proper judges , are rendered but ciphers altogether useless and unnecessary . 

But as to the main part of the objection , the parliament consisted of three estates , viz. Lords spiritual , Lords temporal and Commons ; for in the constitution of our parliaments , i do wholly exclude the King , who is in the judgement of law deemed major singulis , sed minor universis , and so cannot be brought into balance with the parliament , who according to the practice of former ages before the conquest , ( To which governments the conquerors submitted ) parliaments were the great and only conciliators , by whose counsels the Kings were wholly directed ; they having only a power of advising with , but not of imposing upon the parliament , as to the election or repeal of laws , as by ancient records if examined will evidently appear , the late practice now pleaded as a principle , having by degrees been introduced and imposed on the persons ; and that which was a violation of their charter of liberties , only warranted by custom , against law . But now there are no Lords , and not half the number of Commons , that by the law is allowed to constitute an house . It is answered , that when the parliament was thus constituted and continue with one consent , they agreed in a public remonstrance , wherein they unanimously declared , not only what were the grievances of the nation , by reason of the misgovernment of the King and his evil council , but do also engage themselves to act as one man for the reformation of the abuses both in church and state ; and this i call the good old cause , at first owned and asserted by the parliament . 

In their endeavours to accomplish these ends , undertaken so solemnly and upon such serious grounds , they meet with many obstructions ; and the King endeavouring to protect delinquents , by forsaking the parliament and levying of war , many of the Lords and Commons that had espoused the said good cause , and in their judgments declared it to be so , basesly apostatised , and joined with the King against the parliament , of whom they were members , and with whom they had engaged for the obtaining a reformation ; and i hope if they were called by writ to sit at Westminster , without an adjournment of the whole , they could not upon any legal account set up a juncto at York or Oxford ; and in doing thereof , i hope it will not be denied , but that they justly forfeited their privilege as members , and brought themselves under the judgement of the parliament for such their treasonable desertion . and thus one part of your Lords and Commons , so much pleaded for , are rightfully divested of that authority . 

As to your Lords spiritual , they were those that had introduced those innovations in church-worship ; and in order to the supporting themselves therein , had set on foot the Scotch war ; and therefore when they saw the parliament endeavouring to strike at the root , and that they , as principal instruments in misleading the King , were like to feel the lash of the law ; they being backed by a part of the Lords temporal and Commons engaged in the same compact , make a protest against the proceedings of parliament , and for that unparalleled and treasonable breach of privilege are committed to the tower ; and as obstructers and hinderers of that good work of reformation , by a resolve of both houses are disabled to sit in parliament : neither did i ever hear or read that that exclusion was deemed illegal . 

The two houses being by this time much lessened in number , though not in power , they transacted together in the management of the war against the King and his evil council , & still in all their declarations , propositions and treaties insist upon the same cause , viz. the reformation of abuses both in church and state , and offer several suitable expedients for redress thereof . 

The war being ended , they that in the wilderness were united , being in Canaan in peace , began to divide , as to the manner of doing what both parties agreed convenient to be done . these divisions made the chariot-wheels go heavily , and what reason could not prevail in , faction must ; a corrupt party , as aforesaid , in both houses endeavouring , for by-ends , to prevaricate , and after all the blood and treasure spent to obtain the forementioned ends , they endeavour to bring in the King merely to gratify their own particular interests , wholly waving the public cause so much before contended for : and in order to the accomplishment of the said end , because they could not obtain it by vote , they bring a force upon the parliament , and necessitate the speaker and other the members of the house , that opposed their proceedings , to fly to the army for protection ; and not only so , but in all their future actings and debates in the house , endeavour to divide the army , and introduce the King by a clandestine treaty , set on foot in the isle of Wight ▪ after Hamiltons invasion by the King's commission , whereby he had not only rendered himself an implacable enemy , but also a person not to be trusted , having made and broke such solemn engagements , to the hazard of the nations peace , and great expense of blood and treasure , thereby justly engaging both parliament and army to a resolution of proceeding against him according to justice ; which being for the reasons aforesaid opposed by the said corrupt royal party , and all their actings being diametrically opposite to the peace of the nation and privilege of parliament , they were kept out by a party of the army appointed for that purpose , and that exclusion confirmed by the parliament , who certainly are the judges of their own members , and May exclude as many or whom they please , if any just cause appear to them for so doing . 

And as to the five or six Lords remaining in the upper house , who , it 's from good reason believed , had never stayed with the parliament so long , if they had judged their interest as considerable on the King's party . If either the principles upon which they were established , viz. the will of the King , or their frequent actings , not only to balance but overtop the interest of the persons in their representatives , by denial to pass many other good laws proposed by parliament , as well as the act against kingship , but also their challenging and exercising an arbitrary jurisdiction over the lives and liberties of commoners , over whom by law they had no power or cognizance , even to the subversion of that government , by the which they pretended to stand as peers : i say , if these things be considered , it cannot be denied to be as legal an act as ever the parliament did , when they voted them useless and unnecessary , and reduced the power to its first principle , viz. to the supreme authority the persons , in their representatives the parliament ; neither can it by reason or law be alleged , that all or any these mutations , changes and interruptions should take away or destroy their legal power , if there remained but two and forty , although it be evident that there remaineth a far greater number , and such too , as in all the nations troubles have been most eminent for piety , integrity and stability , in principles tending to freedom and security . 

I Might hereto add the signal blessing of God upon all their councils and actings , in so much , that not one weapon form , or design set on foot against them , hath prospered ; but they have had cause of rejoicing , while their enemies have been ashamed . 

But i find another objection , and that is newly sprung up , viz. that they were not only dissolved by their general , but submitted to the power of the protector , owned and acted under the government as members in his parliaments , as they call them , and as justices of the peace , and the like , and therefore their power of sitting as a parliament must needs cease . to which i answer , that their servant Might and did by force interrupt them , but could not dissolve them , because he had not power to repeal that law made for their continuance ; and it is worth observance , how he and his complices were infatuated , in that in all his conventions ( In some of which he had power enough ) he never attempted the repeal of that statute , which , although such a repeal could not have been legal , yet it would have given some colour to this objection ▪ but the law being continue , they could not be legally dissolved . And as to the other part of the objection , it is fit to distinguish between generals and individuals . i do believe that some particular members Might and did act under his power , as John or Thomas , &c. but not as a parliament ; the actions of one , or some few , not being to be applied to the whole . I confess , had the parliament , as now constituted of such and so many members , acted in order to the support of his tyranny , or submitted to his authority , by transacting with him , the case had been clear ; but their actings as individuals , while under a force , and that being upon principles of necessity , submitted to , only to gain an opportunity to struggle for recovery of their freedom ; i would fain know upon what principles of law or reason this can be judged a dissolution ; but it 's no news for discontented persons to create cavils , and then disperse them as material principles of reason ; whereas if they were but duly considered , they would appear to be but vain Chymira's , vented on purpose to occasion disputes , and foment troubles and divisions . 

But the former is backed by another considerable plea against this power , and that 's the increase of taxes ; and this seems to make an exceeding great noise , catches every ear , & furnishes discourse for every busy tongue , that otherwise would be at a loss for news to tell in a tavern or alehouse . 

As to the increase of taxes you May thank your selves and not the parliament : for pray remember in what condition you were , when they had that force put upon them , as to peace , trade at home , and credit abroad , nothing lying upon you but an ordinary tax and moderate excise ; and yet then as certain a charge lay upon the state , in respect of the Dutch war , ( Powerful navies being exceeding chargeable ) as ever the late powers could pretend to ; and yet still some public debts were paid , as well as the armies and navies ; so that in a short time England had probable hopes of great ease , as to an abatement of their taxes , especially if an as honourable and advantageous peace had been made with the Dutch , as this power proposed & insisted on , and for denial whereof they undertook that war . But if you remember further , there hath been a Spanish war , set on foot without the consent of parliament , and therein not only many men's lives lost , but much treasure hath been expended ; and not only so , but vast debts at home , and arrears abroad , contracted and owing both to the armies and navies , besides the charge of a court ( For the inferior part of it ) more luxurious than the Kings : by all which means great debts now lie upon the parliament , although you know what an exceeding great increase of excise was granted by one of his conventions , to the discouragement ( If not ruin ) of trade : now , i say , this was England's , nay , give me leave to speak it to the shame of many , it was even the fault of those , who had most reason to assert the parliamentary interest , had not we repined , and like ignorant children eagerly desired a change , in expectation of better things , we had not in this manner met with worse : neither had the general , though his army had been united to him , ( Which we know for the generality were surprised ) dared to have attempted their dissolution , or his own usurpation ; but we , like a company of weathercocks , are now so frenchified , that every new single-fangle takes us , and we are more ready to run with our flattering addresses to them that forge strong chains for our heels , ( I Might say , hearts ) than those that endeavour to recover and secure our freedoms . i need not mention the present occasion , the charge is visible in your eyes . Now pray how shall these debts be paid ? the decay of trade , which you all experience and complain of , renders the revenue of the customs and excise very inconsiderable , and what other incomes May happen is uncertain ; you see there be enemies at home , and you have reason to suspect foes from abroad ; besides the visible necessity of a considerable strength , to balance the discontents of honest men , who , as the case stands , are hardly to be trusted with the keeping of their own peace : now , i say , upon all these considerations , how can you charge the parliament ? you would have a protector , and still strive for a King ; nothing but a single person will please you : and yet although you lay all these foundations to contract debts , you are loathe to have any hand in the payment : but soft and fair , self do , self have ; if you will have Princes you must maintain them , and if your discontents endanger the peace , it is a necessary duty , incumbent upon the parliament , to keep an army to prevent you . Englishmen are almost turned Bedlamites , and , were not the lash threatened , harmony would be turned to discord , Cain would slay poor Abel , and all parties , like Samson and the Philistines , would die together , though probably their expectations May be otherwise . 

I know , to serious men i have said enough , as to this subject , and for self-willed persons all that can be said is too little , because they are wedded to their own fancies . Discontented persons desire no satisfaction , and malignant ones deserve none . I shall therefore proceed to offer some few queries to the consideration of all parties , that take themselves to be concerned in the peace and prosperity of England , and submit all to the consideration of the unprejudiced reader . 

1.  Whether it be by any rational man supposed , that the Kings of England , as single persons , had their power and magistracy by the immediate designation of God ? 

2.  Whether ( If not by God's immediate appointment ) it was not attained by force or fraud , or conferred upon them by mutual compact and agreement for society and safety sake ? 

3.  Whether ( If so conferred ) the persons conferring was not the supreme authority ? 

4.  Whether it can , upon any principles of reason , be imagined , that the persons , thus sensible of the benefit of society , and in order thereto making choice of such a form of command and subjection , did not also by some equal rules balance the power , to prevent tyranny in their King , and slavery to them and their posterities ? 

5.  Whether ( If the power were attained by force or fraud , although for a time the persons for necessity sake do submit ) May they not throw off that yoke , and recover their freedoms if by any means they can ? 

6.  Whether , in case of compact , the King taking upon him the government , upon condition of performance , and that upon oath solemnly taken in the presence of the persons , he shall notwithstanding act according to will and not law , thereby rendering that which was intended for the common good , a common mischief ; i say , whether in this case the persons are tied up to a slavish , servile obedience , and left without all manner of remedy , either of divesting him of that authority , or of calling him to an account , or judging him by the said compact and agreement ; and if so , upon what principles of reason or prudence could they submit to such a slavery ? 

7.  Whether , if the persons May call their King or supreme magistrate to an account , they May not elect another , or choose and establish any other form of government , to them appearing most conducible to their safety ? 

8.  Whether any government be more likely to answer the great ends of the persons , than when their laws are made by their representatives equally elected and limited , as to the exercise of that power , so that he that commands this year shall taste of subjection the next , and therefore will be careful how he entails slavery upon himself and posterity ; the law binding all alike , and not saying , thou shalt not kill but i May , but whosoever sheddeth man's blood , by man shall his blood be shed ; and so in all other cases ? 

9  Whether the present parliament be not the most likely persons to establish a government upon the most equal principles of freedom , that have so frequently declared for it , so zealously contested against tyranny , even unto the blood of the tyrant , and remain so solemnly engaged to God and man , both by their own declarations , promises and principles , according to the best of their judgments to accomplish it , and that as a testimony of their thankfulness for the eminent deliverances that God hath given them in their endeavours to obtain it ? 

10.  Whether the discontents of the persons , and endeavouring to bring in a family , that , it is to be feared , God hath set his face against for evil , May not only provoke God to deal with England as with Israel of old , and give them a King in his wrath , but also bring a judgement of war upon this nation , with the miseries accrueing ; and then , when it is too late , men will wish for that peace , which now is so irksome and troublesome ? 

11.  Whether , if the present parliament had a desire ( As is pretended ) to perpetuate their power , the hair-brained actions of the generality of the present generation , doth not treat a real occasion , it not being safe to trust unskilful riders with such wild asses ? 

12.  Whether , ( If notwithstanding ) the present parliament , through the blessing of God , shall attain the desired end of peace and freedom by the settlement of successive representatives , and make due provision for the equal distribution of justice , and having established this nation upon a sure basis or form of government , as a commonwealth , shall in some convenient time dissolve themselves ; whether , i say , most persons in England will not have just cause to take shame to themselves for the slanders , reproaches , interruptions and hard thoughts they have harboured against their faithful patriots , who , maugre all difficulties , have been supported in their spirits to prosecute their work , resting upon the righteous judgement of God , and not valuing the threats or tumultuary disturbances of contrary-minded men ? 

My friends pardon my plainness , i do not speak from a principle purchased by reward : that which sways with me to assert the forementioned premises , is , a real knowledge of many of the gentlemen , and of their aim in the general ; and if the unbelief of England make not their chariot wheels heavy , i am confident that God will make them as great instruments of good to this nation , as they have been examples of wonder and astonishment to their enemies abroad and at home . but if by jealousies , murmurings and repinings , plots , insurrections and rebellions , men will not only interrupt them in their work , but also necessitate them to act upon principles of safety and severity , i refer it to all rational persons , whether it be likely that they should ever be able to answer those ends ▪ which you so much desire , and yet by all crooked endeavours hinder ? how can you expect peace when you design war ? how can you expect ease from your burdens , while you create a necessity , rather of increase of an army than of lessening it . Certainly , if men would but consider former experiences , and eye what different methods God hath observed in bringing about his great and unparalleled dispensations in these nations , contrary to all the designs or expectations of men ; i say , certainly were these things soberly considered , it would teach men patiently to wait in hope for the good they expect in God's own way , and not take upon them to prescribe how , and in what manner , or by what instruments it is conveyed . his arm is not shortened , why then should any man despair of attaining his desires ? is it not because he will confine God to such and such means ; and without it be done in such a way , it is presently concluded it cannot be done ? whereas both experience and late examples manifest , that God hath transformed the hearts and judgments , and turned the designs of the great men of the world topsy-turvy , beyond all expectation , as in the very case of the present parliament ; and without doubt , when ever they shall cease from designing his glory and the public good , or render themselves unfit instruments for the work which he is doing in the world , then , and not till then , shall their counsels fail , and they shall be shattered and cast away as useless and unprofitable servants ; others , better fitted , shall be raised in their stead , ( For God hath a succession of providences , and all his councils are ordered and sure ) therefore wait patiently , and you shall see the salvations of the Lord . 

Lambeth , August 30. 1659.  this is the assured hope and expectation of him that desires to manifest himself ( Friendly reader ) thine in the advancement of his country's peace , J. h.  

A postscript to the parliament and council . 

Right honourable , 

Having in the foregoing narrative taken the boldness to treat of you , give me leave now in plainness of heart to speak a few words to you . I confess you May justly demand , how dares such a poor , despicable , obscure creature , as i am , presume to paraphrase of , or dictate to you , that are the Princes of our little world . i know by sad experience it many times falls out , that integrity is accounted arrogancy and singularity ; flattery better pleases the ears of great men than plain dealing , but i hope better from the greatest part of you ; however i have not learned to flatter , nor know how to fear , therefore my reward is with that God that knows the bent of my spirit , and will in the latter end bear testimony , that what i have done herein proceeds from a principle of affection , not only to your persons , but to the public interest concentred in you . 

Those travellers that fear dangers or desire safety in their journeys , use diligence in their inquiries , and receive direction with thankfulness ; but if an unknown or unthought-of danger be discovered unasked , that doubles the obligation , and 't is not an unusual thing in long and dangerous travels ( Especially where enemies are on all hands ) for such occasions to offer themselves . 

It is an old but true proverb , standards by see more sometimes than they that play ; and the reason is obvious , high conceit doth usually occasion oversight , and we are apt to discern other men's mistakes then our own : self-opinion and self-love are two of the most dangerous steers ▪ men that can possibly be employed at the helm ; and if captain humility look not carefully to the compass ▪ 't is ten to one but the ship will either be split upon the rock of ambition , or swallowed up in the quicksand of oppression . 

That you have a difficult ( I May say dangerous ) journey to go , as being encompassed with enemies abroad , ( I wish i could not say at home too ) besides the clogs and remoras occasioned by domestic divisions , flowing from the difference of interest and principles , i think will not be disputed or denied ; i Might to the difficulty and danger add the distance , for if ever you arrive at your journey's end , as you have set out from the wilderness of tyranny and slavery , so you must never cease till you have attained the desired Canaan of justice and freedom . you know it is said , that none obtain the prize but they that run to the end of the race , and truly i May say to you in the same sense , that it will not be sufficient for you to bring England to the borders , or within the sight of the enjoyment of those promised ends , you have so frequently declared for , and they have so earnestly desired ; unless God shall deal with you as with Moses of old , and for your transgressions suffer you only to see the land a far off , but you must with Joshua , conduct the persons into the possession of your promises and their hopes , maugre all opposition . And though there be many Corah's that create fears and disparage the work , both as to the matter and manner of it , yet be not discouraged , but proceed ; and consider , that if the work was good when you first declared for and undertook it , although the way to the attainment be strewed with briars and thorn , yet certainly the end will be crowned with peace , glory and joy unspeakable . 

But what do i speak of the wilderness when you have already entered into Canaan ? the yoke of Pharaoh is broken , and we are under a solemn tie and engagement never more to return to Egypt , then in your March beware of the gibeonites . there be many , that because they cannot conquer , will flatter , and cry peace , peace : many will ( And do ) walk your ways with other intentions , i beg of them therefore to beware of such covenant-mongers , for fear ( Instead of freedom ) you entail slavery , or , at least , thrust an incurable thorn into the sides of your and our posterities . 

I shall not take upon me to point out the persons , that merit this appellation ; but i say , you May know them by their fruits , unless thistles do ( In this strange age , of strange productions ) bear figs. i shall therefore proceed to present a few things to your view , and humbly submit myself and them , to your serious consideration . 

1.  That great engagements do not only occasion great expectations , but also create answerable obligations , both toward God and man . 

Now give me leave to appeal to you , and beg of you to consider , whether ever a generation of men in power as you now are , lay under , or stood obliged to such , and so many solid , serious , reiterated , religious and civil engagements , as you are and remain at this day ; and if so , what need have you to take heed to your standing ! and as that noble heathen , who had his remembrancer every night to put him in mind that he must die , so you , to recount your declarations and engagements , to the end not one of them be broken , so far as they are consistent with the glory of God , and good of this persons , with the government of whom you are entrusted . 

2.  Consider , that great mercies require suitable returns ; that you have been partakers of infinite mercies inward and outward , i hope the greatest part of you experience , now pray what is a more suitable fruit of mercy received , then to manifest mercy to others ? I am sure , forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive others that trespass against us , is the best argument that our saviour hath left us to make use of , when we beg forgiveness of God ; and if so , i cannot but judge it to be the best rule of our proceedings , and much better than an eye for an eye , or a tooth for a tooth . i speak not this to indulge or indemnify traitors or disturbers ; but i offer it as an expedient in order to moderation , summum jus est summa injuria , there is a vast difference between justum and justa ; as too much security May endanger safety , so too much severity May by degrees introduce slavery , the consequence whereof is an equal , ( If not a greater and more incurable ) mischief . 

3.  That afflictions like the sun either harden or soften , make better or worse . God hath for your own and England's sins , for several years past , judged you in the presence of the persons ; and for my part i do not doubt , but under the sense thereof you have secretly and solemnly humbled yourselves before the Lord , acknowledged your wanderings and waywardness ; and not only so , but have made your vows and taken up resolutions , that if ever you were restored , you would do what ever your hands found to do with all your might , without dallying , denial or delay : and i really believe your late ( I May say ) miraculous ( I am sure unexpected ) restauration hath been the fruit , if not of yours , of many of the good persons of this nations prayers , who mourned over , and longed for you , as instruments by whom they expected deliverance from their threatened spiritual , and then inflicted temporal enthralments ; now upon this consideration , judge seriously both your work and your way . 

Your work is to relieve the oppressed , and to let the bound go free . 

I Might here enlarge , but in short , all oppressive laws , whether relating to the consciences , persons or estates of men ; all oppressive rules used in courts of judicature , all oppressive exactions of bailiffs , gaolers and prison-keepers , as to matters of debt and the like , aught with speed to be prevented and removed , as being ulcers that will suddenly occasion the whole body to gangreen ; and give me leave by the way to hint one thing that in a more special and immediate manner concerns your inspection : it is suggested very frequently , that there are exceeding great exactions used by some of your inferior officers , entrusted with the custody of your prisoners of war ; which if true , renders your very mercy as mere cruelty as May be , i do not charge it ; and i know if any such thing be , it is both against your principles and former practice , and i am sure it is contrary to equity or the present interest ; many are prisoners that probably deserve more , and i believe others that merit not so much ; however though all are and aught to be subject to the law so far as guilty , yet none ought to be slaves to the will of their keepers , further than in order to their sure keeping : and whatever authority May be pleaded , the great exaction of fees , and the monopolising of their bellies and purses , by denying the supply of provisions from any but themselves , and that sold too at a dear rate ; i say , ( If it be true , ) it is a great dishonour to the state , a punishable crime in the keepers , and a positive oppression to the prisoners ; and would be worthy your speedy inquisition , to the end your honour , and the public justice May be vindicated . 

Having heard great complaints to that purpose , i have thought it my duty in this way to inform your honours , and if it be possible to shame them out of such by paths ; all that is so gotten being but like a moth , that will devour and eat up the honest profit that Might be got by their employments ; but probably the thought of the gain will vanquish the shame , and if so , a just punishment seasonably inflicted , May work that repentance which friendly admonition could not accomplish . 

As to those declared foundations of freedom , upon which a sure basis of government is to be settled , i shall not take upon me to intermeddle , not doubting but the wisdom and interest of parliament is such , that as they will on the one hand take care to curb & restrain licentious profaneness and oppression , so on the other hand , those that are pious and peaceable , though of what opinion soever , not contradicting the written revealed word , nor opposing the fundamental principles of religion , May and shall receive protection and encouragement , and not be left to the fury of fanatics ; and in so doing you will bring much glory to God , good to his persons in these nations , and lasting honour to your selves and posterities ; which is the daily prayer of , 

Right honourable ; Your faithful servant , John Harris . 

Finis .
