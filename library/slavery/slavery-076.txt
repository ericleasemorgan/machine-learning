Being the whole progress of the adversaries long , and continue plots , briefly laid open , and discovered ; whereby the archest malignant will be either convinced , or condemned , and the weakest of the well-affected sufficiently strengthened and encouraged with all vigour to proceed with the parliament in the defence of religion and liberty .

Britannicus his pill to cure malignancy . 

I will begin with his majesty's reign , a strange wife is prepared , which according to the scripture is a dangerous preparative for a strange God , surely they will turn their hearts after their gods , 1 kin. 11. 2.  This groundwork being laid , they endeavour to persuade the King by fraud and subtlety to bring in popery and slavery , for the effecting whereof , observe first the design of the bringing in the German horse , the billiting of soldiers , the frequent and untimely breaking and disolving parliaments , setting before his majesty the example of France and his broken parliaments in full power as an object of emulation : then the Bishops and their episcopal creatures have publicly preached , and in their discourse and writing endeavoured to maintain that opinion and argument , that all we have is the Kings , and he ought to do what he pleaseth ; as if God made all the world for a few Kings , and not for the persons , and persuaded him that parliaments and Puritans were his majesty's chiefest enemies : moreover look what endeavours have been used by the Bishops to cheat us of our religion by degrees and pauses ; to set up popery at one time would have made too great a noise , but with a gentle hand , and to do it so as it Might steal upon us insensibly , and should devour us , but we should neither know nor see ; to have suspended all orthodox preachers at once , that would have been too conspicuous , but by degrees ; first to suspend all lectures , as an order of vagrants not to be tolerated in the church . next forbid all pastors preaching in their own churches in week days : then inhibit preaching on the Lord's day in the afternoon , under pretence of advance of catechis•e ; soon after forbid all praying but in the words of the canon . after this the communion table must be railed in ; soon after it must be set in altar posture , then all must be compelled to come and kneel before it or not receive the sacrament , than it must be cried up as sanctum sanctorum , and that all men's faces must be towards it in prayer : secondly to press the examples and practices of some as a great means to bring on the rest , to dazzle the eyes of the less judicious persons of the kingdom , as my Lord Archbishop , or Bishop bow versus altare , the Lords of the must honourable order of the garter at their instalment bow towards the altar , his majesty's chapel is thus and thus adorned : thirdly an edict for recreation up on the Lord's day is procured , and it must be read by the ministers : fourthly to cast all out of the ministry that will not be punctual and full conformistss to the old ceremonies , fiftly injoining a farthel of new and unheard of ceremonies and injunctions : sixtly prayers must be made and proclamations read against our brethren the Scots : lastly the new and unparelled oath for episcopacy : thus you see how by degrees , stratagems and engines they endeavoured to work out those arch-heriticks as they called all good and godly ministers out of the ministry , as it was sometimes said to Eliah . 1 Kings 19 him that escapeth the sword of Hazaell , shall Jehu slay , and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu , shall Elisha slay ; so had they said , him that escapeth the dint of the ceremonies , shall the book of sports slay , and him that escapeth the book of sports , shall the proclamations slay , and him that escapeth the proclamations , shall the oath slay : the chiefest and greatest fomenters and promoters of these s•cessive stratagems we all know , neither can any malignants or atheists deny but the late Earl of Strafford and the Archbishop of Canterbury were the two great engines of this work , and what manner of favorites both of them were at court , and what interests they had in his majesty and the Queen is apparent enough , and by the events it doth too notoriously appear : the Archbishop was he that held correspondency with Rome , as by several letters May appear , and to whom the Cardinal's cap from Rome was sent , and he that endeavoured to be papa alterius orbis , this is he that altered the oath to be taken by the King at his coronation , and endeavoured to overthrow and annihilate magna charta , and to bring in tyranny and popery , as by these and several other articles which are proved against him in the house of peers , by which his design is sufficiently apparent what he intended , for which it is hoped he shall receive suddenly his just reward . 

Since these private designs was discovered , and the war against the Scots became frustrate , than broke out the Irish in rebellion , who are now esteemed his majesty's best and faithful subjects ; although it is apparent that the Irish nation , bears not only an inveterat hatred to the British nation and our religion , but even to the very beasts and plants of the English by their cruel torments and massacres of two hundred thousand Protestant's , and the wastes and spoils made upon the English plants and cattle , as by several depositions taken upon oath doth , and May appear ; and in their general discourse , they say they have , and had the King's commission for what they have done , or do , and the horses , or other cattle they took away from the Protestant's there , they marked with the Queen's mark , and usually called themselves the Queen's soldiers : you May remember the oath they have taken , with all their power to uphold and maintain the free exercise of the Roman Catholic faith and religion , and to obey and ratify all the orders and decrees made , and to be made by the supreme council of the confederate Catholics : you May likewise take notice that thousands of proclamations and declarations , how speedily and quickly they were read against the Scots , but when the Irish rebellion broke out first , it was a long time , near two months before any proclamation could be obtained against them , though often pressed and desired by the parliament , and when obtained , the printer of the proclamation by special command must print but forty , such favour , such countenance had that barbarous and most horrid rebellion : remember also general Munro writ , that about a year since the Earl of Antrim being going over out of England into Ireland , was taken at sea , and about him was found several papours and instructions , whereby it doth plainly appear ( As he writes ) that the design was to root out , and wholly extirpate the Protestant religion in all the three kingdoms of England , Scotland , and Ireland , since which time the Earl of Antrim escaped , and is now preferred to be a great officer in Ireland , and since made a marquis : moreover the generals of the Irish forces in Ulster did offer to my Lord Munro the parliaments general there , to appeal to the King , which of them had the truest commission , and which his majesty would aver to be his best and most faithful subjects , and according to such his majesty's determinations , to quit or hold their employment , if my Lord Munro would promise the same , to stand to such his majesty's determination : and further , none can deny but the Irish papists commissioners were the persons extraordinarily favoured & countenanced at their late being at Oxford , and their bloody and unheard of cruelties passed over with a painted peace , and seeming cessation , and the Protestant commissioners then there also at the same time , were slighted and neglected ; will not this , and many other passages make it clear , that the war was raised here in England , to hinder this kingdom from sending any supplies of men , money , arms , and ammunition into Ireland , against the Irish rebels : then consider the Kings coming to the parliament ( As supposed by the Queen's persuasion ) to accuse the five members of high treason , was not here the great and most dangerous beginning of these wars in this nation , which if the five members had been delivered up , you May soon conjecture what acts of parliament would have passed even the next day , to the greater slavery and misery of this nation , then by the thoughts of man can be imagined , but by the providence of God they were protected by the worthy citizens of this famous city of London , and we hope will be protected by each other , until their foes be subdued unto them . 

Next the Kings going to York to raise a guard to defend his person , than his going to see hull , the great magazine of the kingdom : then the Queen she pretends to go over into Holland to see her daughter , when indeed she intended nothing more than to bring over arms and ammunition , though it were with the sale of the crown jewels . besides his majesty tells you at first , no Papist must come nigh his person , and were exempted out of the warrants for putting the commission of array in execution : but soon after they were allowed to buy arms for their defence , contrary to the known laws of the land , and were then desired to send their horses , and his majesty would set Protestant riders upon them , and now behold who more employed in places of trust , and countenanced by honours and preferments , and esteemed his best subjects , kept for reserves in most dangerous assaults and employments , and whose counsels at court more prevalent , predominant , and over ruling then the Papists , and Irish rebels , who work together , with , and for the Spanish faction in that court . 

See how active the Queen is for promoting her cause , and what power and interests she hath with his majesty , and his counsels , which cannot be expressed in words , and what dependence she hath to Rome , and all the priests and Jesuits both in foreign nations , and in England , consider also what motives and prayers have been made amongst all the Roman Catholicss all over Christendom , for the good success of the King's armies , also i could go backe and tell you of the poisonning of marquis Hamilton , &c. the Popes Nuntioes' residing here , and if Windebanke and others of their orders , and warrants in favour of priests and Jesuits , and also their intended massacre against the chiefest pillars of Scotland , the marquis of Argile , the Earl of Lowden , and Earl of Leven and many others when the King was in Scotland , the very same day the rebellion in Ireland broke forth . 

Consider also the subtle engagements of divers of the children of the palatinate in this war against the parliament and kingdom , a design of the Jesuits , fetched from hell , to make an inveterate hatred in this kingdom to that family , thereby if it were possible , to take away all hopes of ever recovering the palatinate again for the right owners . 

Look upon the persons that side with the King in this war , if not for the most part , almost generally Papists , Bishops , and their adherents , monopolizers , delinquents to the state , beggarly gentry of this kingdom , and of the better sort of nobles , and gentlemen , terrified and frighted with the lion's skin , and foxes cunning , some gained with terror , others with hope of honour , and preferment ; this hath much increased that party amongst the gentry , and none but know that his majesty's storehouse of common soldiers , he raiseth from the dark corners of the land , where ignorance , blindness , and libertinism is prdominant and a pious godly ministry very scarcely to be heard of , where the Lord's day is known by a few common prayers in the morning , and by dancing , drinking , and rioting about a maypole in the afternoon . 

I have now traced and touched upon some of the heads of those abuses and false pretences , and black engines which our enemies have wrought withal to cozen , and cheat us of our religion , and liberties , and any understanding man by this discourse May easily discern popery , and slavery was intended : and now courteous reader , since so many stratagems and traps have been laid to ensnare thy conscience , and to bereave thee of thy religion and liberty , and fully laid open by the blessing of God , in this fixed parliament , who have laboured well nigh four years against mountains of dangers and difficulties , and have also cased you of many burdens of shipmoney , high commission court , monopolizers , and have set thee at liberty from the iron yoke of Bishops , and their hierarchy , and dependants , and are striving , and wrestling to settle the in thee true Protestant religion , in the purity thereof , to be governed by laws , and not by horses , and garrisons , as in other nations : nor according to the fancy , and will of the Prince or his favourite , and also endeavouring to save three kingdoms from a dying , and sad condition they are now in , which will best appear , and be discerned when the present wars is over , when we shall enjoy what we now so much contend for : therefore my advice is , that every man that loves his religion or liberty , to use his utmost , in their prayers , in their purses , and persons , to uphold the spirits of such as faithfully stand for theirs , and the kingdoms good , to their calling in parliament , though some of their members be turned apostates , and rotten , being tossed , and shaken away , with the anger of the King , or enticed away by preferments , or such like vanities ; are these things worth the religion and liberty of the nation ? In a word i dare boldly say , that man which doth not cordially uphold , and defend parliaments in times of try all , doth as much as in him lies , to destroy the same , and then i appeal to every man's conscience ; if in destroying parliaments , thou dost not as much , as in thou liest , destroy religion and liberty of the kingdom , which God grant we May never live to see .
