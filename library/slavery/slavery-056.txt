News from Sally : of a strange delivery of four English captives from the slavery of the Turks . 

About the beginning of October last , four English ships , the one from Rye , the other from Bastable , the third from apsum , and the fourth from Dartmouth , being bound homeward from Rochel , after a day and a night's sail , it was their fortune to meet with a Turkish man of war of Sally , who being well provided , with small resistance took them ( They being merchants men and not for service ) carried them to Sally , where after some few day's arrival , one of each ship was sold to a merchant of Argier for slaves , who having not opportunity of passage remained some days in Sally with his slaves , in which time he gave order that shackles should be made for each slave weighing fifty pound weight , but the Lord most graciously delivered them after this manner ; viz. for being chained every night ( As the custom is ) to an iron bar until their shackles were made , and in the day time employed about the town , they found means to speak with a Portugal slave concerning their escape , who assured them that if they could conveniently get out of the town , they Might take their course along the sea shore , and in three or four hours they May recover a town of the Spaniards , not distant from that place above eighteen miles ; which having learn , tthey employ their best endeavours for their escape , so that having gotten a piece of clay , and finding opportunity to make the impression of the key of their prison in the aforesaid clay , by which they made a wooden key , and making trial found that it would stand them in stead ; the night before they should have departed for Argier , and that their shackles should have been put on , having got a strong nail , they begun about twelve a clock to tamper with the lock which held the chain to the iron bar , to which they were fastened ; but having spent two hours , and not being able to pick the lock , despairing of their purpose , laid themselves down to sleep : but God putting into the heart of James Cadman ( Master of that ship from Rye ) once more to assay the lock , rose up , and being next unto the lock , at the very first trial opened it ; which having done , opened the door with the wooden key ; then coming to another door , they easily lifted it off from the hooks with an iron bar which they there found ; so likewise a third door , which lead them into the street . But mark the wonderful works of the Lord , for all the time that this was a doing , a dog continue barking in the house , which their patron and another Turk never heard , although they lay the very next wall unto them . So being come into the street , the one having the iron bar , the other an axe , the third a staff , and the fourth an iron ladle ( Such as they melt lead in ) they run presently to the town wall , and leapt down without any harm , it being eighteen foot high , and so took their way towards the shore , not meeting with any scouts or watch in all the way . After which , as the Portugal directed them , they run along the seashore , in far more danger of the wild beasts ( Which use to haunt those places ) than formerly they were of the Turk their Master ; but God which delivered them out of the hands of the one , saved them also from the jaws of the other : for they met but with one wild bore , who so soon as he had set eye on them , fled from them . They did hear in divers places the barking of a small beast , which usually follows the lions , by which they guessed divers lions were thereabout , but met with none . So with running , by break of day they obtained the Spanish town , where the governor gave them noble entertainment , and within the space of an hour , took them into a turret , where he showed them 24 Turkish horsemen , which had pursued them , but God be praised , they were out of their reach . The iron bar , the axe , and the ladle , the governor hanged up in the chief church of the town , in memorial of their strange delivery . So having occasion of passage for Cales , they came away from thence , and finding a Dover ship at Cales , came for England , where they now are to give God praise for their safe delivery .
