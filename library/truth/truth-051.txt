An account from the children of light , ( To them that asks ) in several particulars , why we have been kept from joining to , or worshipping in , those forms at law , and forms of worships , that have been imposed upon us against our consciences , in these late years , for denying whereof , we have so deeply suffered , with our lives , liberties , and estates . 

Also what we own , as to those things , and can be obedient to for conscience sake , according to truth , and the practice of the church of Christ , and the scriptures . 

for our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience ; that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , 2 cor. 1.12 . 



London ; printed for Thomas Simmons , at the bull and mouth near Aldersgate . 1660.  

For as much as many have desired to know the ground in particulars , of our differences in faith and worship towards God , and in some things as to the outward forms at law , which men have sought to impose upon us in these late years ; and also what we would desire therein ; therefore is this written following , towards the satisfying of every honest desire , who loves the kingdom of Christ . 

There is no kingdom nor persons can truly be said to be the Lords and his Christ's , but as they come to be guided and governed by the law of his spirit in their consciences , which spirit and anointing all must wait for , even from the King that sits on high , to the least place of government in any persons , that with it all May know judgement , and to do justice , which is of God , and not of men , that he May be known , to be the anointing of Kings , and to judge among the judges , whose right it is of old , and God hath given it to him by an everlasting generation , even after the power and order of an endless life , that in him and in his seed May nations and kingdoms be blessed with peace , even through and in his righteous government ; for God the father accepts neither persons , laws , nor governments , how prudently soever they be made , if they be not in him , and from him , and for him ; because for him , was made all souls that move , not only in earth , but in heaven also ; all signs , and seasons , types and shadows , worship and Sabbath was made for him the son of man , and no flesh breathing , nor spirits neither , men or angels hath any true power or right , but as they receive it in him , and so use it to him , and for him , over any of these things visible or invisible , to rule , force , or order , no not over his own body , but by usurpation ; and for the time that he , or they , shall hold that power , and not in him , as aforesaid , they shall be under the curse of God , not established in peace and righteousness , but in tyranny and oppression ; with force , or with flattery , must such rule in their day , until their measure of time , and sin , be fulfilled , in which the vengeance of the almighty shall remove them far away , only their names shall remain as a curse to those that come after . Thus God will plead the cause of his own seed , and overturn , and shake nations and kingdoms , until the earth know that the heavens must reign , and the stout of heart confess that the head of every man is Christ , and that God hath made this same Jesus ( Which men hath rejected ) both Lord & Christ , which in his time he shall show to be the only potentate , King of Kings , and Lord of Lords , who only hath immortality dwelling in the light , where he sits at the right hand of power till God shall make all his foes his footstool . 

Now this is that we wait for in every appearance and face of authority that comes up , to wit , the face of Jesus our righteous King and saviour , in whom is no violence , nor oppression , who when he comes to rule , we know will be tender of the tender in conscience , and meek towards the poor in spirit , and with righteousness will he judge , and rule on the earth , to deliver the helpless from him that is too hard for him , who will drive wickedness from his throne , and the workers thereof into a corner , but will gently deal towards all that travails with righteousness , and put the lambs of truth in his bosom , for he loves righteousness , and hates iniquity , therefore hath God called him his anointed , and will give him the heathen for his possession , and a priest to God he is to all generations , in his days shall the upright rejoice , for he shall walk safely in his uprightness ; no net shall then be spread on the mountains , neither shall he that turns from iniquity be made a prey , for under him shall every one serve his god without fear , in holiness of life , and godliness of conversation . 

Now this is he we wait for , even the beloved of our souls , and we know his birth is come to the nations , and his morning towards the persons , yea to the wise in heart , who are yet afar off , hath his star appeared ; and we know his breaking forth to these lands as the bright sun after the stormy rain , even so shall he be after the shakeings , he shall be a covert from the tempest , as rivers of waters in a dry place , and as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land , even so shall he be , who shall reign in righteousness , and by whom Princes shall rule in judgement ; this is the royal seed , and he that is of him is the son of nobles , his Princes eat in due season , for strength , and not for drunkenness ; thus shall the land be blessed , who is found worthy to receive the anointed of God to rule in its borders . 

And this is he whom we have preached to all the several governments that hath risen ever since God revealed him in us , and the glory and peace of his kingdom ; and we have patiently waited , and in great sufferings hath our souls traveled , to see if by any means , we Might see , any worthy to receive his anointing , and to be born of his spirit , to govern by his power , and with his counsel to order , and be ordered , that through him they Might be established of God , and we have looked through the vail of flesh in all sorts of persons , and could not bow thereto , and by many contrary spirits have we been evil entreated , because we could not own •hem , for him , whose kingdom we seek , in rulers , teachers and persons . 

And thus have we gone seeking the righteous one , through parliaments and protectors ( So called ) priests and rulers , of all sorts , but his government we have not found , nor with his righteous judgements have we been judged among them , but we have been shamefully entreated for his sake , and have born his reproach , because of his spirit in us , and his kingdom in our consciences ; and many times have been tried to the loss of estates , and lives , to see if they could provoke or drive us from his faith in our consciences , or tempt us any way to deny him , and own them in their wills ; and though we have daily suffered thus under every several power , and persons , yet have we not ceased to warn them in love , with much fear and plainness , that if by any means they Might have received his testimony , and not have perished in their gain saying ; for our god in whom we trusted showed it to us , that they should not prosper , nor be established without him , his spirit , and anointing , to whom he hath given the government of all persons , that shall be blessed by him , yea , all the nations , of them that are saved must walk in his light , and receive his counsel , for their stability , and his resurrection for their glory , and his anointing for the strength of their kingdoms . 

And this is the cause why we have chused rather to suffer under every power that yet hath risen , then to join in with them , because we have not heard the voice of the holy one in the midst of them , neither hath his spirit in them been the strength of their counsels , but they have sought to make flesh their arm , and to strengthen their kingdom with flattery and deceit , and not with truth , and they have sought to make themselves dreadful by violence , and to rule with cruelty , and not with the sword of God , which is judgement and justice ; and have sought honour from men , and not from the Lord , and their covering hath been vain glory , and not the spirit of God ; so with the light of Christ we saw their foundation , and their building , and that they could not stand long in God's sight , and that all that joined to them must fall with them , and that the woes that are written of such must certainly overtake them 

And this is the cause , and no other thing why we have hitherto born our testimony against them all , even because they would not join to the Lord , nor hear his voice in their day , but the more he called after them by the mouth of his servants , the more they were •ardned , and the more provoked him to their own confusion ; so it hath not been prejudice to any man's person that hath kept us at a distance from them or their commands , for we can truly say we have waited without prejudice , if by any means we could but have seen any of them seeking the kingdom of God , that therein they Might have been established , yea we have the witness of truth in us to this day , how glad our souls have been before the Lord , when we have but felt the least tenderness in any of them , arising •rom the spirit of Jesus , or the least confession from his light in them . 

And sometimes we have felt some tenderness in some of them when they have been low , little , and in fear , in which we have had some hope and gladness to hear the voice of simplicity and truth , ( Though but brokenly ) so that we could then have said they was not for from the kingdom of God ; but turning away the ear from the spirit of truth in them , and consulting with fleshly wisdom and carnal reason likely to make wise , and to accomplish their self-ends , how soon hath truth fallen in them , and blindness , and hardness of heart come over them again worse than before , which being showed us of God , we could not but deny them also to be of God . 

Thus in general , an account is given to you that asks a reason , why we have not yet owned any power that yet hath risen , so as to join to them in all things . Now to you who desire to know in what particulars we have differed from these governments that yet hath risen since we was a persons ; we Might say our lives , practices , and sufferings hath openly declared it , through the most parts of these nations , and in most , and greatest of our differences ; yet for the better satisfying of some that knows not so much as others , and to take away all occasion of offence , from all that would not oppose the way of truth if they knew it , and to leave without excuse the wilfully ignorant , and persecutors of the good old way of Christ ; i shall instance in some things , and also show our warrant for so doing , both by scripture , and the practice of the holy men of God , in their generation ; it being that so many are yet ignorant and unbelieving , concerning the present leadings of the spirit of truth in them , which is chief leader , and corner stone in us , by which we walk towards God , and towards men , in all these things . 

And as to that first . Though God hath laid it upon us as matter of conscience , to be subject to what outward government or governors soever he shall set up over us , in outward things ; and also that with all willingness of mind a ready subjection be rendered , at every just command , not for fear only , but even for conscience sake ; and that in all things , we should seek the safety , and honour , and well-being of such governors , to the utmost of our power , even as we look to account to God for it , of whom the powers that be , are ordained ; yet hath he begotten us unto himself alone , and to the leadings of his own spirit in all things concerning faith and worship , as to matter , manner , time and place ; this is to be done and performed singly as to him , in the leadings of Jesus , and in the power of his spirit alone , else will he have no regard thereto ; and for this purpose hath he given the spirit of his son into our hearts , to be our light and understanding and leader in all these things ; to which leadings and movings the father requires obedience in all things , upon eternal condemnation in matters pertaining to our consciences ; that must be the throne of Christ alone , and there will he sway the sceptre of eternal life , and answer his persons in all things , and be their saviour , guide , and lawgiver , in all things that are just and holy . 

So that is at any time their teachers have left the way of life , and would l•ad persons after them , yet hath he through faith and a tender conscience , preserved a seed out of error to himself in such a day , by which he hath reproved and made manifest the folly of such teachers ; and to this the scriptures do fully testify , as in the days of the prophets , when they erred in vision , and had not the word in them , and so caused the persons to err through their lies , and through their lightness , then had he men of enlightened consciences , to send to reprove their brutishness , though otherwise they themselves was neither prophets nor sons of prophets , but May be , a herdsman , or a gatherer of siccomore fruit , a ploughman , or a shepherd , or some such , which England's pride would call mecannick fellows , yet in these was the seed preserved , else the land Might have become as Sodom , and not one have known the Lord nor his word . And as it was in the days of the false prophets , so hath it been since the days of the false ministry , for which many have suffered since the days of the apostles , for testifying against such as have erred in spirit , form , and doctrine , from Christ Jesus and his apostles ; and this hath been from the indwelling power of Christ in them , and his precious light shining in their hearts and consciences , that they have thus been preserved , and enabled , to bear the testimony of Christ against false worships , and worshippers ; and so it is at this day , in all who keep a pure conscience towards God in all his word and worship , that his true , and spiritual worship Might not be wholly lost out of the world . 

Also if at any time their Kings or rulers forgot God , or Kings arose who knew not God , and then would lay upon them laws and commands , which was not just an• lawful for them to do , than by the light of Christ in a pure conscience they was enabled to withstand it even unto death ; as that of Mordecai and the Jews , who would rather all be destroyed then bow to Hamon's pride at the King's command , though England's persons would have said this is but a civil thing , and duty , and good manners , and the like , yet God's law in their conscience they preferred above all that the King commanded contrary thereto , yea life and all would they lose rather than defile their conscience towards God , or deny his law there , though no law without had forbidden such a thing ; yet in other cases did they appear true and subject to the King , for Mordecai's truth saved the King's life , not long before , though from man he had little reward for it . 

Likewise Might be instanced , that of Daniels praying contrary to the decrees of the King , his counsel of precedents and Princes , and that of the three children against the fierce command of Nabuchadnezzar , in denying to worship at his will and pleasure ; likewise that of the apostles , when their rulers and priests also , charged them straitly not to preach any more , their answer before authority was , we ought to obey God rather than men ; yea it would be too long to tell how many godly men and women , upon the account of a pure conscience , not only hazarded their lives , but lost life and all , for the testimony of a tender conscience , as Might be instanced . But this May be said for all ; that if they would but have denied the law of God in their conscience , and conformed to the wills of men , and their laws , not o•e of all the prophets , apostles , or all the holy men of God need to have suffered death or spoil . 

So now in that any of us by the same spirit of Christ , and from his light and law in our consciences , are moved to go testify against false prophets , false worships , and declare the way of truth to all persons against them to their face ; and if rulers have been so opposite to this as to make laws against it , and to command us to bow and worship at their wills , which for conscience sake towards God we could not , for which we have suffered the spoiling of goods , long and heavy imprisonments , shameful usings , and loss of lives also ; i say in this we have a cloud of witnesses , even the Lord Jesus our captain , and the whole body of martyrs , who have all gone before us in the self same obedience of faith and spirit , and have suffered the same or such like things from rulers that knew not God , and teachers that knew not God , in their days ; and all of them in their days was Counted offenders , heretics ▪ or despisers of authority or some such reproach was cast upon them by their accusers and persecutors , for obeying the law of their god in their consciences , whom the rulers of the darkness of this world have not known , nor can know , till they believe his light in their own consciences . 

So it is not for new things , nor strange opinions , which was never in the world before , for which we suffer , ( Though to the world they seem new and strange , but for the very same works , of the same spirit of light and truth , which hath often appeared in a poor contemptible persons , and hath as often received the same measure , from them who profess him in words ▪ but in works deny him ; by such have we suffered , who read and preach the same in words , which this eternal spirit in us now worketh ; and with such who with words garnish the sepulchres of those whom their fathers slew , are we Counted great offenders , for being found in the same way and practise , and in obedience to the same spirit , in that measure as we have received it ; so we have this added to the testimony of a good conscience towards God , and towards men , that we suffer not for evil doing , though as evil doers ( To wit ) the practice of holy men , and the scriptures of truth which will own us herein , and stand on our parts against all our adversaries and accusers . And t•is will be proved so when we come to particulars , wherein we differ from the ways and worships of these present times , and for which we are so much hated and persecuted . 

And we know that it will not be found harmful to the bodies , estates , or well-being of any Christian neighbourhood , nor of any other persons in the nations , to practise those things wherein we differ , in civil and temporal things , nor hurtful to the souls of any . In the things wherein we differ in religious or spiritual matters , from the several opinions and forms of worships that are or have been set up in these nations ; as we shall make it plainly appear if either spirit of truth ▪ or scripture of truth or things equal May but be received on our part . Now we shall mention some particulars in which we differ for conscience sake from some of the forms traditions , and commands of the men of this present age , and the powers that have ruled therein ▪ under whom we have therefore suffered , as evil doers . 

And first as to those things which some calls civil . 

And indeed it May be wondered at , by any moderate persons , that in a nation called Christians , any man should suffer , so much as to be called an offender for some of the things which i must mention upon this account , especially they being laid upon us by the spirit of Christ as matter of conscience , and by a persons so highly pretending for liberty of conscience . 

As it hath been laid upon us by the spirit of Christ , to use the same single language to all sorts of persons , which the scriptures uses , and all the holy men of God therein have ever used , that is to say , thou to any one person , and you to more than one ; a language , sound , and true , to God , and man , which the spirit of God first spoke , and gave to man , and of man received it again without offence , and never since gave to man any other form of speech , as we May read in the scriptures of truth ; and in this we differ from some sorts of persons , and for it have •uffered as great offenders , and have undergone very grievous censures , and long imprisonments , divers of us , though it hath been laid on our consciences from the Lord , yea the scriptures also , commands the form of sound words , to be holden fast ; now why those who profess the scriptures for their rule , should persecute us for using the language of it , May be thought strange to the hearers thereof ; yet for this we suffer for a testimony against them . 

Also it hath been laid upon us by the Lord to call men and women by their own names , which their fathers have given to them , to be known by amongst men ; and though in this we differ from some sorts of persons , who can give flattering titles to some persons in stead of their names , and reproachfully miscall others in stead of their names , yet herein we are owned by the scriptures of truth , and the practice of all the holy men therein , who never refused their own names to take a proud title , but owned their names that God had given them , and saith the scriptures , let me not give flattering titles to man , for in so doing my maker would soon take me away . And if you respect persons , you commit sin , and are convinced of the law as evil doers ; yet for this we have suffered also by this generation , as evil doers , and contemners of authority , though we know that to call a man by his name , contemns not his authority , nor do we it for that end , but in obedience to truth , and for conscience towards God . 

Also that about our hats putting off , which hath been so great an offence to many ; this also hath been laid upon our consciences by the Lord and we dare not disobey him therein to please men , though sometimes it hath been said to us that if we would but put off our hats , we should not go to prison ; others have said , when we came before them for judgement and justice , you shall have no justice , unless you put off your hats ; yea some have hazarded their lives hereon , yet durst not disobey God herein , though they have suffered long therefore ; and lost their rights for want of justice : yet we have not dared to disobey our god herein , but have valued our peace with him and a pure conscience above all sufferings and profits herein . Now , this is beyond all the persecutors of old , that men should suffer for their hats , yea , even Nabuchadnezzar in his greatest heat of persecution ▪ he made not that an offence , to keep on their hats , more than their other garments ▪ but with their hats on as well as hose and shoes , they was bound and cast into the fire ; nor do we find in all the scriptures precept or practice of that thing yet for this we have deeply suffered ▪ in divers parts of this nation . Thus would persons and powers , drive us from the obedience of our God , in a pure conscience ▪ and instead thereof cause us to worship a vain custom , for which we have no warrant , neither in scripture ▪ nor good example , but saith the Lord , ye shall keep mine ordinances , but the customs of the persons are vain , and abominable , you shall not defile yourselves therewith . so , we obey God rather than men ▪ and by men who professes God , suffer for so doing . 

This also hath been commanded us of the Lord , and laid upon our consciences , not to swear at •ll , upon any occasion whatsoever , and because of this we have forborn to swear , when men have called us thereto , whether to swear at any change of government , or what ever it hath been , we May not swear at all ; and for this we have deeply suffered also , as contemners of the law , though we have not despised government , but have consented to what just thing was required of us , in truth of heart , without swearing ; and for this we have the express command of Christ Jesus who hath said , swear not at all ; and his apostles said , above all things my brethren , swear not , least you fall into condemnation . and we have also the practice of all the followers of Christ who was never known to use an oath since ; for to such as receive Christ there is the end of swearing ; and divers other things which before Christ came to end them , was ordinances of God , but Christ the covenant everlasting hath ended all swearings of men whatsoever , and forbidden they are in his name , upon pain of condemnation . Further , in the time of Moses , when swearing was in the Jews church , it was not to be forced upon them by any penalty , but they Might swear or not swear , without any carnal punishment , nor was it required of witnesses to swear at all , betwixt a man and his neighbour , two witnesses was to establish the matter before the judge , but i never read of those two required to swear , that was as to a man's own particular , only in this case , when a man had taken a pledge , and it was stolen from him , than an oath was to be taken of that man in his own behalf , that he put not his hand to the stealing of it , and then he was not to repay it again , but if he would repay it he needed not swear , so he was not forced . And except in this case only , i find not an oath required by any judge in Moses law . So , these who make us offenders , •or denying to swear , are out of all the way of God in Moses time . And in Christ's time , swearing is expressly forbidden at all , even this in Moses time ; for faith Christ it hath been said by them of old time , thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thy oaths . so here was Moses time , and swearing to the Lord , commanded in truth ; and this said Moses . but ( Saith Christ ) i say ▪ swear not at all , and this is greater than Moses , whose time is without end . 

Further , as to the administration of the laws of these nations in these late years , there we have seen many things , which in our conscience we cannot join to , being showed to us to be out of truth , and equity , and not helps , but burdens to the nations ; now as to ourselves , so many as walk in Christ Jesus , we have one judge , and lawgiver appointed to us for that end by the father ; and we May not go to law one with another , as men being come to Christ Jesus , the end of lust , pride , and strife , which we have found to be the cause of fightings , and suits at law , and if any thing of that nature would arise in any of us , by our judge and lawgiver it is judged , and we are saved ; and it is laid upon us by the same spirit of Christ , not to sue any man at the law , nor to seek to avenge ourselves of such as seek to wrong us , but to love our enemies , and pray for them that despitefully use us , and hate us ; and so from all men to suffer for peace sake , for to peace we are called , towards all men , and under the Prince of peace is our government , so that we need not men to end controversies amongst us , who are all in unity of spirit , and life , in Christ Jesus . 

But when men hail us before judgement-seats , or cause us to appear at their courts of law , than we meet with many things among them there , which for conscience sake we cannot bow to , nor uphold , finding them , not only against the rule of Christians , but , out of the way of common honesty as men , yea many things against truth itself , and this we cannot serve , as law , which is against truth . 

As when they send a writ to appear at their courts , in a man's own proper person , and in obedience thereto we have come , ( May be ) two hundred miles or above , and tendered our appearance accordingly , at the very day appointed , than they have with violence and reproach thrust us out of their court• ▪ because we did appear in our own person• , and not •n another man's person , whom we have not known , and for this have we suffered much damage , & long imprisonment , as contemners of authority and law now , this we cannot join to in our hearts , nor own as honesty , and truth , and plain dealing as men , to let go , all talk of Christian• , the heathen would not do this to us 

Also , when our adversary puts up a bill o• charge against us , drawn up in a form without truth , filled with false accusations , a•though our offence amounted to hundred or thousands of pounds wrong , or damage , when with the truth of Christ in our conscience we know , that we have never wronged that man one penny in our lives , but that it is the enemy of truth , and peace , even that old accuser of the brethren , which now works in that creature to spoil our goods or take our lives , or liberties from us ; then , we are not suffered to return an answer in the fear of our God , and in plainness and truth of expressions , as the spirit of truth shall move in the simplicity of our hearts ; and so , with the spirit of truth to deny the lies and false accusations , of the adversary ; but we must be forced to give unreasonable sums of money , to another man , whom we know not , nor knows he our state and case in this matter , to answer in our stead , who for aught we know , May in stead of sharply reproving those abominable lies , justify them , at least as a legal thing , or form at law , fit to be used . And thus our testimony against falsehood is taken from us , which the spirit of truth requires of us , and we pay money to have it justified , as a form at law , when we know it to be a form of lies ; and we cannot leave the truth , to serve this deceit ; beside , were the truth no dearer to us , but that we could thus give it up to be betrayed knowingly , yet it seems to us unreasonable , as men , to give our cause into the hands of him that knows it not , further than we must inform him , nor when we have informed him , have no assurance whether he will speak our words or his own , or our adversaries , and so bring us under the guilt of the whole body of falsehood . This appears to us very unreasonable , and dangerous , and below the privilege of a man , as a man , much more as a Christian , so we rather choose to suffer innocently under falsehood , keeping our consciences clear , then consent thereto , and so establish mischief under pretence of a law , psal. 94.20 . and deny our testimony for the truth , to which we are called , and for which we suffer in all these things . 

Also , if any of us be sued at the exchequer or chancery , and appear and take a copy of the bill , and go to the judges with a true answer thereto , they will refuse it , because we cannot swear , though they will show us no written law for so doing , but tell us its a custom , and this custom is preferred above his law who saith , swear not at all ; and for this have many been imprisoned , it being put upon us either to deny their custom , or Christ's command , so we choose to suffer by men , for a season , rather than defile our consciences . 

If we be summoned to do service for the country , on a jury , and be willing to do the service faithfully as to God and man , yet because we cannot swear , many are fined , imprisoned , and their goods spoilt , and reputed unserviceable in the nation , when we would freely serve the country , so as we Might not therein deny Christ , our saviour . 

If one of us be summoned to appear at a court for a witness , that would testify the truth before God from a good conscience , and in the fear of God , and according to his law , viz. in all things , that if we should wrong any man whatsoever through our false testimony , that its just the same should be done to us , yet because we cannot swear , ( Be the action never so great , ) our true testimony is refused , and we thrust away without judgement , & threatened to cause us to pay , what they say the party is damnified for our not swearing , and all this we must suffer for obeying Christ's commands . 

If one of us should buy a piece of land , or have some fallen to him by inheritance , and come to the court Baron to take it up , they will not let him take it , except he swear , and so break Christ's sayings ; or if a man purchase , or have an inheritance within a customary court , it 's the same , and they will turn us without it , if we will not swear contrary to Christ's commands . And thus is the evil custom of a cour• preferred before Christ's commands , a good conscience , and a families whole estate and livelihood . 

If a man bind an apprentice in this city of London , and give a great sum of money with him , and the prentice serves his time honestly and truly , and have his Master's testimony thereto , yet is he denied his freedom , if he cannot swear for conscience sake , and so must lose money and service , if he be faithful to Christ . 

If one of us should die intestate , they will not suffer our own wife or children to administer on our own goods , unless they will swear against their conscience , and the law of Christ ; or if we make a will , and make wife or children executer , they are denied to prove the will , whereby they are to enjoy their estates , but by breaking that command of Christ in swearing . 

Likewise , when some of us have been arrested to appear at such a court such a day , and have simply given bond to appear ; and when the ap•earance hath been made at the day expressed by the party so bound , neither the appearance would be taken , nor the bond delivered , but a further snare , because another man appears not for us whom we never knew , nor had aught to do withal . 

Also about marriage , which we know to be an ordinance of God from the beginning , and being ordered in the counsel of God , and the bed not defiled is honourable , but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge . so as any are moved of the Lord into that state , we say the counsel of the Lord is first and chiesely to be minded , and the thing weighed in his sear , that it be done only in the Lord , that it be not taken on lightly , rashly , nor by any fleshly motion , nor for any earthly ends , but in the moving & ordering of the almighty creator of man and woman , who only knows their spirits . So to join them , as they May be one in flesh and spirit , that he May seek a godly seed to himself , and they May lead a godly and peaceable life ; & only thus is it God's ordinance , as God puts together , and saith Christ , let not man put such asunder ; and this we say is the chief thing to be observed , viz. that God join them ; and next that notice be given to the parents , or such as have the oversight of each party , that ( As much as May be ) all May be done in love and unity in the will of God openly . And this we have from God in spirit , and this we find in scripture , to be the ordinance of God to his saints of old , and their liberty in the Lord ; which God never altered , which we keep for conscience sake , and May not break . And least any licentious persons should abuse this liberty , to satisfy their lusts , and then not live as man and wise during their lives , and the magistrates not know of them , and so they escape the sword of justice ; we have freedom in our spirits , to acquaint some of the next magistrates with our intents , and hereby confess ourselves liable to the just censure of the magistrate , with others , in case of misdemeanour , and all this we have done ere coming together as man and wife , which is as much as the ordinance of God , or any reas•n can justly require , yet have some of us suffered in this case , by the changeable laws of men , who some of them have sought to impose one sort of priests on us as an ordinance , others justices as an ordinance , and others another sort of priests again : so for denying these uncertain rules of men , and keeping the ordinance of God that was in the beginning , we suffer by all of them as evil doers , yet have they not one charge against any of us , who have been joined according to this ordinance of God , as to breach of marriage , or misdemeanour therein : for we ha•e putting away , and come to that which was in the begginning . 

These with many other things there be , as touching the outward laws , whereby both our lives , l•bertieses , and estates , become a daily prey to merciless men , from which hath been manifest such imprisoning till death , such persecution and spoil of goods , as many generations to come May admire to read of , though in this generation its little regarded or minded , unless it be by some few , whose hearts God hath tendered , that have not been so cruel in their places as others . 

Now let none say , that because we cannot bow to such unrighteous dealings of corrupt men , or their corrupt customs , or corrupt laws , that therefore we are a persons that would have no law , nor magistracy at all , as some have falsely accused us : for of this we are clear before the Lord our God , what ever men May accuse us •erein , for the law of God we own in our conscience , even the law of the spirit of life , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord and lawgiver , by which we are taught , to keep our consciences void of offence towards God and towards men , by which we are freed from under the power of the law of sin and death . and by this law of God in our consciences , are we also taught to be subject to every power our god shall set up over us , by which teaching we know that the powers that be , are ordained of God . And by the same law of God in our hearts and consciences , by which we are made to suffer , rather than to obey that which is unjust , by the same law , and upon the same penalty are we made to be subject and obey every just and wh•lesome law of man , for conscience sake ; therefore , as the ordinance of God , we obey , and own authority in the nation ; and the ruler of the persons as the minister of God , for good to such as do well , but a terror to every evil doer without respect of persons ; so we being guided by the pure law of God in our consciences , are subject not for wrath , but for conscience sake ; for he is not a terror to them that do well , and obey God in their consciences : but if any do evil , let such fear , for he is the minister of God , and bears not the sword in vain . and for this cause we pay tribute , to whom it belongs , and fear to whom fear , honour to whom honour ; and from this we exempt not ourselves , more than other persons in the same nation , but desire rather to be examples to others , with all diligence , not speakinq evil of governments as many do , which will flatter to their faces , but seeking to our God for what authority he shall ordain , that under them we May be godly and quietly governed , without respect of persons . 

Therefore we Might say , as to all the several rulers that hath arisen in these years since we were a persons in God's light , which of them have we reviled or sought to supplant , or what just law , old or new ? ( Which hath been just , and according to scriptures , or a good conscience ) have we denied or transgressed ? though from the evil and abuse of all , God hath by his eternal light , and the power of his spirit , preserved us to this day , glory to our God for evermore ; so our consciences are clear towards them that are fallen as to that thing , by whom we so much suffered in their day . 

And now in God's dread and fear we are , and in his pure counsel alone , we desire to be found towards you that are now come up into the seat of government , that if by any means , we Might not be any occasion of offence , or hardening of your hearts , by our disobedience or denying any of your laws , which are just , wholesome and good , and according to God's truth in scriptures ; nor , that on the contrary we Might provoke our pure eyed , and zealous God and father , to displeasure against us , by yielding to any thing whatsoever , or obeying what is any way against his spirit in our hearts , or the light of Christ in our consciences . And this at present is our straight way , set before us to walk in towards God , and towards man , and therefore the desire and travail of our souls is great at this day , that you Might be one with God in your laws and commands , that so , under you we Might be godly and quietly governed , within and without . But if yet , it must be so , that your distance be so great , that with one heart we cannot obey you both , then whether it is better to obey God or men , ( With the light of God in your own consciences ) judge you , therefore if we can but keep peace with the one of you , we choose to keep our everlasting peace with God , and that saving saith that 's held in a pure conscience ; and our prayers to the father of lights is , for our whole body of Christ's church , and every member thereof , that our hearts May be kept single to him alone , what ever we suffer from men for so doing . 

Now to those things which some call religious . 

Though in ourselves we make no such distinction , it being that our consciences are to be exercised in the light and spirit of Christ , in all we do towards God , and towards man , and every particular action towards men , God requires that it be done as to him , and to his glory , and not in our own wills , nor in men's wills , nor after their wills , manners , and customs , and commands , but in the will of God alone , revealed in Christ Jesus in spirit , and in his motion and leadings , which if we miss in , and serve either men or ourselves therein , and not God , we are accountable to him , as though we had erred in that which the world calls religion ; therefore , what ever we do to God in Christ , to us is his service and pure religion , and undefiled before God , if we keep but our conscience unspotted from the world ; though it be but in visiting a fatherless child , or a widow , in their affliction , or any other thing which the spirit of truth , justice and mercy leads us to , and requires of us . 

But , as the worship of God itself , hath relation to him alone , who is a spirit , and will be worshipped in spirit , and in truth , betwixt him and every particular creature only known , in matter , measure and manner , time and place . And knowing that the only wise God , who gives the kingdoms of the earth to whom he will , yea , and May set over them the basest of men , as well as the most virtuous , without control , if he please so to deal in judgement towards any nation , yet this hath he reserved as an eternal sceptre in the hand of Jesus our Lord , and by an everlasting covenant hath he sworn once for all , concerning him , thou art a King for ever , over the holy persons , and his throne is established in their consciences by a perpetual decree , to all generations , therefore was it never known , that ever he trusted or titled any earthly Prince , with Lord over the faith and consciences of his own persons ; this was ever the s•nss prerogative above the Kings of the earth , and he alone is to be judge and lawgiver , and correcter , and leader , in that invisible spiritual work of worship , towards God , for he only knows the way , and none comes to the father but by him . 

it 's true , the Pope hath taken upon himself , such authority under pretence of the apostles , even over the faith and consciences of persons , and with it hath shed much innocent blood , which lies upon his seat , and his line , till God come to inquire for it , and for that end hath set up inquisitions &c.  And others after and from that , have erected courts , and synods with their fines , and prisons , and tortures , to force the faith and consciences of persons , and they pretend the apostles also , for this work . But , this we know that the apostles was no such men , nor used any such weapons , but deny them therein both the Pope , and they that are risen since ; and expressly deny to be Lords over God's heritage or over their faith , neither did they preach themselves Lords , and Masters , but Christ Jesus alone the Lord , and themselves servants for Jesus sake , as both their own words & practice doth testify ; for saith Paul , not for that we have dominion over your faith ; and saith Peter , not for filthy lucre , neither as being Lords over God's heritage , but as examples to the flock . 

So we know that from Peter they had it not , nor from Paul , nor from any of the true ministers of Christ , for their weapons was not carnal but spiritual , nor did they wrestle with flesh , but with spirit ; so all they can get from the apostles , either in word or practice , is this , that if they be troubled with errors , or profaneness in their churches ; then , if they have the spirit and power of the Lord Jesus , then to deliver such a one up to Satan , for the destruction of the flesh , that the soul May be saved , and body also in the day of the Lord . And this is not to goals , or gallows , or inquisitions , or tortures , or fires ; now , had they this spirit and power , they would know that which would convert in deed and truth , and not make hypocrites , or else kill them , but the false church having not these weapons , nor this spirit and power , is builded with oppression , and upholden with blood . and in her are found the blood of all the holy martyrs of Jesus , as saith the scriptures , yea , even now is she drunk with blood , revel. 18.24 . & 17.6 . 

So now , this is the thing we say as to the worship of our God , and to the order of it ; in all things it belongs to Christ Jesus our Lord , and to him as sole King & Lord thereof , we commit ourselves , even the whole man , soul and body , as to all things of that nature . And though there May ari•e power after power , and seek t• stop us of this liberty and freedom , by acting force and violence upon our outward man , yet are we free , by birth in Christ Jesus , and our inw•rd man they cannot bind , nor can we ever while we abide in that see•e , give up the right of Christ unto any of them ; but this we testify in all we do or suffer , that the right is Christ's , over our consciences , and over our worships , and to him alone we confess before men ; and he hath the name in us ; and though for a time , or times , we yet suffer , yet we know the end must come ; and the lamb must take the kingdom , and we know him that is true and faithful , whom the father hath sealed , and anointed to be head of the •hurch which is his body , and to him must the nations account ; and therefore we say to all the several powers that comes upon us , we May not deny the Lord in our consciences , to bow to , or worship in what men shall set up or command ; but he that saves us daily from our sins . he shall lead us in our worship , and to him we must give the obedience of faith , who gives us faith and power by his spirit to obey , and who hath wrought all our works in us and for us , and by whose virtue it is we live , and bring forth to rhe praise of God , and we are not our own , nor servants of men but we are bought with a price , that we May serve him for ever ▪ by whom we are redeemed and by whom all men without respect of persons , must eternally be judged , or justified . 

Therefore we say , this is a privilege , that no man should be hindered of , ( To wit ) the liberty of his conscien•e towards his god , but that an universal lib••ty for all sorts of persons , to worship God , according as Christ shall open men's eyes to see the truth ▪ and as he shall persuade their hearts , by his spirit , seeing no man without Christ can do any thing in this case acceptable to God , neither can one man worship in the measure of another , but in his own measure , as he receives of God in Christ Jesus faith and strength , and spirit , for it must be in spirit , and of faith , else it is sin , in God's sight , what ever men think thereof . 

And this is just and equal in the sight of God , and all reasonable men , and that which i know no understanding man or woman would be limited in , seeing all have immortal souls from God , and to him alone must account for them ▪ and not to men ; that so every soul May stand and fall , to his own Master in this case ▪ seeing none can save his brother , when he hath misled him , nor account to God for him ; therefore he is no wise man ( In our eyes ) who will leave the light of Christ that once knows it , to follow another man's opinion ; and seeing every man would have this liberty for himself , why should he go about to deny it to his brother , how is that just or equal , amongst men ? And how doth it answer the law of Christ as Christians , who hath commanded , that all things whatsoever you would that men should do unto you , do ye even so to them , for this is the law and the prophets ; now if you be not come so far in equity , as to answer the law and the prophets , how will you answer Christ , you that profess him in words . 

And were it not that nations , and men were drunk , and bewitched with the fornication of that scarlet coloured whore , they would foresee the danger of taking that upon them which belongs to Christ alone , it being so many have been broken on the same rock , and reason itself Might show them how safe it is , not to be too forward in things of that nature , which God hath not called them to ; and also it being so much contrary to that just principle in man which would lead every man to do to another as he would be done unto ; and would teach every man that he ought to give up himself to his God , in all spiritual matters ; and that so he should suffer every other creature also ; and seeing that there is no infallibility amongst •en , without the immediate manifestation of Christ Jesus his light and spirit in them , but that since men took that upon them , even to sit as Lords and judges over faith and conscience ; the Lord hath scattered them in this thing , and confounded them into so many minds and judgements , that he that is subject to follow every change in these latter days , shall scarcely abide in one opinion a year to an end ; which things duly weighed , Might stay the haste of every reasonable man from forcing that upon the conscience of another , which himself is not infallible in , and for which he must account to God for all souls that err through him , and so perish , in gainsaying God's witness . 

And this would be wisdom , with God , first to search in themselves whether they have tha• call from God himself , to force any , or they do it to answer the desires of others , or to hold up a tradition , and so Might they come to see , what they serves , and whether it will bear persecution or bloodshedding at t•e day of judgement ; and prove whether you have that which is infallible to force them to , or it be but thought , and opinion of yourselves , or others , seeing its so common a thing for rulers and teachers to join in forcing persons that are under them to err , and for which so many have been confounded and cast out , and so that all Might come to prove their work , and bring it to the light , to see whether it be wrought in God , and if he will own it with his light , which is pure in their conscience , which is an equal rule , and try what power and spirit it is that God hath made Lord & King , and lawgiver and leader in all his worship ; and if they have not this , than it is the old persecuter , and murderer , which uses to set persons on fire that know not God in spirit ; and if you have that spirit which God hath given the power to in his church , than its gentle , drawing and powerful , without forceable imposing , or killing , nor doth he ever compel against faith and conscience . 

Now there be many particular things as to God's worship and things thereto pertaining , which the men of this age would impose upon us , yea , and force them upon great penalties , which the spirit of Christ doth not lay upon us as matters of faith or practice , nor ever did o•daine them in any age , nor command them to b• observed in his church , as men now impos••hem , but the contrary we find from the spirit of Christ , both in the oldness of letter , and i• newness of life ; so these things we canno• bow •o , nor worship in , for conscience sake , •onscience towards God conscience towards the holy men of God in the holy life , and conscience towards the scripture of truth ; for of all these we make conscience , in their time and place , in which God the father of all hath brought them forth to serve him . 

As men would impose upon our consciences to come once a week , to such a great house in their parish , which they call a parish church , and there we must observe what one man shall read , preach or pray , for two or three hours that day , by an usual form , and this man will have a clerk , and he shall say amen at the end of such a sentence , or part of his prayer or speech , and to this church , and to this worship must we be bound while we dwell in that parish ; and either the tithes of all we have , or so much a year set maintenance , must be paid to the man calling himself a minister of Christ ; and so much a year to his clerk for saying amen after him , in money and eggs , and the like ; and if this we do constantly , we May live peaceably by them , and go under the name of a good Christian , and a religious man , but if we fail in any of this , but especially in that of tithes or wages ; then they call us heretics , and complain of us to the magistrate , or sue us at law , till they have cast our bodies into prisons , and taken the spoil of our goods . Now God having revealed his true worship to u• i• the light of Christ , which is is in spi•it and truth , and called us out of carnal things •or which there is no scripture , we ••nn• for conscience sake , worship any more therein . 

Now , neither by the spirit of Christ in us , nor by letter of scriptures without us , nor by the example of all the holy men of God that hav• walked before us , can we for conscience sake own , nor uphold that for the true and spiritual worship of God in spirit and truth , neither to repair their house , maintain their priest , nor his clerk , as they would impose upon us . 

Now some have said , what would you have no church , minister , preaching , praying , nor none of this worship , nor maintenance , &c.  What would you have ? 

We say yes , we own a church , ministering , preaching , praying , and the maintenance that thereto belongs , but we would have them to be of God , and after his will in Christ Jesus , and not after the will and traditions of men , contrary both to God , good men and the scriptures of truth ; for we read of a church of Christ in scriptures , but it was in God the father , and our Lord Jesus Christ . and we read of a ministry of Christ in scripture , made not of man , neither by man , but by the revelation of the son of God in them ; and the gospel or ministry that they preached , was not after man , nor received of man , neither was they taught it , but by revelation of Jesus chest . and we read of a maintenance they had , which was to live of the gospel ; and the spirituals which they sowed freely without money or money-worth , brought them forth fruits freely , both in spiritual things , and worship towards God , and in carnal things towards their outward wants , and as they planted , so they eat ; and where the plant grew , and the soul prospered , till it could bring forth fruit freely , there they need not to sue them and to take it by spoil , but of the world they looked for naught but persecution , nor ever coveted or compelled any such thing from any creature , no not where they had sown and planted , unless it grew in spirit and life to God , they looked not to reap any thing but loss , if that which they had sown withered in the way , therefore did they watch for the soul , and not for tithes , pigs , and eggs and geese , and sheaves , &c. but that the soul prospered towards God , that was their prize ; and to make the gospel without charge , that was their reward , if they did it freely and willingly , but if not willingly , than a necessity was laid upon them , and woe was their portion . 

And these went on and prospered , gathering churches out of the world into God , from place to place , even where they was not sent for ; they went freely as they was moved of the holy spirit : and if anywhere they came was found worthy to receive them , with them they Might eat freely what was set before them , where the spirit was free , but they did not seat themselves in a town , or say , this is my parish , and this is my hire , so much a year , but wandered to and fro having no certain dwelling place , nor was their bellies any part of the bargain , as to coming , preaching , staying ▪ or going , as to any place . 

And when they had gathered a church into the spirit and life of Christ Jesus , which brought them to meet together , than they did not Lord it over them in faith or conscience , neither was they called their Masters , but still servants for Christ sake ; nor did they get a glass and set up , and if any spoke in their time , while they was speaking , say they broke their peace , and send them to prison , but said , all Might prophesy , that all Might be edified ; and it was joy to them to hear any to speak by the spirit , either son or daughter . and some Might speak , and some Might judge , of what was spoken ; and if any thing was revealed to him that stood by , the first was to hold his peace ; and the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets . now this church and its order we own , where ever we find it to be after God , and in him ; but when we meet with a company of persons that denies all this ; and if any be moved in the spirit ▪ either to speak while they are speaking , or judge what they have spoken ; then the teacher cries away to prison with him , and the persons runs upon us all a heaps , ready to pull us to pieces ; this we own not , nor doth Christ , nor the scriptures own it to be his church , t•is is not the spirit of the prophets , nor subject to the prophets , but the rude spirit which tumul•ed upon the apostles and prophets of old . 

So here is somewhat declared of the ministry we own , and his maintenance , but of such a thing as a clerk we read not in scriptures , neither name nor office . And now let none think it strang• or an error in us , to compare & weigh and •ry and prone things , for we are Christians , & have received the spirit that is of God , that we May know the things that are given to us of God , from things that are of the world ; and we May not receive every one for a minister of Christ , who tells us he is , nor that for a church that every one calls a church , nor that for worship which every one would impose upon us ; for things had need of trying , and spirits also , and we hold fast that which is good its true in the world there be many churches , and many heads , gods many , and Lords many , many faiths ▪ and many opinions , but in Christ Jesus 〈◊〉 called to unity in all these things , so 〈◊〉 we say with the churches of Christ in •cripture , to us there is on• body , one spirit , one 〈◊〉 , one faith , one baptism , one God and fathe• of all , who is above all , and through all , and in us all . and this one god in us is a spirit , and will be worshipped in spirit , & in truth , so of us he requires truth , and that we worship no other things , nor bow to them ; though all men have not this faith but can follow any thing in their worship , which is the fashion of the nation where they live , but this we are called out of ; and into that one worship we are come which is in spirit and truth , for in that is the father worshipped , and God hath sought us out of the many worships that are in the world , in spirit to worship him ; and Christ saith , these are the true worshippers that so worship , and •nto this hath Christ led us , and in it he owns us in his spirit , and the father owns us , and testifies to us in every enlightened conscience , and in this we are come to the spirits of just men , and they own us ; and the letter of scriptures it owns us also , and in this we have peace , though persecuted . 

But in all these , we read not in all the gospel worship , of any temple made with hands , to bind men to , nor parish churches , nor preaching by the hour , nor for so much a year , nor that ever minister of Christ took tithes , nor their hearers gave them , but confessed Christ come , and a free gospel , and said •oth the priesthood that took tithes , and the law by which they received them was disannulled by the sufferings of Christ ; nor do we read of sprinkling infants , and calling that baptising them into the church , nor do we read of their singing David's words in a metre , nor praying in a form , nor a clerk to lead the psalm , and say amen ; and much more we Might mention , which was never used so in the true church but is come to a form since popery came up , & the scripture bears no testimony thereto , as now these things are used , and all that can be truly said for them is long custom , but from plain scriptures they cannot prove them . 

Indeed we read in the scriptures of truth , of the gospel preaching , but it was not limited to one house , nor by a glass , but from house to house , and city to city , and that by the spirit , and their worship was in spirit , they prayed with the spirit , and they sung with the spirit , and h• that had a psalm sung it with the spirit , and with understanding also ; and they worshipped , and preached in fields and mountains , and streets , & schools , and markets , and they prayed by seashores , or in any place where God moved and led them by the spirit of Jesus ; and all this we own which the scriptures testifies to , in our measure ; and this is that we would have all brought to trial , and that worship owned , which Christ and the scriptures owns , and none forced against it , by any means whatsoever , which is come up since the scriptures was written , and the apostles times . 

And this motion , is not unreasonable , hurtful or dangerous to any , especially ( We May say ) in this nation , how can it be denied , wherein all other forms in words profess the scriptures to be a rule for all to walk by ? And to you all •his is our motion , that the scriptures May be heard what it saith without wresting , and what sort of worship it testifies of , let that have the name to be of God , and then let none be forced from it ; and if you deny to be tried in your faith and profession , by that you have so long called your rule and touchstone , and then reproach and persecute them that walk in it , will not your own words judge you , before men , and shall not you walk under condemnation from God in your own consciences . And thus in short have we showed our desires , and what we would have in this thing , which Might free every tender conscience from oppression , and the magistrates of the nations from the guilt thereof before God . 

Will you call yourselves Christian magistrates , and Christian ministers , and set yourselves against what Christ hath wrought by the power of his spirit ▪ and is now working , and think you •re doing him service , when you are grieving his spirit , and persecuting him in his members , for doing that to which he immediately leads them now , as in the days of old ; is not this in effect to say , depart from our nations , we will have none of thy ways , nor shall any under our government , or that will follow our teachings obey thy spirit if we can stop them by our power , is not this to withstand his appearance , and resist the power that you profess to rule for . 

Do you not read in the acts of the apostles , what labour and suffering they underwent to bring persons out of carnal rudiments and ordinances of men , and to bring them to the worship in spirit and truth alone , both as to time , place , and order ; how did they run in hazard of their lives , into temples , synagogues , and set places of worship , to bring them out of temples made with hands , to worship where the spirit should lead them , without respect of places ; that so the words of the Lord Jesus Might be fulfilled , who had said , not in the temple , nor in the mountain , but in spirit and in truth should the father be worshipped ; and did not Stephen lose his life for telling them that God that made the world dwelled not in temples made with hands ; and Paul suffered fo• the same testimony , and they told them the most high God , could not be worshipped with men's hands , nor carnal things , but in s•irit . •nd in •ruth ; and how often was they tumul•ed and beaten , and their blood shed for this test•mony , against the beggarly rudiments , & 〈◊〉 ordinances of men , both of Jews , who had their ordinances from the letter ▪ and ••so the gentiles who followed their customers , that out of all carnal things they Might bring them , to follow God in spirit , and therein alone to serve him . 

And while you profess all this in words , will you be the men that will deny the very same in works , and shall you be guiltless , shall not both Jews and gentiles rise in judgement against you , and condemn you , who acts against knowledge , scriptures , and your own profession ? And is it not so with you rulers and teachers of this generation ? what force and cruelty hath been used to bring persons back to your idol temples made with hands , there to worship and nowhere else , and to repair them , and to bow to the customs of men there set up , for which there is neither scriptures nor example ; even too many to mention , what imprisoning and •ormenting of the spiritual worshippers of the living God , hath there been in these last days for these things ? what sufferings have some gone through , but for testifying against these traditious carnal , & saying the church must be in God , and that every one must come to be led by the spirit alone in all their whole worships , and so give the kingdom & leading of his persons to the leading of Christ that spirit again , in all things pertaining to worship , life and godliness ▪ hath not this been a dangerous thing in thi• age to bear this record of God in Christ , 〈◊〉 to become his witness ? how ma•y 〈◊〉 lost their liberties , their estates , and  lives for this testimony in word 〈◊〉 •••c•ise , which reconciles to God in all 〈◊〉 whole worship ? and yet the same is read and preached , every first day among them that do this to such as live the life thereof for Jesus sake ; these are not the works of Christians indeed , in the apostles sense , but of such as know not God , nor the word of reconciliation , have not . 

How many have suffered in this age , but for reproving sin in the gate , cursing , pride , lying , and swearing ; how have some been beaten , pulled and hailed , and dragged through streets and channels , and before judgement seats , and to prisons , for no other things ; how many have woefully suffered , but for preaching repentance through streets , towns , and markets , in the name of the Lord , and by the call of his holy spirit ; how many hundred have been imprisoned for preaching the everlasting gospel of Jesus freely , in towns , temples , streets , and markets , and from house to house , which was the manner of God's messengers in the name of his son ever to do , and for which they suffered ; how many have had their clothes rent off their backs , and been shamefully beaten till they have been left for dead , and afterward carried to prison , for but asking a question , or speaking a word in a steplehouse , while a man hath been speaking things doubtful , or not true , though this was the way of old , in which the servants of Christ walked , and by which he gathered the churches into God in spirit , and out of false worships ; and it was the manner of the apostles to enter into synagogues and places of worships both of Jews and gentiles on their Sabbath days , and openly dispute there with them before their hearers , and then whose hearts God touched , lest their carnal worships and clove to Christ in spirit , which is now become a greater offence to this generation , than ever it was either to Jews or gentiles ; for i never read that simply for so disputing , they either beat them or haled them to prison , though they went sometimes three Sabbath days together into one synagogue , yea , the fiery Jews , who was set on mischief against that way , yet this they could suffer in their synagogue , as is testified acts 17.2 . and saith the scrip•ureses , this was his manner . and in acts•8 . 4 . it is said , he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day at Corinth , where he continue a year and six months teaching the word of God among them , vers. 11.  

Now hath not this been the great offence of these days , yea , i May say the chiefest crime which the servants of Jesus Christ hath suffered for , in this age , and none scarce either ruler or teacher is able to bear it once , which they could bear a year and above , among Jews and heathens ; so that this way of Christ by which the churches was gathered & called in the apostles time , is become more abominable in the sight of those that calls themselves Christians , than it was either to Jews or heathens ; and when neither laws of Jews , gentiles , nor heathens , that was made in times of popery , would answer their wills against this , than ha•e they made new laws of their own against this practice , which themselves read , believe and preach ; and this we cannot own , that men should withstand that in works which they profess in words , and seek to impose it upon others who serve God therein by the spirit of Jesus , and then call themselves Christians , and say the scriptures is their rule , who cannot bear it in them that practise it in obedience to Christ Jesus . 

And this is that we contend for in all our sufferings and actings , in the simplicity of our hearts , that our Lord and Master Jesus Christ , May have his prerogative royal restored to him , over his body , the church , and every particular member thereof , his lordship , and mastership , given to him alone of all his children , from least to the greatest , and that none else force it , or require it from him , but that his headship alone over his church , his leadings , and the seat of his judgements , in every redeemed soul and conscience , ma• be restored to him , and that he m•y have 〈◊〉 name and authority therein , and that none May presume to take his authority to themselves , while they give him fair words , & call him , Lord , Lord , but neither do his will in their own consciences , nor suffer them that would ; this i say , is that we seek now at the hands of men that are called Christians , which by his own blood , and by the precious suff•ringss in many of his obedient servants of old , he once purchased out of the hands of the old persecutors ▪ and gave it as inheritance to his seed after him to all generations , to call him head and lor• in the• and over them , in all things pertaining to worship and conscience , as the scripture of truth is evident . 

And this we say in his behalf , and in the power of his name , where ever he sends us , that though his adversary of old , hath taken this his purchased possession from him , and now sits where he ought not , commandding in conscience , over his subjects and creatures , compelling and forcing , to obey his traditions and law from a carnal precept , or tradition of men , yet we say the right is Christ's alone , and the whole kingdom of God in every conscience he hath purchased with his blood and great sufferings of old ; therefore we say to all sorts of persons , look to him and walk in his light , all that look to be saved ; for we say he is a great and mighty one , who though he have been as one gone a far journey for a time , yet he is returned , and hath seen how his dear servants have been entreated , and his little children spoilt of their birthright , and cast out of their purchased possession , and heavenly kingdom , and now strangers rule over their tender consciences , and s••ke to defile them , with adultery and idolatry , which is against their spiritual birth , and breathing , and himself robbed of his authority , and sceptre of his everlasting dominion , for which he will tread nations in his wrath , and persons in his hot displeasure , even for z•on• sake the city of his glory , and he will spoil the spoiler , and lead captivity captive , and so will he make way for his inheritance , to come into their habitation of •est ▪ 

And this we say to •ll persons , give up , fear God , and gi•e glory to his name , for the hour of hi• judgements is come , and he will have dominion as of old , and his purchased possession as in anc•ent days ; but especially to you who are called Christians , and mention his name , and call him Lord , and profess the scriptures , in words , which testifies of him , his sufferings , and his purchase through blood , and the eternal anointing of the father , sworn unto him , by an everlasting covenant , that he alone shall sit on the spiritual throne , over the house of David for ever ▪ that he May with his spiritual leadings gather the outcasts of Israel , and present to God all the precious among the persons ; have you not read you professing priests and rulers , that it is he alone that is the light of the world , and that God hath given him for a witness to the persons , a leader and commander ; that its he that 's appointed for a light to them that sit in dakness , and in the shadow of death , to guide their feet in the way of peace ; did God ever set any at the right hand of power but he alone , that he Might make his foes his footstool ; of whom he saith when he brings him into the world , let all the angels of God worship him ; have you not read that it 's he alone that purgeth the conscience from dead works , and will you not suffer him to reign and govern therein ; hath not he quickened every living soul , and create anew , every free spirit , and would you take and keep the kingdom therein , out of his hand , and rule there for another , or yourselves , with force and cruelty ; is not this he for whom the Sabbath was made , and all the ordinances under heaven speaks his dominion ▪ and will you now read this and profess , and withstand him in the consciences of his tender persons , and deny him to rule in his church alone ? have you not read what God hath said of him , and his enemies in the second psalm ; nay , are not all the scriptures his , and testify to him alone , as head over all , and ruler in all his saints ? And as you have heard ▪ read , and professed , his dominion more than heathens , and yet go on to keep it from him ; so to you is his first appear•nce , to seek his own of you ; and if you persist to deny him , it 's you must drink the cup first , that the heathens May hear and fear his name fr•m far , and his rising appear to all the ends of the world , that its he alone who is from everlasting ▪ at whose name every knee must bow , and tongue confess , to the right of his inheritance . 

And this further i lay before you persons of this nation , who have long been crying for peace and settlement in the nations , and in your religion , and you cry out of so many divisions , and so many religions ; i say to you all , how should you be otherwise , when you will not come to the one religion that is of God , and was in the beginning with God , and brought forth in time by Jesus Christ , for the bringing all into God again , and reconciling all sorts of scattered persons , who are scattered in the imaginations and customs of carnal spirited men , from God the one good thing , into many things , rudiments , and traditions , wherein you can neither be reconciled to God , nor one to another ; for how is it like that ever that religion can reconcile to God , which sets you a killing one another to uphold it ? are you like to obtain peace in that spirit which in your hearts is the cause of enmity and war or obtain unity from that root , which hath thus scattered you in its fruits and off spring ; this is like the false prophets of old , who would bite with their teeth , and cry peace ▪ 

Nay this is not the way of settlement or lasting peace , that , you must have in returning ; and making peace with the spirit of Jesus , you must kiss the son and so make peace , for this hath been seen concerning you of these nations , that if you own not the light of Christ in spirit and truth , that he May lead you out of these many things which are not of •od , and reconcile you to God in spirit and truth , there to worship him alone who is a spirit , you will ere long be in blood , either amongst yourselves , one against another , or else i• the blood of the innocent lambs of chri•t , which will not be for your peace with God , for he that hath letted your peace and settlement , is not yet taken away , nor his power , who is that old bloodsucker , and divider of nations , persons , and tongues , abou• faith and religions , and with which a fire hath often been kindled ; nor can his power be stopped , but by the spirit of the lamb of God , which takes away sin , and breaks down the wall of separation , which is made about ordinances , literal , ceremonial , and traditional , which can never cease , but as men turn to the spirit of the Lord Jesus , that with the light of peace and truth you May be led into peace , truth , and unity , that wrath May be done away , and the ground thereof , and you and your religion May be settled on the foundation of truth , Christ Jesus the chief corner stone , and not upon , days , times , meats , drinks , and apparel , and other things which will perish with the using , and so will they that worship and not in the leadings of Christ alone ▪ and God will shake the idols of people's minds , and all the glory of flesh , that he alone May be exalted in the earth , as he is in heaven . 

So if you will have peace you must come to the son of peace ▪ and if you will have establishment , you must come to the foundation of the prophets and apostles of God ; for i say , many have been about to build a house for God to dwell in , with carnal things , and rudiments , and this they would bind him to , ( & his persons , ) who is a spirit , and his house must be built of spiritual men and women , who like living stones must grow up in his own light and virtue into a holy temple in the Lord ; in which you must be builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit , eph. 2.20 , 21 , 22.  And this is God's house built by Christ alone , with that which is elect and precious , not with gold and garments , or observations of perishing things , but with redeemed souls by the blood of Jesus out of their vain conversation , and gathered into the spirit of truth and life , and power , to worship God who is a spirit , in spirit & truth ; and this is God's house at this day , which was his house in the apostles days , who dwells not in temples made with hands , as saith the apostles , nor with men's hands is worshipped , but with him that 's poor in spirit , and of a broken and contrite heart , to him will i look ▪ saith the Lord , and there will i dwell ; and the bodies of his holy persons are the temples of the living God , as he hath said , i will dwell in them , and walk in them , and i will be their God , and they shall be my persons , 2 cor. 6.16 . And until you come to this building of God in yourselves , God will not dwell with you in peace , but all your buildings will he confound , and not accept your sacrifice , and then the devil will enrage you against God's house and spiritual building , even his poor despised persons them to destroy ; like Cain when his sacrifice was not accepted in his own will . 

But if you turn to the Lord who is that spirit , then will he cause his light to shine in your hearts , to give you an heavenly understanding , and he will put his spirit in your inward parts , and fill you with heavenly power , and will let you see the lively image of truth and peace ; and he will take away the veil of the covering that is speed over all nations , from which arises all their carnal comprehensions , and carnal worships of the invisible spiritual God , and he will also swallow up death in victory , which now worketh in the nations , to kill one another about religion and worship , without spirit and life , so will you come to be taught his true worship , who is a spirit , and become true worshippers in spirit , and so grow up in his knowledge , and he will own your worship , whom as yet you have neither heard hi• voice at any time , nor seen his shape . and Christ saith of such worshippers , you worship you know not what ; but the true worshippers worship in faith , and know what they worship , and such the father  now seeking to worship him , saith Christ Jesus , John 4.22 , 23 , 24.  

And this is the thing oh England , tha• concerns thy peace with thy God in thi• thy day , who art cumbered with many things , about Christ and worship , but neglects the one thing needful , for thy everlasting peace and establishment , and to bring thee into that worship of spirit , withou• which God cannot accept thee , and that religion which is pure , and undefiled in the sight of God , which will keep thee unspotted in the world , which till thou turn• to , thou wilt be working against the spirit of God , through the darkness of enmity , that is in thee , and he will certainly work against thee , except thou repent . 

The end .
