An alarm of truth sounded forth to the nations ; or the way of truth from the way of error , plainly manifested and declared . 

And the true worship of God ( Which is in the spirit ) from the false worships of the world , distinguished . 

Whereby persons May come to know which way they are in , and what worship they are in , and what spirit they are of , and led by ; whether they are in the spirit of God , which the saints were in , and now are in at this day ; or the spirit of this world , which is the spirit of Antichrist , gone out into the world ; which hath the words of Christ and the saints , and a form of godliness , but denies the power where it is manifest , and is turned against it , and persecute it : but that spirit is denied , and the true spirit witnessed . 

Also an invitation ( Of love ) to all persons , and professors of all sorts and sects , to turn in their minds to the light of Christ Jesus in them , which doth reprove them for sin , which is the manifestation of the spirit of truth , which is freely given ; that with it they May all see , and try themselves , and all their teachers whom they have long followed , what spirit they are of , seeing they cannot say they have the same spirit they apostles had .

To all the persons , and teachers , and professors of all sorts in these nations , or elsewhere . 

Friends and persons , the truth hath been declared among you ; and the sound of it hath been heard by you , and the everlasting gospel hath been preached , and must be preached to all nations , kindreds and tongues , that thereby the large love of God May be known , and made manifest unto all mankind , that he would not have any to perish , but that they Might all come to the knowledge of his truth , that they Might be saved . And therefore he hath uttered forth his voice from on high , and is causing the sound of it to be heard in the nations , that all persons should fear God , and give glory to him , for the hour of his judgement is come , and coming ; and his day is appearing after so long a time of darkness , and night of apostasy which hath been over the face of the earth ; even over all nations , kindreds and persons , for many ages and generations past , so that darkness hath covered the earth , and gross darkness the persons , and the way of the Lord hath been hide from them , which is a straight way , and a way of holiness , wherein the unclean cannot walk , but they have been walking in untrodden paths , & in crooked ways , & have been erred from the Lord , and from his way , days without number , nor have not known it . For their hearts have been filled with filthiness , and all manner of uncleanness , in so much that they have committed sin with greediness , and followed after the vanities of their own minds , and walking after their own hearts lusts , to the satisfying thereof , and have been stubborn and rebellious children against the Lord , in so much that the Lord hath been against them , and his jealousy hath been provoked , and his indignation hath been kindled against them , and his wrath hath been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who have holden his truth in the unrighteousness , and there hath not been peace to him that came in , nor to him that went out ; for that which was manifested of God in them hath not been regarded , therefore hath the anger of the Lord been kindled , and his hand hath been stretched out still , because of all the abominations that have been committed in the nations , and among the persons : who have professed the knowledge of his name ; whereby his name : hath been profaned and blasphemed among the heathen round about , and his truth dishonoured which they have professed in words , but in works denied , and held it in the unrighteousness ; who have not received the truth in the love of it ( which God hath showed unto them ) nor have not obeyed it , but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness , & therefore have they been given up to strong delusions , to believe lies , and to commit iniquity with a high hand , and rejected the truth , and erred from it in their hearts , and striven against it , and have loved their evil deeds , and their unrighteous ways , and have not chosen the way of the Lord , nor served the law of the Lord with their hearts nor with their minds , but whilst they have drawn nigh unto God with their mouths and with their lips have honoured him , their hearts have been removed far off from him : and their fear towards him hath been taught by the precepts of men ; for the precepts of God , and his commands , and law in the heart hath been disregarded and cast behind their backs ; and they have despised the word of the holy one of Israel : therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble , and as the flame consumeth the chaff , so their root shall be rottenness , and their blossom shall ascend as the dust ; for behold the Lord will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury , and his rebukes with slames of fire ; for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh , who have corrupted their ways before him , and delighted in the thing that was not good , whereby he hath been provoked to anger . 

And now this is come to pass among all the professions in the world , who have had the scriptures of truth which was declared and spoken forth by the holy men of God , from the spitit of truth which was in them , and dwelled in them ; whereby they were made able ministers ( not of the letter but ) of the spirit ; by which they were able to try , and judge of all spirits whether they were of God , and saw many in their days who had gotten the true words , and had a form of godliness but denied the power , and so they turned away from such , and did bear their testimony then against such whom they saw separating themselves , being sensual having not the spirit , and saw such as were erred from the spirit going in the way of Cain , to envy , and running greedily after the error of Balaam , for gifts and rewards , and for the wages of unrighteousness , and such as served not the Lord Jesus Christ , but their own bellies , and preached for filthy lucre , and through covetousness with feigned words made merchandise of the persons , and were enemies to the cross of Christ , whose god was their belly , who gloried in their shame , whose and was destruction , who minded earthly things ; and such as had great swelling words of vanity , whilst they themselves were servants of corruption , and what they knew ; they knew naturally as bruit beasts , and in those things they corrupted themselves . And false prophets there was , as there shall be false teachers amongst you ; ( Saith the apostle ) who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth should be evil spoken of ; and that perilous times should come , that men should be lovers of themselves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy , without natural affection , truce-breakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good , traitors , heady , high-minded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God , 2 Timothy 3.  

Now all those before mentioned , were , and are erred from the spirit of truth which was in the saints , the holymen of God , who spoke forth the scriptures which declares of these things , that there was such then , and that there should be such . Therefore now behold all persons and see whether the things which the apostles prophesied of concerning the false teachers which should come , be not come to pass abundantly in the generations since their days , and also in this our age ; insomuch as the whole world hath been deceived by them , and led after them , and they have drawn them into many religions , sects , and opinions , and set them to kill and murder one another about religion , and about the scriptures , and about their worships and laws to compel men to them ; being all erred from the spirit , and from the truth , and now know not the truth , nor the spirit which was in the apostles and saints , in which spirit they worshipped God in their days ; and those then that got Christ's words , and the prophet's words , and had not his spirit ( but were arred from it ) and were out of the life , and out of the truth , which they did profess in words ; these i say the saints and true Christians , who were followers of Christ , and had his spirit , with it they tried the spirits of the other , who had it not ; and found them not to be of God , nor to be believed , nor received , but turned from ; for they were false spirits and false prophets which were gone out into the world from Christ , and from the saints , that had the spirit of God in them , by which they tried the other , and found them to be of the world , and antichrists in the spirit of this world , and by it led , which cometh from him who is called , the god of this world who had blinded their minds . and so they were not true prophets ( Or seers ) or true ministers of Christ , nor true teachers , but false teachers , false ministers , false prophets and antichrists , and blind guides gone out into the world , in the world's spirit , and so with that spirit they could not confess Christ come in the flesh , though in words they Might say he was come in the flesh ( As all the priests and professors who are called Christians , do now at this day in words confess him ) but not with the spirit confess him , as their fruits make it manifest . 

Now saith the apostle , hereby know ye the spirit of God . every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God ; and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ as come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of Antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come , and even now already is in the world . Ye are of God little children , and have over come them , because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world . They are of the world , therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them . We are of God , he that knoweth God heareth us : hereby know me the spirit of truth and the spirit of error , John 1.4 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6. verses . Now if those had not had Christ's words , and confessed him in words to be come in the flesh , ( While they were out of his life , and of another spirit ) than the apostle would not have called them antichrists , and prophets , and teachers , but he would have called them Jews , or gentiles , or heathers ; but this was it which did differ them from the Jews , and unbelieving gentiles , and heathers then ; namely , they had the words of Christ and the saints , and the prophets , and did profess them as the priests and teachers , and professors do now the scriptures , but are erred from the life of Christ , and from the spirit that was in the saints who gave forth the scriptures as they were then , whom John speaks of , erred from the life and spirit of Christ and the saints , and so were antichrists , and false prophets , and false teachers and deceivers , which were gone out into the world , from the saints life , and spirit , and so the world heard them , ( As they do now the priests and false teachers ) and they drew persons after them then , from the saints the true church , and so set up false churches and religions in the world , and false worships in imitation of the true church , and true religion , and true worship of God , which is in the spirit ; and so by this means deceived persons then at the first , and scattered them from God , and led them into confusion , and darkness , and disorder , and error , and so they broke out into many sects , and opinions , and religions , and ways of worship ; being once gone from the true worship , which is in the spirit of God alone , in which the unity is , & where this is wanting there cannot be unity , nor gathering unto God nor true worship of God : and so after the apostles decease , they being erred from the true spirit , who did profess themselves to be gatherers , could not gather unto God , but did draw persons more and more from God ; and so the whole world went after the false prophets and false teachers . 

and these were the grievous wolves which entered , and scattered the flock ; ( Which the apostle spoke of before which should come ) and Christ's words were fulfilled , who said , he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . so he that is not with Christ , but is against him , the same is Antichrist ; & he that gathereth not with him , but scattereth , there is the grievous wolf that scattereth the flock , and spoils the sheep of the Lord's pasture and makes havoc of them : and such are all they now at this day , who are called ministers , and have been accounted gatherers , and divines , and are called orthodox men ; but are found to be wolves in sheep's clothing , who do scatter the flock , and make havoc of the sheep of Christ , and spoil their goods , and cast into prison , and whip , and stock , and cut off ears , and wound , and hang , and banish , &c. and cause persons to hail them before magistrates , and stone , and beat them , & knock them down in streets for dead , and hail out of the synagogues , and steeple-houses , and reproach , and scoff , and scum , and speak all manner of evil falsely against them who are true Christians that not only confess Christ come in flesh in words , but also in works , and walk in that spirit which confelseth him come in the flesh ; who walk harmlessly , innocently , and righteously before all men , in meekness , in patience , in humility , in lowliness , in truth and uprightness before the Lord in all their dealing , and abide in Christ's doctrine , to speak the truth in all their communications , their yea to be yea , and their nay , nay ; who will not swear , nor lie , nor cozen , nor cheat , nor defraud their neighbours ; who are no fighters , nor quarellers , who resist not evil , but do good for evil , and pray for enemies , and bless them that curse them ; who are not in the envy , and hatred , and malice , and persecution , but are persecuted for righteousness sake ; who covets no man's silver nor gold , that are willing to deny themselves and their reputations in the world , and forsake the world's friendships to follow Christ , and suffer the loss of all for Christ's sake and the gospel . 

Now are not those grievous Wolus & antichrists that turn against such , and rent such , &c.  I say , are not these the grievous wolves that are entered ? and the antichrists that are gone out into the world ? And is there not now very many of them antichrists and wolves in sheep's clothing , among the professors , and the apostate Christians , or Antichristian , who are out of the life of Christ and the true Christians ? Such are not with Christ , but against him , and such gathereth not with him , but scattereth , and rents , and tears his lambs , and sheep , and persecutes Christ , and his church the true Christians , who are followers of him , and are gathered to him by his spirit in them . and if any man have not the spirit of Christ , he is none of his . now the antichrists who are gone out into the world , and the wolves come in sheep's clothing , who inwardly are ravening wolves ; these have not the spirit of Christ in them , nor are his , and so do turn against him and his ; and they are of another spirit , which their fruits do make manifest , whereby they May easily be known : the true Christians knew them so merly , and did bear their testimony against them ; so we know them now , and have , and do bear our testimony against them , for their fruits have appeared more plainly in this , then in any age since the arostles days . 

Therefore now come all ye priests , teachers , and professors in the world who are called Christians ; try yourselves , and examine yourselves , and see what spirit ye are of , who act these things before mentioned against the true Christians , and sheep of Christ , ( Who by you in scorn are called Quakers ) who hear his voice , and follow him ; and yet ye confess Christ in words to be come in the flesh : but what spirit is this in you , by which ye are led to act these things wherein ye are now found ? Is this the spirit of Christ , or the spirit of Antichrist gone out into the world , which lies in the wickedness , where there is many antichrists ? and the world hears them , for they are of its own ; but who are true Christians and followers of Christ Jesus , ( who is not of this world ) and are led by his spirit , these the world will not hear ; nay , the priests and professors therein , but cry against them , and speak all manner of evil against them falsely for Christ's sake ( By whose spirit they are gathered out of the world ) and say hang them , away with them , they are not fit to live upon the earth ; and so would murder , and kill , and destroy . By this we know that this spirit is not of God , nor doth confess Christ come in the flesh , but denies him who came not to kill , but to save men's lives ; and to destroy the devil , who was a murderer from the beginning ; and therefore we cannot believe that spirit , but deny it , and declare against it , to be that spirit of Antichrist gone out into the . World ; and the same spirit that was in the scribes , and Pharisees and Jews , who would have Jesus crucified , & Barrabbas released , ( Who was a robber ) for he was of their own spirit , and therefore they chused him before Jesus , who was of another spirit , and bore witness against them for their hypocrisy , and therefore they hated him . 

And so now , they that are of God , in the spirit of truth have tried this spirit , which the priests are in now , and have found it to be the spirit of error , which neither knoweth God , nor loveth him ; for he that loveth not , knoweth not God , for God is love : and so all who are found persecuting for conscience sake , and compelling men to swear , and to worship God in their ways which they have set up , and hating and envying of persons , and reviling and reproaching for matter of religion , and worship , &c. are found to be of that spirit which is not of God , which loves not nor knows not God , who is love ; but is of the devil , who was a murderer from the beginning , and a liar from the beginning , ( And the father of all liars , and murderers , and persecutors , and envious ones ) who is out of the truth , from whence all lies , and murder , and envy , and pride , and hatred , and persecution , and strife , and emulations , and enmity cometh , and all the deeds of darkness : and he is the god of the world , who hath blinded the minds of all men of the world that believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ , who is the image of God should shine in them . so he it is that makes persons dark , and blind , to work the works of darkness , and to act as blind men , where they are walking in the darkness , and love it , and put darkness for light , & call good evil , and evil good , and know not whither they go , nor know not the truth , nor the way of God , but persecute it , and call it error , and heresy ; as it was in all ages past , even so it is now ; for truth was never persecuted under the name of truth , but of error , and they who did persecute it , were always blind , & will be , for they are out of the truth , and therefore they know it not ; as the Jews did not know Christ , for if they had known him , they would not have crucified the Lord of life , ( Saith the apostle . ) So all the world's professors now are blind , ( Who do persecute ) they are all groping in the dark , as the men of Sodom did , who wearied themselves to find Lot's door , gen. 19.11 . And so it hath been in the world , in all their professions that hath be• since the days of the apostles , they have been fighting , and •••ing , and persecuting one another , and hating , and speaking evil one of another , and even wearied themselves by setting up of this form , and that form of worship , and making laws to compel to them ( Which they have called church discipline ) and by running from one way of worship to another , and from mountain to hill , and have been climbing till they are weary , and groping in the dark , till they are weary to find the door , and to find the true way , and yet they have not found it ; for the door is Christ , who saith , i am the door of the sheep ; all that ever went before me are thieves and robbers , John 10.7 . And again , i am the light of the world , &c.  

So friends and persons all , know this assuredly , that there is none ever comes to the door , to find the door , but who cometh to the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened them withal , and every one that cometh into the world , to wait in it , and believe in it , and be obedient to it ; for Christ saith , while ye have the light , believe in the light , that ye May be children of the light . so who are children of the light , they see , and are not blind , ( As the sodomites were , and as the professors now are , who believe not in the light of Christ . ) I say , they see the door , which is Christ , from whence the light comes , and enter in , and are his sheep , who know the true shepherd's voice ; but all who deny the light , and turn from it , and hate it , and speak against it , they are the children of darkness , who are unbelievers , that are without , the door is shut against them , and the light is their condemnation : so they are all walking in darkness , and wearying themselves , and groping , and cannot find the door , and so never come to enter in by it , nor to find rest for their souls , but are still without where the sodomites are ( Shut out of Lot's door , ) and without where the dogs , and unbelievers are , and where the whoremongers , and murderers , and liars are , and the unclean , and sorcerers , and the idolaters are , 22 rev. 15.  And so persons do weary themselves there , and spend their money for that which is not bread , and their labour for that which satisfies not ; but never comes to hearken diligently to the light of Christ Jesus in them , which reproves them for sin , that by it they Might be led out of sin , ( And out of Sodom and Egypt ) that their souls Might live and find rest , for the light leads to Christ , who gives rest to the soul . And till ye come to hearken diligently to the light , ye cannot know your souls to live , but still are the persons that are dead while ye live , and that have ears , and hear not , eyes , and see not , and hearts , and understand not ; and so are all as dead men , and blind men , and deaf men , and lame men , ( That cannot walk , and say none can keep Christ's commands ) and dumb men , and foolish men , without understanding in the things of God , which are spiritually discerned ; and without tasting , and feeling , and smelling , that cannot savour the things of God . And here are all the professions of the world , and their priests , and teachers , ( Even the highest of them all ) who denies that Christ Jesus hath enlightened every one with his true light , and tell persons its a natural light , and a delusion of Satan to draw them from it , and seduce them , and tells them it 's not sufficient to lead to salvation , &c.  I say they are all blind leaders who say so . 

And now persons , let me tell you who comes to the true light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened every one with that are come into the world , John 1.9 . and believe in it , and wait in it ( Which is true and spiritual ) it brings persons to spiritual seeing , and lets them see and discern the thoughts and intents of their hearts ; and who comes to believe in this light , and hearken diligently to it , they come to hear the voice of the son of God , and they that hear shall live ; so these are they that come out of death , and come to be made alive unto God ; then they are not dead men , nor deaf men , as the scripture saith , you hath he quickened , who were dead in your si•ts and trespasses ; and who comes to have their minds turned into the light of Christ Jesus in them , it will let them see the vanity of their minds ; this will unblind their minds which the god of this world hath blinded , see 2 cor. 4.3 . And bring them to see the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ , then will they not be blind men , who have eyes and see not , and ears and hear not , as the scripture saith , , i will give him for a covenant , for a light unto the gentiles , to open the blind eyes , &c.  and again saith Christ , buy of me eye salve that ye May see , and gold that ye May be rich , and white raiment that ye May be clothed , than ye will not be blind men nor naked . And who believes in the light of Christ ( Which is spiritual ) which Christ hath enlightened them withal , it will bring them to understand the things of God , and gives to discern them , and to know God . And this is it which reproves , and judgeth the deceit , and pride , and hypocrisy , and error in the heart , and the desperate wickedness in the heart , and the foolishness in the heart , and that which is contrary to God in the heart , and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart , and so brings persons to be of an understanding heart , and to discern the spiritual things of God , and not always to be of those that have hearts and understand not ; who are erred in their hearts , and know not the way of God , and are become vain in their imaginations , and by their foolish hearts are deceived . And again who come to the light , and wait in it , they come to taste and savour the things of God , and come to taste of the heavenly gist , and to taste of the word of God , and the power of the world to come , see heb. 6.3.5 . And they come to discern the things of God , from the things of the world , and come to discern between the spirit of God , and the spirit of the world , and come to have salt in themselves to savour withal , that which will season the heart ( Which is not to be trodden under men's feet ) for it is good to judge out that which hath corrupted the heart , and desiled it ; the light which shines in the heart , which hath no fellowship with darkness , nor with the works of darkness ; and so this will season it , and keep it cleah from corrupting , as every one minds it , and keeps to it , to love in , and believe in it , and obey it ; for there is nothing that is corrupt brought forth , but first is in the heart , for saith Christ , out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts , thefts , murders , adulter yes , uncleanness ; for that which goeth into the man doth not defile the man , but that which cometh out ; so every one whose minds be turned into the light of Christ , this will bring you to taste , and savour , and discern between the good and the evil , the light and the darkness , the precious and the vile , the holy and the profane , the clean and the unclean , the right hand and the left ; the sheep and the goats ; him that serveth God , and him that serveth him not , between the righteous and the wicked , between him that sweareth , and him that feareth an oath . So than ye will not put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; nor call evil good , nor good evil ; nor put bitter for sweet , not sweet for bitter ; nor call that which is corrupt holy ; nor the proud happy , as they did in former times ( Who wereblind ) and as they do now , who deny the light of Christ , and teach persons that it is but a natural light , &c.  these are they now who are blind , and without discerning , and tasting and savouring of the things of God ; and their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulnesle of sin , and they are without feeling . 

Now the light of Christ will let you see what is in your hearts , and in your minds , and in your thoughts , and what ye think , and what ye speak , for a good man ( Saith Christ ) out of the treasure of his heart , bringeth forth good things , and an evil man out of the treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil things ; now whose minds are turned to the light of Christ within , it will let you see what treasure you have in your hearts , and what ye do bring forth ; or whether ye be the good men which brings forth good things , good words , and good deeds , good desires , good motions , good thoughts , and good affections ; or whether ye be the evil men ( Who out of the evil treasure of your hearts ) brings forth the evil things , as evil thoughts , evil words , and evil deeds , &c.  this will let ye see whether the good things be there , or the evil things be there at all times ( If ye do mind it ) and show ye what ye bring forth , and what ye keep in secret , which ye would not have seen , for that is the evil doer , who doth not do truth , that would not have his work seen , and so doth not love the light because the light will reprove him ; but the good man who doth truth , he loves it , and brings his deeds to the light to be proved . And the light will let ye see if there be any deceit , or hypocrisy in your hearts , or desperate wickedness there , and it will reprove for that , and will search your hearts , and try your rains , and let you see what rules there , and what reigns there , in your hearts , and in your minds , and desires , and affections ; and whether ye have any rains to hold in your desires and affections , that they should not run into the lusts and vanities of the world , and of the flesh ; yea , or nay . And it will let ye see whether ye have the girdle of truth to gird up the loins of your minds to God ; or whether they are at liberty and loose , and tossed to and fro , as the raging sea , yea , or nay . And it will let ye see whether ye have a bit and bridle for your tongue , which otherwise will be unruly , and thereby you will offend , if ye use it as your own ; i say the light will discover this unto every one whose minds are turned to it , and wait in it , and who hearken diligently to it , and believe in it , and obey it ; they shall come to know their souls to live ; for obedience to it is life , and disobedience to it is death . 

And now whilst men who have been in power to govern the nations , have been making laws without to bind men's consciences , and to limit them , and compel them to this or that worship , and have been talking long of reformation and church-government , and have gathered-churches ( As they have called them ) and made leagues and covenants , and assemblies of divines ( So called ) to make confessions of faith , catechisms , and set-forms of worships ( As directoryes , &c. ) to worship God by , and to settle church-government , and have laws that all that would not worship God in such a way , and such a form as they had set up , to fine them , imprison them , and whip them , and stock them , and banish them , and hang them , or cut oft their ears , &c.  these have been the reformations in the world , in the apostasy , among the apostate Christians , since the days of the apostles  Among the Protestant's and Papists , with their laws , and statutes , and customs , and ordinances without , and carnal weapons , and goals , and whips , and houses of correction , and inquisitions , and fires , and faggots , and courts , and penance , and stools of repentance ( So called ) now all these things have been , and are in order to their reformation , and worshipping of God , and to bring persons to the kingdom of God . 

But now mind persons , what hath all this produced ? For they have all this while begun at the wrong end of the work , and their labour hath been in vain hitherto , and will be ; and little reformation hath been wrought among persons all this while , for many himdreds of years past , but one generation hath exceeded another in wickedness , pride and covetousness , drunkenness , uncleanness , deceit and hypocrisy , &c.  i say , what hath it brought forth , but to make persons hypocrites , not saints , false Christians , not true Christians ; and wolves in sheep's clothing ; to profess God and Christ in words , but in works to deny God ; and profess the scriptures to be their rule , and yet they are walking as contrary to that which they call their rule , as if they had no rule at all , nor no scripture at all , nor no law at all to bind them to this or that form of worship . 

These are but Babel's builders , whose work the Lord is comingto confound & throw down , & their languages is already confounded ; and they are all on heaps still ; after all their bustle and stir , which the many builders have made for many hundred of years about religion , and worship , and reformation ; and they are as far from the true worship as they were : and persons do not yet know the truth , nor the true worship of God which is in the spirit . and the Lord is seeking such to worship him , as worship him in the spirit , and in the truth , for God is a spirit . but all the world , teachers , and the priests , and professors therein , do not know the spirit of God , nor know not the truth year , and so were not like to worship God in it , or to find him in their outward worships , and carnal ordinances , and doctrines , and commandments , or in the outward observations and forms , which men have prescribed . Nay , God is a spirit , and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth . 

Now all this while persons have been erred from the spirit of God , and the wolf hath been covered with the sheep's clothing , and the wolves nature still retained and lived in , and not the sheep's nature . they have been all inwardly ravening wolves , and not in the true Christians nature , which is the divine nature , innocent and harmless , and separated from sinners . Now it hath been contrary in the world and is still ; they that depart from iniquity are made a prey of , and have been ; even the innocent and harmless sheep , and lambs of Christ have been rent and torn by the wolves , who did appear like sheep in the sheep's clothing , and had the saints words in their mouths , and have made havoc and spoil of their goods , and imprisoned their bodies , where the life of Christ hath been made manifest in any measure , which is the divine nature which the saints and true Christians were made partakers of , as ye May read in the scriptures : these i say have been made a prey upon , and persecuted in all ages , since the days of the apostles by the priests and professors , which doth appear , that though they have had the sheep's clothing on , yet they were inwardly ravening wolves , and by their fruits they are seen , and now do appear plainly in this our age and day , wherein never more profession hath been made since the days of the apostles , than now hath been of late years , and yet their fruits have been as bad as the worst ; even persecuting the innocent to death without cause , devouring of them , and making a prey of them , and accounting of them as sheep for the slaughter all the day long . 

These are not , nor never were the fruits of the true Christians , who were called sheep of Christ ; for it is contrary to their nature to persecute any , to whip or imprison any , to kill or destroy any , to bite and devour , and rend and tear to pieces like dogs and wolves ( As this generation hath done , of priests and professors ) but now this is not contrary to the wolf's nature to devour and rent and tear , nor contrary to their nature , who come in sheep's clothing for the fleece , and divine for money , and preach for hire , and their gain from their quarter , and for their filthy lucre , and for their bellies , it 's not contrary to these who are inwardly ravening wolves ; and these are the fruits by which ye May know them , and they are known now by all the lambs and sheep of Christ , who are his stock which he hath gathered from under their mouths , who do deny them ( Therefore they follow after them to devour them ) and these are children of light who do believe in the light of Christ , and follow him , and know his voice from the strangers ; for those who are in the wolf's nature are strangers to Christ , and alienated from his life , and erred from his spirit . and so whilst we were in the darkness , and in the alienation from the life of God and strangers to the covenant of promise ( As they are now ) than we did sollow them , and their voice was not strange to us , for we were one with them in the same nature , but than enemies in out minds to God , and without Christ , and without God in the world , but after that we came to believe in the light of Christ , and to hear Christ's voice , and to follow him , than we turned from the strangers , and would not hear them ( The priests ) any longer , for the children of the light see them , and bear testimony against them , but who are not yet come to the light of Christ in them they are still in the darkness , and in the night , and are in Babylon still , nor are not yet come to know a separation between the night and the day , the light and the darkness , truth and error , Christ's voice from the stranger's voice ; between the good shepherd's voice , and the thieves and robbers voice , who come not but to kill , and teale , and carry away , see , John 10.  And these come in the night , and so ye being in the nigh , cannot see them . now they that steal steal in the night , and these do rob and spoil ye , and dovour the widow's houses , and makes merchandise of your soul , and ye see them not , and so they kill and steal , and carry away undiscovered ; and make ye spend your money for that which is nor bread , and your labour for that which doth not satisfy ; and so keeps you always labouring and never satisfied , and always learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth , for who knows the truth , the truth sets them free , and gives them ease and rest from their burdens and labours , and peace , and satisfies their fouls ; but while persons are in the sins and divers lusts ( And your teachers tells you that ye must be there as long as ye are here upon earth ) you know not truth which sets free from sin , which loads and burdens the soul , and keeps it in death , where there is no peace , nor rest , nor satisfaction to it ; and so it cannot praise God , for its the living that praiseth God , the dead praiseth him not , nor they that go down to the pit . And so ye are all as a company of weak silly women , who are laden with sins and divers lusts , all in the transgression , and in the death , not a living man amongst you , to speak and to pray in your church ; but its the woman in the transgression , and so all is in the disorder and confusion , where the woman rules , and exerciseth authority over the man ( He that can receive this let him ) 

And thus ye have been , and are cheated , and deceived by the deceivers , which are come amongst you , the blind guides who leads you blind into the ditch , and ye love to have it so , and love the darkness , and will not come to the light , because your does be evil , least it should reprove them . and there you remain blind and weak under them uncured , for they are all physicians of no value . 

But now the children of the light sees them , how they do deceive , and cozen , and cheat you , and they declare against them , and they tell you of it , and show you plainly how , and wherein ye are deceived by them , and yet ye will not believe them , nor receive their testimony , and so if ye will be deceived , ye are like to be so ; and if ye perish , your destruction will be of yourselves , for the Lord will be clear of all your blood , and we shall be clear also , who have warned you to come out of Babylon , the mother of harlots , ( The false church ) and be separate from her , and touch no unclean thing , and the Lord will receive you ; but if ye be partakers of her sins , and trade with her merchants , and buy of their merchandise , ye will partake of her plagues that is coming upon her , and that speedily , and the time is at hand ; and the saints shall rejoice at her fall , when her judgement and torment shall come upon her ; but her merchants shall howl and mourn for her , for by her were they made rich . and these things are seen and made manifest to the children of light , glory , and honour , and living praises be unto the Lord for evermore : the hidden things of darkness is making manifest , and coming to be preached upon the house top , and all the hidden things of dishonesty comes to be laid open to the view of all men . for the day is come and coming , which reveals all things , and which will prove every man's work of what sort it is ; and every man shall receive a reward according to his deeds done in the body , whether they be good or evil . 

Therefore all persons , in whom there is any fear of the Lord , or any desire after the knowledge of his way , or any love to his truth , or to your soul's peace and welfare . It is high time for you to look about you and to consider your ways , what ye have beendoing , and what ye are doing , for the times of ignorance God hath winked at , but now he calls all men everywhere to repent ; for it is not a profession of the words now will serve you , without the possession of the life , for that will not be accepted of God . But all to repent and turn from the evil of your ways which ye have long been reproved for , by the light of Christ Jesus in you , which is God's witness in all your consciences , which otherwise will be your eternal condemnation , for your profession of Christ will not serve you , nor hide you ; nor your mountains , nor your hills where ye have been gotten up high , and looking for salvation from them , but it hath been all in vain . Come down from them to God's witness in you , and hearken to that , what that doth testify to you , for that is true and will not lie , nor deceive you , for that is of God , and leads to God . And with the Lord Jehovan alone is salvation , and with him is everlasting strength ; for those mountains will all fly away from you which ye now do trust in , and they shall not hide you from the face of the lamb , though ye May call to them to cover you , and to the rocks to fall upon you ; nay though ye seek death it shall fly from you . 

Therefore i say in time all be warned , and hearken diligently that your souls May live ; and away with all your false and deceitful coverings , which are but as so many fig-leaves sowed together to cover your nakedness : which will not endure long , and your profession will wither suddenly , and your nakedness will then appear more to your shame , then if ye had made no profession at all , to have that plucked off wherewith ye have been covered all this while , which made ye seem to be some body , when that is gone than ye will be naked , and as it were like no , and have nothing to cover your shame from the eyes of all ; for Christ Jesus disowns ye , who are workers of iniquity , and ye must depart from him , and not name his name . for it 's not every one that saith Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven , saith Christ . but while ye have been seeking to be justified by Christ , and yet lived in sin , and are found sinners ( Ye have not been doing the will of God ) for thereby ye would make Christ the minister of sin , who came to destroy sin , and the devil who is the author of it , and therein he did the will of the father , and plased him . and so as many as receive him and believe in his name , to them he gives power to become the sons of God , and to do his will in earth as it is done in heaven , which ye have been praying so long , and saying these words , but do not believe in your hearts that any shall ever attain to that here , which you pray for , therefore it 's not of faith , for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness , &c. and ye are not like to recelve that , which ye cannot believe ; so ye are not come to the measure of faith , even as a grain of mustardseed , for he that hath it , shall say unto this mountain be thou removed into the sea , and it shall be so , saith Christ ; but these are all parables , to all you professors in the world unknown , as it was to them to whom they were spoken then . But who comes to the light of Christ Jesus to believe in it , they read the parables , and they know the faith that removes the mountains and brings them down , and exalts the valleys , and makes the crooked ways straight , and the rough ways plain , and prepares the way of the Lord in the wilderness , and make straight paths for his feet , and such knows the kingdom of God to come , where his will is done on sarth , as in heaven , and where the daily bread is received , and sins forgiven , and enemies loved ; and Christ said to those that did not know nor believe , if i toll ye of earthly things , and ye cannot believe , how should you believe if i tell you of heavenly things ? John 3.12 . and again , i speak that which i have seen with my father , and ye speak that which ye have seen with your father , John 8.39 . 

Therefore all ye professors of the scriptures , and teachers of the prophets and Christ's words , and the words which ye have received by tradition from your fathers . it 's no wonder if the things declared of by the prophets , Christ , and the saints , be strange to you , that ye neither know them , nor can believe them , seeing ye me all erred from the spirit of the father , even that spirit which was in the prophets , Christ , and the apostles , and saints , which shows plainly of the father , and showed them things to come , which was , and now is the saints comforter , which Christ said he would send ; even the spirit of truth , which should lead them into all truth , and should bring all things to their remembrance . 

This the saints did receive in former times , by which they did plainly declare , what they had heard , and what they had seen , and tasted , and handled of the word of life ; and this the saints do now receive , even the same spirit of the father which was in the saints , and is now in the saints , and shall be in the saints to the end of the world , as Christ said ; by which the saints do now know the scriptures which were spoken forth by the spirit of God ( In the holy men of God ) and understand them , and witness the thing they speak of ; so that they are not a book sealed to us , nor parables to us , who come to enjoy the things they speak of , which is freely given to us of God , as they were to them who spoke forth the scriptures , as the apostle said , 1 cor. 2.11 , 12 , 13.  We have not received the spirit of this world , but we have received the spirit which is of God , by which we know the things which are freely given to us of God ; which things we declare in the plain demonstration of the spirit , and not with words which man's wisdom teacheth , comparing spiritual things with spiritual . But the natural man perceiveth not the things of God , for they are foolishness to him , neither can he receive them , because they are spiritually discerned . and so with this spirit which we have received of God the father , & the father of our Lord Jesus Christ , doe-we speaks of the things of God , which we have seen with him ; by which spirit the saints are now led to declare forth the truth to the world as it is revealed in them from the father of spirits , as the children of God did formerly by the same spirit , who said , as many as are the sons of God , the same are led by the spirit of God . and so now it is , as every one hath received the gift of the father , so to minister to others ; and according to the ability which God hath given , from whence every good and perfect gift doth come , from the father of lights , with whom is no variableness , nor shadow of turning . And this we know and declare , that if any man have not the spirit of Christ , he is none of his , which is the gift of the father's love , and he that hath it , hath received it freely from the father , from whence every good and perfect gift doth come : mark ! Who receives a gift from God , they receive that which is perfect , that which is heavenly , that which is free , and that which comes from the father of lights , and so with that they see , and know , and can freely declare of the things of God , of the heavenly things , of that which is perfect , of that which is holy , of that which is true , of that which sins not , of that which is born of God , which overcomes the world , as the saints did of old , who said , hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his spirit , 1 John 4.13 . No otherwise can any one know him now truly , but by his spirit , which quickens , and makes alive unto God : for it is life eternal to know these the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent , saith the saints ; and herein is our love made perfect , that we May have boldness in the day of the Lord ; for as he is , so are we in this present world . And we know that the son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , and we know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life ; and this we have not of ourselves , but this we have freely received from God , ( As the saints had ) and this we freely declare , and testify to the world as they did , that so others Might come to receive of the same from him , in whom the fullness of the godhead dwells , of whose fullness have we all recelved , and grace for grace . and so we have nothing to boast of , or glory in of ourselves , for it is by grace , which is the free gift of God , that we are what we are ; that no flesh Might glory in his sight , but that all the honour , and the praise , and the glory Might be given unto God alone , from whence every good , and perfect gift cometh . 

And now oh all ye priests , and teachers , and professors , unto whom these things seems strange , which we declare of ; so that ye cannot believe them , but get up into rage , and envy against us to persecute and reproach us , and speak all manner of evil falsely against us , as your forefathers did ( The scribes and Pharisees , who were hypocrites ) against Christ and the saints in former times , who did declare of those things then , which the blind guides did not know , nor could believe , and therefore did they persecute them , and hail them before magistrates , and cast them into prisons , and put them to death , though the things which the saints did declare were true , and the same which Moses and the prophets , the holy men of God had declared of , which should come to pass , and so did come to pass according to their words : yet now the scribes , and Pharisees , and Jews , who had the words of Moses and the prophets , and were the greatest professors of religion then that were in the world ; they having the words , but being out of the power , out of the life of Abraham , and Moses , and the prophets that declared those things by the spirit of God ; these i say ( Being erred from the spirit ) did not know the things which the holy men of God did foretell of to come . The holy thing which was to be born , which is called the son of the living God , and when he was come , they did unto him as they listed , & crucified the Lord of life , because they knew him not . though they said they were Abraham's children , and knew God , and were Moses disciple , and were called Jews , and rested in the law , and made their boasts of God , and that they knew his will , and did approve of the things that are more excellent , and were confident that they themselves were guides to the blind , and a light to them that are in darkness , and instructors of the foolish , and teachers of babes , which had the form of knowledge , and of the truth in the law . thou therefore ( Saith the apostle ) that teachest another , teachest thou not thyself , &c.  All these were untaught themselves , though they were teachers of the law , they were transgressors of the law , and when Christ Jesus came , who was the substance , the holy seed , the end of the law , who fullfilled it , and brought in everlasting righteousness , who was the way to God , the truth and the life , they knew him not , but slew him ; ( And so it is at this day , the professors of the world , who only have ) the name of Christians , persecute them that are in the true Christians life and nature ) for they were blind leaders of the blind ; ( As Christ told them ) and that they were of their father the devil , who was a liar , and a murderer from the beginning , for whom God hath sent , him ye believe not , but seek to kill him : and so though they had the true men's words , and the righteous men's words , and the just men's words , yet they were erred from their spirit , and therefore they knew not the just and righteous one , and holy one of Israel , but were in the murderous spirit , and in the lying spirit , which is of the devil , who did not abide in the truth ; and in the envious spirit , and in the persecuting spirit , which is not of God , ( As all ye priests and professors are found in at this day , ) which spirit i say is not of God , nor received of God , for the fruits of God's spirit is love , meekness , gentleness , patience , long-suffering , charity , &c.  but the fruits of your spirit is the contrary , as the fruits of theirs was coutrary , who persecuted the saints in former times , as the scriptures declares , and plainly makes manifest . 

And so now ye come to be tried , and seen , and manifest , and declared against , by the same spirit as was in the saints formerly , and the testimony thereof we know is true , and your deceit and hypocrisy comes to be laid open , as theirs were , whom ye have been crying against for many years , ( The scribes , and Pharisees , and Jews , who crucified Christ , and killed the saints , and prophets ) and have been envying against them , ( And have a law made that none of the Jews should come into this nation , &c. ) and speak against them , as they did against the false prophets , and their forefathers that slew the true prophets , and said , if they had been in the days of their forefathers , they would not have done so ; but Christ told them not withstanding , that they were the children of them that killed the prophets , and they built their tombs , and garnished the sepulchers of the righteous ; and he called them , whited walls , and painted sepulchers , and serpents , and a generation of vipers , &c.  

Therefore come now ye professors , and teachers , and priests , own your forefathers , the scribes , and Pharisees , and Jews , which are gone before you , whom ye have cried against , and said , ye would not have done as they did ; and yet have ye not done , and are doing many of the same things as they did , in persecuting of the righteous ; for now have ye not slain the prophet in you which Moses spoke of , saying , like unto me will the Lord raise up a prophet in the midst of you , him ye shall hear in all things , &c.  and are ye not slaying , and persecuring the righteous , and killing the just , who doth not resist you ; and are painting and garnishing the sepulchers , and building the tombs of the prophet , and of the righteous ? And are in your fair outside worships , ( As they were ) to be seen of men ; and crying 〈◊〉 this form , and the other form of church government ; and this ordinance , and the other ordinance ; and this way of worship , and the other way of worship ; and crying up this learned man , and the other rabbi , and are in your observations , as they were ; and have set up the Jews tithes , ( Which were to the first priesthood ) and so deny Christ Jesus the second priesthood ; and have set up sacraments , and Sabbaths , and schools , and colleges , and churches , ( Which God never commanded ) and giving them saints names , as the Papists do , and call the Papists old masse-houses churches , and so are crying up dead things , and dead names , and ordinances of men , and doctrines of men , and things which May be touched , tasted , and handled , which all perish with the using . 

And by these things have ye kept persons in the death , while they have seemed to live , and have made a great stir and bustle in the world for many hundred of years , by crying them up , and setting them up ; and your ministry or ministers as the oracles of God , and the maintenance for them , and have killed some for witnessing against these things , and have been ready to kill one another about these things , and could not agree about them ; and one hath built a wall , and another hath daubed with untempered mortar , and so have been daubing and daubing to keep it up from falling , and whiteing of it to make it appear beautiful to please men , and to be seen of men : and all this invented worship and imitations which ye have set up , and brought persons into , are but as so many tombs and sepulchers of the righteous ; and these have been cried up by the priests for divine institutions , and orthodox , and canonical , and whiteed over with large pretences , and plausible arguments , and undeniable consequences , ( As they have called them ) and the poor persons have received all this for gospel , and ordinances of Christ , and of his church , as if Christ had been there present , ( Who is the true prophet , and the righteous seed which the promise is to ) when as there was nothing but tombs , and sepulchers of the prophets and of the righteous which they had garnished . And so persons while ye have been in these things , ye have been all in the darkness and in the death , and have been all as graves which men go over unawares , being erred from the spirit which quickens and makes alive ; which spirit was in the prophets , by which they prophesied and declared forth the truth , which came to pass accordingly to the Jews , that in seeing they should see , and not perceive , and in hearing they should hear , but not understand , which also is come to pass in these our days , among all the teachers and professors who have been thus daubing , and building , and painting the tombs and sepulchers , and whiteing the walls ; the just hath been killed , and he hath not resisted you , and the prophet lies slain in you all , and ye understand not , nor hear him , nor see him , neither have perceived , nor known his voice , who is the true light that lighteth every one , that all in the light Might believe him whom Moses said was like unto him , whom the Lord would raise up a prophet from the midst of them , whom ye should hear in all things : and it shall come to pass , saith he , that whosoever will not hearken unto this prophet , shall be cut off from amongst the persons . and so Moses saw and declared of concerning Christ , that which ye do not know , nor see , nor hear , though ye have long been talking of him , and naming of his name ; but it was but death speaking of the fame of wisdom , because ye have been erred from his Spirir , which is the spirit of truth , which convinceth the world of sin , and reproves them for sin ; but this the world cannot receive , which doth reprove them for their sins and evil deeds , because they love their sins and evil deeds , and not God ; now they that love the Lord hate evil , but he that loves not God , nor receives the light of Christ , nor believes in it , ( Which is the true prophet , and faithful witness of God ) he loves his evil deeds , but hates the light which reproves him for his sins , and evil deeds , and therefore the light is his condemnation , as Christ saith ; and so this is not their comforter , who believe not but love their evil deeds ; but this is he whom we have received and followed , ( even Christ Jesus who is come a light into the world ) and denied ourselves , and our own wills for him , and taken up his cross , and we know the prophet raised the spirit of truth come , which is our comforter in all our troubles , and leads us into all truth , and brings all things to our remembrance and knowledge , which were spoken before by the prophets , Christ , and the saints , which spirit is in us , which was made manifest in the flesh , and dwelled amongst the saints , and they saw his glory , who was the begotten son of God , and did hear testimony of him , who said unto them who believed in him , i will pray the father , and he shall give you another comforter , that he May abide with you for ever : even the spirit of truth , whom the world cannot receive : mark ! because it seath him not , neither knoweth him ; but ye know him , for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you , ( Joh. 14.16 , 17. ) and now is in all his saints , and so he did come to them according to his promise , acts 1.4 . And he doth come again to all that wait for him in the manifestation of his spirit , which is given to every one to profit withal , which is the true light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world withal , that all through the Ligh Might believe , and follow the light , and not walk in darkness , but Might come to have the light of life , and Might come to Christ from whence the light comes . 

But now all ye who have set yourselves against the light , and denied it to be sufficient to lead to Christ , and say it 's natural , and so have kept persons from it , are the seducers which John speaks of , 1 joh. 2.26 . Ye are still in darkness , and walking in darkness , and following your own spirits , and have seen nothing , who have prophesied lies in the name of the Lord , and have been walking in the light of the fire , and of the sparks of your own kindling ; but you shall lie down in sorrow , for that will not bring you to Christ , neither hath , nor to his life , whose life is the light of men , with which he hath enlightened them that they Might believe in it , and follow him ; and so with this they know him , and hear him , and deny you , who are strangers , and hear him not , nor know him , nor receive him , and so have not power , but are crying out ye want power , and the reason is , because ye receive him nor , nor believe in his name , who gives power to become the sons of God ; and yet are professing his name , and asking , and preaching , and praying , and baptising in his name , but none of you are baptised yet into his name , who depart not from iniquity , though ye have been crying , Lord , Lord , we have eaten , and drunken in thy presence , &c.  who have had a form of godliness , but denied the power , which was before the form , and is without form , and is the substance which shall stand , when all your forms shall end . And so ye know not the life , the power , the substance , the holy seed which is come , who stands , and remains , and abides , and lives for ever , ye are all out of that , and strangers to it : but ye are in that which ends , out of the truth , who denies the power , and life , but retains the form , and have a show of wisdom in your will-worships , and voluntary humility , intruding into those things ye have not seen , being vainly rufft up by your fleshly minds , having a form and shadows of things to come , but the body which is Christ , ( Who is the life and substance ) hath been wanting amongst you , who have been making a large profession of Christ and of the gospel , and had a form , but the substance being wanting , which is the life and power , which ye are all our of , and therefore ye do not know Christ , nor the gospel , for it is the four of God unto salvation , to every one that believes : but many have had that which ye have called the gospel , ( Namely the four books of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . ) and yet want this power , and know nothing of it , but say they want power to do what they should do , and aught to do ; and this is the farthest that any of them can come , and there they are still in the weakness in the flesh , ferred from the spirit , and cry out they want power , which is the gospel , and so want peace and want salvation to their souls , for the gospel is still hide from them , which is the power of God which saves the soul . 

So the gospel had need to be preached to you all again , ye priests and teachers and profestors , for it is hide from you , and ye are all in the lost state , seeing ye are all erred from the spirit , by which it was preached , ( And is preached ) which proceeeds from the father , and came down from heaven , and so it is hide from you , you want it , ye have lost it , lost the power , but retained a form in the long night of apostasy , since the days of the apostles , and have been erred from the faith , which was once delivered to the saints , which stood not in the wisdom of words , but in the power of God ; but the power you want , and so the faith ye have lost , and erred from it , and it hath been so long wanting among you , that ye do not know it , what it is ; for it is a mystery held in a pure conscience : and ye have been in the night all this while , ( And are still ) and have been eating and drinking with the drunken , and beating your fellow-servants , and have said in your hearts , the Lord deferreth his coming , ( Who hath been in a far country from you , and ye have not known where he hath been , for the manchild hath been caught up unto God ) but he is come and coming upon you as a thief in the night , and ye do not see him , because ye have not watched for his coming , but have been asleep in sin , and have been careless , and thought yourselves secure as if all had been well with you , and said none can be free from sin here , &c.  and now behold the son of man is come , he doth not find faith in the earth , as Christ said , when the son of man cometh , shall be find faith in the earth ? 

And now the day of the Lord is come , and coming , wherein every man's work shall be tried of what sort it is , and truth shall now be known from error and deceit ; i say the dayspring from on high hath now again visited us after the long time of darkness which hath been over the earth ; yea such a time hath been , that the darkness hath been so great , that it Might be felt , that none could rise from the place where they sat , and is yet upon many peoples , and nations , and kindreds , and tongues , as it was in Egypt of old , ( See exed . 10.21 , 22. ) so it is now , and hath been in spiritual Egypt , where also our Lord Jesus Christ hath been crucified . 

And so his gospel is again to be preached unto all nations , kindreds , and tongues , and persons , whom God hath given for a covenant , for a light unto the gentiles , to open the blind eyes , and to bring the prisoner out of prison , and them that have sat in darkness out of the prison-house . for persons have sat in darkness , and have taken up their seat there , and the priests have laboured to keep them there , and have been crying out against new-lights , and calling it heresy , and getting laws made to keep out all new-light ( As they called it ) to keep out truth from being known any more than it was , and so have made a covenant with death , and an agreement with hell , and to keep persons in the death , and in the darkness , and error ( Which they called light and truth ) and none must remove from the place where he sat in darkness , and in the shadow of death ; this hath been the priests work for many years past to keep persons there , in spiritual Egypt , and darkness ; so the leaders of the persons have caused them to err , and they have told persons that these laws were the discipline of the church , to keep out error , and to preserve the gospel , and to keep heresy from spreading : now this hath been their cry and their pretence whilst they have been keeping out truth thereby , and limiting the spirit of God to this or that form , so that truth hath not had its liberty , which is only able to keep persons from error and heresy . 

And what error , and heresy , and wickedness is there that can be named , that is not amongst them ? And you ( Oh ye priests and teachers notwithstanding all your outward laws ) who have had all these fair pretences to keep up your forms of worships without the power , even by your outward laws , and carnal weapons , as stocks , and whips , and prisons , and courts , and leagues , and covenants , and oaths , and protestations , and assemblies of divines , ( So called ) and confessions of faith , and directories to worship by , &c.  all this hath been but to hold up your trade to preach for hire and filthy lucre , and for your bellies , and to bear rule by your means over the persons , and to keep them still in the house of bondage , and darkness , in Egypt , to labour in the brick , and so have been as the taskmasters over them , who would have their tale of brick , and would allow them no straw ; but they must go abroad to get it , and so have oppressed the persons , and have been cruel , so that ye have made them to groan under their burdens , and there was none to help them . And now the Lord hath heard their cry , and is risen , and come to deliver his persons from under you , even from under the mouths of such devouring wolves , who have made a prey upon them ; and have cried peace to persons in their sins and wickedness , and have had men's persons in admiration because of advantage , and have kept and do keep many there . 

Now ye that have done so , have not been the ministers of Christ , but of Antichrist ; not of righteousness , but of unrighteousness , and messengers of Satan ; though ye have transformed yourselves into several forms and shapes , but your end is seen , and your reward will be according to your work ; for though the strong man armed have kept the palace , and so the things therein hath been in peace , yet now a stronger than he is come ( who is in us ) even stronger than he who is in the world ; and this is he whom we preach , Christ Jesus the true light , who hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world , which convinceth them of sin , and reproves for sin , and speaks not peace to them there , but sends a sword to take it away , and leads them out of sin who believes and obeys him ; and this is he who saves his persons from their sins , and destroys the work of the devil . 

And he is come and appeared in his servants and ministers , as of old ; to call sinners to repentance , and to turn from sin unto God , and from the darkness to the light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that so they Might receive remission of sins , and an inheritance amongst them that are sanctified ; which many who have been turned , and are turned ( By them ) can witness the inheritance , and an entrance into it ; glory be unto the Lord God of heaven and earth for ever . 

Therefore do i exhort and warn every one of you in the fear of the Lord , to turn in your minds to the light of Christ Jesus within you ; who is given for a light to the gentiles , and for a new covenant to the house of Israel , where the law is written in the heart , that so ye May come to read there what is in your hearts , to know good from evil , and the just from the unjust , and truth from error ; the right way from the wrong ; for the light will show you if your minds be turned to it . for the law is light saith Solomon , and it is a light unto my feet , and a lamp unto my paths , saith David ; and again he saith , the law of the Lord is perfect , converting the soul ; the testimony of the Lord is sure , making wise the simple ; the statutes of the Lord are right , rejoicing the heart ; the commandments of the Lord is pure , enlightening the eyes : the fear of the Lord is clean , and endureth for ever ; the judgements of the Lord are true , and righteous altogether ; by them thy servant is forwarned , and in keeping of them there is great reward . and again saith he , oh how do i love thy law , it is my delight , it is my meditation day and night ; whereby he became witer than all his enemies , and more understanding than all his teachers . And this is it which gives the knowledge of sin , and convinceth of sin , and reproves the world for sin , and condemneth for sin them that believe not . and this law is spiritual , holy , just , and good ; and this will let you see , that ye are carnal , sold under sin , and found in the sin and transgression of it , and in the corruption , whilst ye have been promising of yourselves liberty and saying ye are justified by Christ ( and so would have made him the minister of sin , gal. 2.17 . ) while yet ye are under the law , and the law hath dominion over you , and condemns you for your sins , and evil deeds ; as the apostle saith , know ye not , for i speak to them that know the law , how that the law hath dominion ever a man so long at he •••eth . for Paul saith rom. 7.  i was alive without the law once , but when the commandment came sin revived , and i died ; that slew him , and so that which was ordained unto life , became death unto him ; he being in the transgression of it ; and so dying unto sin he was dead to the law , not under it , for than he faith , i through the law am dead to the law , but alive unto God ; so that which slew him , and made him dead unto sin , brought him unto Christ Jesus who is the life , the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes ; so the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ , saith he , gal. 3.24 . So who are come to Christ they are come out of the transgression , they are come to live unto God , they are come to Christ who sulalls it , who is the way , the truth , and the life , and they are not under the law but under grace . For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ . 

And now ( to the witness of God in you all do i speak , who have long been professing Christ , and justification by him , &c. ) To turn in to the light which is God's witness , and with it try yourselves , and examine yourselves truly and honestly ; and it will let you all see that ye are not come to Christ yet , nor yet known him , who is the end of the law for righteousness , who fulfillls it ; but ye are under it still , alive without the law , unslain by it ( As Paul was ) in the sin and transgression , and so not justisied by Christ , neither know him : all ye who do deny the light which he hath enlightened ye withal ; for none comes to know him , but who believes in the light which Christ hath enlightened them withal ; nor none come into the righteousness which is the end of the law , and fulals it ; but who believe in the light and are obedient to the light , and walk in it : here is the righteousness known , which exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees who should in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven , who had the law without , and read it every Sabbath day , but they were sayers and not doers , and hypocrites of whom Christ said , go not after them , for they had the form , but not the power ; they had a show of righteousness , and made clean the outside , but the inside was unclean , and unrighteous , and were but as whited walls and painted sepulchers , which did appear beautiful and righteous before men , but within were no••ing but rottenness and deads' men's bones , and so were as graves which men go over unawares , and what they did it was to be seen of men , and thereby did beguile , and deceive the hearts of the simple , and so shut the kingdom of heaven against men ( As Christ said ) and neither entered in themselves , nor suffered others that were entering . 

Now are not all ye teachers , priests , and professors found here in the Pharisees spirit , and in the same generation with them , in outward shows of holiness and righteousness , and forms of godliness , and making clean the outsides , as they did , and saying , and are Sayers as they were , but not doers , and so are hypocrites as they were . And ye keep persons always saying , but never bring them to do what they say ; but teach them that Christ hath done all for them , and if they can but believe that , than they are well enough ; and so blinds persons by that means , that they do not mind what they do themselves , nor what they say to perform , and so are out of the truth , and never come to the knowledge of it , and so the kingdom of heaven is shut against you and them , and so you are ever teaching them , and they are ever learning , and saying after you ; and so make a fair show in the flesh , and appear to be something outwardly , and persuade them that they are justified by the righteousness of Christ , which he hath wrought for them without , and so there they rest as the Pharisees did in the outward observations , whilst in the mean time , they are inwardly unclean , their hearts unclean , their minds defiled , their eyes full of adultery , who cannot cease from sin , and so are shut out of the kingdom , into which no unrighteous thing , or unclean thing must ever enter ; and are but as tombs garnished , and sepulchers painted ( Wherein is rottenness , and dead men's bones ) mark ! like the scribes and Pharisees , and so your righteousness doth not exceed theirs . In the same generation with them are ye , and their children are ye , who slew Christ Jesus the true prophet , which Moses spoke of , when he said , like unto me will the Lord raise up a prophet , which all were to hear , &c. as the Pharisees were the children of them that slew the prophets that went before them , and are like unto them . And are still slaying , and have been slaying , and killing , and persecuting , and hailing before magistrates , and out of the synagogues as they did , those who are the true Chriftians , in whom the spirit of Christ is manifest , who bear witness against your hypocrisy and deceit now , as Christ did , and the true Christians did in the primitive times ; and it is your srultes makes ye manifest now , as theirs did then : and your fair sayings , and not doing now cannot cover you , no more than that could cover the Pharisees then , who said , and did not ; and therefore Christ calls them hypocrites . Moreover , as they would not hear him of whom the father said , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased , hear ye him ; and of whom John bore witness and said , he was the true light , that lighteth every man that cometh into the world . and so because they did not believe in the true light , therefore they were blind leaders of the blind ; and so it is , and hath been with you , who do not believe in the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withal , but speak against it , and say it is insufficient and natural , &c.  Therefore ye abide in darkness , and are children of darkness , who know not whither ye go , nor know not that ye are walking in the steps of your forefathers the scribes and Pharisees , who were hypocrites and blind guides , who persecuted Christ , and put him to death , and persecuted the saints ( the true church ) and halled them before magistrates , and shut them up in prisous , and thought they did God good service in so doing ; even so it is now with many of you at this day ye think so , who walk in darkness , and know not whither ye go ; but the children of the light who believe in the light , they see the true way which is Christ , and with the light they see you all where you are in the false ways , in the way of the Pharisees ( and not in the way Christ ) and bear witness against you now , as the saints did then against them . And ye can no longer be hide , but your folly will come to be laid open , and manifest more and more , so that ye cannot proceed much further . 

For now is the day dawning , and the day-starr arising in the hearts of many persons , who take head unto the more sure mord of prophecy , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place ; and such as do so , do well ; and when the day-starr doth arise , the sun is near approaching which expels all the darkness , that men comes to see round about them ; and then they can see what the holy men of God did , and what Christ and the saints did , and what the scribes and Pharisees did , and so see over the apostasy to the apostles days ; and what the apostate Christians have been doing since the apostles days , and what they are still doing , and what the saints the true Christians are now doing , and who are they ; and can know them who have done well , and who now do well , from them that have done evil , and now do evil ; for the day is that , which tries every man's work of what sort it is . And all who are come to the day now , can see beyond the night of the apostasy , and over it , and what was before it , and what hath been since in it , among the apostate Christians since the apostles days ; that persons have been in the darkness and night , who have not seen the true way , nor known whither they have been going . but now unto all that fear my name shall the sun of righteoususse arise with healing in his wings , saith the Lord . For who comes to take heed unto the light which shines in the dark place , they do well ; and who comes to do well , they come to be healed , and to know the sun of righteousness to arise from whence the light comes , and they are those who do righteously , and truly , and honestly , and walk as in the day time , and to put off unrighteousness , and the works of darkness , and fleshly lusts which war against the souls . for that is it which hath wounded the soul , even the fleshly lusts that wars against it : now the light which shines in the heart leads from the fleshly lusts , and out of them to Christ Jesus the sun of righteousness , who ariseth with healing . for as the unrighteousness , and works of darkness is put off , and the fieshly lusts abstained from , which wars against the soul and wounds it ; so Christ Jesus the sun of righteousness ariseth , and is put on , who heals and binds up the wounds , and powers in wine and oil thereinto , who is the good Samaritan , who is better than the priest , and the Levite , who passed by like strangers , and left the man half dead , who had fallen among thieves and robbers , among his enemies , and was wounded ; as the hirelings priests do now , who are strangers that pass by , and leave many wounded , and as it were half dead ; and instead of helping of them , are rather the thieves that rob , and wound , and murder , and kill . for , saith Christ , the hyroling cometh not but for to kill , and to steal , and to destroy , neither careth he for the sheep , but for the fleece , and for his tithes ; as the priests and Levites did , who passed by . And again , saith the prophet , as atrope of robbers wait for a man , so do a company of priests further in the way by consent . and these things have been seen , and are as plainly fulfilled , and manifested amongst this generation of priests , and teachers , and professors , as in any age of the world . Nay it will be more tolerable for those that went before , then for these , even the scribes and Pharisees , who perfecuted the saints , and put Christ to death ( whom they did not know that it was he that should come , as the scripture saith , if they had known they would not have crucified the Lord of life ) but these say they believe that he is come , and profess they know him , and yet persecute him , where ever he is made manifest in sons , or daughters , and cast him into prison , &c.  now the fewes and Pharisees were under another priesthood which God had commanded , and so had a righteousness there according to the law of Moses outwardly , which mey sought to establish , and so could not own Christ Jesus , the second priesthood , who is God's righteousness , nor submit unto it , and so were rejected . 

But now the priests and professors and apostare Christians they do confess Christ Jesus comain the flesh ( in words ) who is the second priesthood , who is God's righteousness , and do deny the Jews & Rharisees and yet they set up another priesthood , which is contrary to Christ , and contrary to the Jews , which God never commanded ; and they take tithes , and stipends , and augmentations , and gleabe-lands , &c. and seek to set up a righteousness without them to be justried by ( which they call the righteousness of Christ ) while they are in the unrighteousness themselves , and in the sin , and transgression of the law of God , and so have not submitted to the righteousness which is of God by faith in Christ Jesus , no more than the Jews did ; therefore this is but their own righteousness ( which is but as filthy rags ) and Antichrist in the likeness of Christ , and Antichristian and apostates , in the likeneste of true Christians . For this is but their own inventions , and their own righteousness ( which inderd is not worthy to be called righteousnesses , where they are puffed up in their fleshly minds ) which they go about to establish , whilst they are disobedient to him who is the righteousness of God , and was made manifest in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for , sin condemned sin in the flesh , that the righteousness of the law Might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the spirit . 

Now there is none ever cometh to the righteousness of God , and to have the righteousness of the law fulfilled in them , and to walk after the spirit , but who come to believe in the light of Christ in their own particulars , and obey it ; which convinceth of sin , and reproves for sin , and condemns sin in the flesh ; who do so they walk not after the flesh , they come our of the weakness ; for the law was weak through the flesh , or they come to feel the power , and the operation of the spirit , which makes free from the law of sin , and death ; which the law could not do because it was weak through the flesh : but now God hath sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin condemned sin , in the flesh , that the righteousness of the law Might be fulfilled in us ( say the saints ) who walk not after the flesh , but after the spirit . and this law of the spirit of life , which condemns sin in thee , and makes free from the law of sin and death , and is in Christ Jesus ; and this is the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened every one with that cometh into the world , and is a manifestation of the spirit which is given to every one to profit withal his which is sent into the world to convince the world of sin , and to reprove for sin ; and will be , the condemnation of all the world who believe not in it , but dirobey it , and hate it , and love their evil deeds , and their sins which it doth reprove them for ; so that it is not their comforter , but their reprover and condemner that do not receive it , and love it not , but reject it . But it is the comforter of all those who do receive and love is , and believe and obey it , and are led by it ; for it leads into all truth , and sets free from sin and death , and hears witness with their spirits , that they are the sons of God ; for as many as are led by the spirit of God , the same are the sons of God . this the saints did bear witness of in former times , and this the saints do , witness now , glory and honour and living praises be unto the Lord God of heaven and earth for evermore . 

But this is a mystery to the world , and hide from all the apostate Christians in it ; of what sect , or opinion , or judgement , or religion soever they be of , who deny the light which Christ Jesus bath lighted every one withal to be •ufficient to lead to salvation , 〈◊〉 . I say , they know not that which makes free from sin and death , and brings to life ; no can they believe that , when it is declared to them ; but say none can be free from sin on this fide of the grave ; and account it error to say that any can be free from sin here , or be righteous here without sin ; and say the most righteous man sins , and he that is born of God sin ( which is blasphemy so to say ) and this is , and hath been their doctrine in the world , amongst the priests and profelsors , the antichrists and Anrichristians , who are out of the life of Christ , and the true Christians that now their nakedness appears to thein shame , because they have not submitted to the righteousness by faith in Christ Jesus that they Might be covered with it , who is the true light ; to believe in the light , that by it they Might be led unto Christ Jesus from whence it comes , who is God's righteousness , and thereby know the righteousness of the law fulfilled in them , and know the kingdom of god within , which cometh not with observation , as Christ saith , and the righreousness in which it stands , and the power in which it stands is within ; and the law of the spirit , which makes free from the law of sin and death , and the life which is eternal , which is the gist of God through Jesus Christ , in whom the law of the spirit of life is . but now all who are pleading for sin , and say , none be free from sin here , they are still under the law of sin and death , ( which Paul said he was made free from ) sin is still a law to them , and they are servants to it , and so they are free from righteousness , as the apostle said ; while ye were servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness ; but being made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness : that at sin had reigned unto death , so righteousness Might reign unto life through Jesus Christ our Lord . and again ; his servants ye are whom ye obey , whether sin unto death , or obedience unto righteousness . 

Therefore come all ye teachers and professors of the world , what say you ? Can none be made free from sin and death here , while he is upon earth ? what is there not a living man amongst you all who is quickened ? is there none of you come up out of the grave that can truly say , oh death , where is thy sting ? Oh grave , where is thy victory ? Thanks be to God , who hath given me victory over death ? what are you all as graves which men go over unawares ? have none of you heard the voice of the son of God yet , which they that hear shall live ? are you all dead in your sins and trespasses , unquickned yet , in the fall , in the first Adam's state , in the disobedience , by which sin entare dinto the world , and death by sin ? Are you all there still where death reigns ? Is there none come to life , which is through the obedience to Christ Jesus , the second Adam , the quickening spirit , the Lord from heaven ? Have none of you the word of God abiding in you , which word is quick , and powerful , and the entrance of it gives life ? Come forth and answer for yourselves ; what are you all shur up in the unbelief until this day , and have not believed in him whom God hath sent , who is the resurrection and the life , ( Who saith ) he that believeth in me shall live for ever , he shall never die ; for he hath life in himself , and he gives life to every one that believeth ; what are you all searching the scriptures which testifies of Christ , and think to have eternal life in them , and you not yet come to Christ that you May have life ? him whom the scriptures testifies of , and saith , he is the trus light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world , that all Might believe in the light , and become children of light , and he who followeth him should not walk in darkness , but he shall have the light of life , and know Christ Jesus , who is the way so the father , the truth , and the life , who saith , no man cometh unto the father but by me : i am come a light into the world , &c.  what do you not believe Christ ? Or do you think to find another way to the father ? an easier way than Christ ? or a broader way ? A way which is not a cross to your wills , or a way where you May walk yourselves without a guides , that ye May go whither you list , ( but that 's not the way to God ) as Christ told Peter , when he was young he gird himself , and went whither he would , &c.  answer me plainly to these queries , oh ye priests and professors , who have been so long talking of the scriptures , but have been out of the truth , and out of the life of righteousness , and out of the light , and out of the way , who have been wandering in the darkness , not knowing whether you go , and seeking the living amongst the dead , and are erred from the truth in your hearts , and hold it in the unrighteousness , professing the true words , but are , and have been out of the truth , and so could never be established there ; for none can ever be established , but in the truth and in the righteousness . 

But ye have been out of the life , and so are dead men still , and are yet in the graves , and have not heard his voice that should raise you up yet , because you have not harkened diligently that your souls Might live ; though you have been long talking of him , and searching for him without in the observations , and have been saying , Lot , here is Christ , and Lot he is there , in this form , or in that form of worship , and in this , or that Ordinande ; so death hith heard of the fame of wisdom , and hath been talking of the fame of wisdom , which is justisied of her children ; but ye who only have been talking of wisdom , and speaking of it , while you were in the death , and did not learn the way to life , ye are but soolish children , and are not justified ; for you have all been but as the foolish . Virgins ( The best of you ) who have had lamps , but wanted oil , and so ye are in the dark still , your lamps are not burning , nor your lights shining ; neither hath your light so shined before men , that they May see your good works , and glorify the father : but you have all professed that which ye did not possess , and so are found in the hypocrisy , and your righteousness hath been like the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , whom Christ told , should in is wise enter into the kingdom of heaven ; now all that are but there will be shut out ; though you have been talking of faith , and hope , and sanctification , and redemption , and adoption , and justification by Christ , and by his righteousness , while you are in the unrighteousness , and in the sin , and transgression , who would have Christ's righteousness to be a cloak and cover for your sins , and would be justified by Christ in your sins , who came to save his people from sin , and to destroy sin , and to destroy the devil who is the author of it ; and he came to take away all cloaks and covers for sin , who saith himself , if i had not come and spokon to you , ye had not had sin , but now have ye no cloak for your sin , so he it is that hath spoken to you once and again , but ye have not regarded , and he doth speak to you , and reproves you for sin , all of you secretly in your consciences , and for your evil deeds , by the light of his spirit , with which he hath enlightened you all ; who saith , except ye believe that i am he , ye shall die in your sins ; and then there will be no covering for you , for your shame and nakedness will be seen , though ye May call to the rocks and mountains to fall upon you , and cover you . But the woe is unto all , who are covered with a covering , and not of my spirit , saith the Lord ; and woe will be for ever to all such who want the covering of God's spirit at the last day . 

Therefore all persons , turn in your minds to the light of Christ Jesuswithin you , which doth reprove you for sin , and never consents to the doing of any unrighteous thing , and believe in the light , and be obedient to it ( for obedience to it is life . ) Then will ye come to put off that , and be uncovered of that , which ye have been covered with , which the woe is too , & brings the trouble , and sorrow , and anguish upon your souls ; and which will bring shame and confusion , and woe and torment for ever , except it be cast off , and separated from . And who come to the light of Christ , and believe in it , and love it ( which is the law of the spirit of life ) with it they come to be quickened , and made alive unto God , and made dead unto sin ; and so come to be covered with the covering which the woe is not too ; for the spirit is life because of righteousness , but the body is dead unto sin ; as the apostle said , how can we who are dead unto sin , live any longer therein ? Mark ! They who were quickened ( Which Paul writ to , who were once dead in sins and trespasses , & children of wrath as well as others ) these were made alive unto God ; but they were first dead unto sin , and so could not live any longer therein , except they would go about to build again that which before they had destroyed , and so make themselves transgres7s ; o'er , 2 gal. 18.  

Now this the saints said and witnessed who were made alive unto God , and quickened by his spirit dwelling in them , and made free from the law of sin and death ; but now this is contrary to all the apostate Christians ( the priests and professors ) in this age ; who say , that they must live in sin , and have the body of sin as long as they be here , and none can be perfect here , nor be made free from sin , but they sin in thought , word and deed daily ; and say they had need to pray for the forgiveness of the sins of their prayers , and the best of their holy duties is full of sin , and the most righteous doth sin , &c. and so teach persons . 

These i say never yet did know sin destroyed , nor never yet come out of the transgression , nor our of the fall Adam's state , nor we yet requickened , but are still dead in their sins and trespasses , and therefore they are not like to show persons the way out of sin , or how to be freed from sin , for they themselves are still in the death , the dead not raised yet , and therefore hath all their preaching and praying been in vain , both to themselves and others , and their faith vain also , and they are yet in their sins , even as the apostle said , if the dead arise not , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is vain also , and ye are still in your sins . now you ( I say , ) who long have been called Christians , and you who have professed yourselves to be ministers of Christ , and yet are walking according to the course of this world , not redeemed out of the world , nor separated from the world , but dead in sins and trespasses , unquickned yet , unmade alive unto God , in the death yet , where all the world lies who are in the wickedness ; your conditions are far unlike to the saints conditions , who spoke forth the scriptures , ye who are not yet come from among the dark world , who sit in the darkness , and in the shadow of death , and love darkness rather than light , because their deeds are evil : and will not these teachers and professors abide with them in the darkness ? And doth it not appear that they are resolved upon it , who say they must have sin , and cannot be freed from it here , but as long as they live here they must carny a body of sin about with them , and a body of death , and so they walk in the shadow of it , and sit in the shadow of death , and are not yet come to the light , nor will they come to the light , ( that they Might see a way out of it ) but love their evil deeds rather than the light , so there they are sat down in the darkness , and remain in the death until this day , and will not arise , and hearken to the voice of Christ Jesus , whom God hath given for a covenant , for a light unto the gentiles , to open the blind eyes , and to unstop the deaf ears , and to bring the prisoner's oat of prison , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house ; and out of the house of bondage , where they are all in Egypt still , in the land of darkness ; and it hath been and is still the work of the hireling priests to cry peace to the persons there ; and when any of the servants of the Lord have been sent by him to call persons our of the darkness , to come to the light of Christ , which he hath enlightened them withal , that by it they Might be led out of spiritual Sodom and Egypt , where our Lord Jesus Christ hath been , and is crucified afresh , and put to open shame ; i say the priests and teachers , they have stood up to oppose , and have been like Jannes and Jambres who withstood Moses , and would have hindered the persons from going our of Egypt , even to keep persons in the darkness , and by the flesh-pors of Egypt , where they May eat and drink with the drunken , and satisfy their lusts , and yet notwithstanding tell the persons that they are the children of God , and Christians , and that none can be free from sin , and the best have their sailings , and so daub with untempered mortar , and speak peace where the Lord speaks no peace , and so lead persons about like silly women , laden with sins and diverse lusts , ever learning , but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth ; for who knows the truth , the truth makes them free , and brings them from under the load , and from under that which burdens , and vexeth the righteous soul , as the righteous soul of Lot was vexed from day to day with the unclean conversation of the wicked sodomites ; now these would keep persons in Sodom and Egypt , under the heavy burdens and loads in the fleshly lusts , and filthiness by the fleshpots of Egypt , that even people's hearts and minds have been boiling up with wickedness and uncleanness , and their eyes full of adulrery who cannot cease from sin , and here they have been ever learning , but could not know truth while they are there ; and so by this means they have made persons to pay them for reaching of them , and to uphold them , and give them fire , and these are the blind leaders of the blind into the ditch . 

But who comes to the light which Christ Jesus hath enlighmed them withal , to wait in it , and hearken diligently to it , they hear the voice of Christ and live , and arise up from their seats , and so come out of Egypt , and out of the shadow of death , and the house of bondage , and from under Pharaoh and his taskmasters , and they come through the sea , ( as Israel did , and was baptised unto Moses in the cloud , and in the sea , ) and through the fire to be baptised into the name of Christ , with the spirit and with fire and to be baptised all into one spirit , and to be made like unto Christ in his death , to be made dead unto sin that they May not live any longer therein , and to drink of the spiritual drink , and to eat of the spiritual meat , and to drink of the spiritual rock , which rock is Christ that is gone before us , ( which rock is the same which Israel drank of which followed them ) who were under the law until the seed came , which seed is Christ , who redeems from under the law , who was made under the law , that he Might redeem them which were under the law , who fulfilled the law , and blotted out the hand writing of ordinances , and nailed them to his cross , which whosoever are followers of him , they must take up this cross which crucifies the flesh with the affections , and lusts , and makes dead unto sin , and slays the transgressor , and so makes peace through the blood of his cross ; i say this cross must be taken up daily by all who will be true disciple indeed , and true Christians ; the preaching of which cross now to the world and professors therein is foolishness , and is despised , and cannot be endured , as it was formerly to the Jews a stumbling block , and to the Greeks foolishness ; but unto them that believed therein both Jews and Greeks , it was the power of God , and the wisdom of God , and to them that believe now it is the same , but unto the unbelieving it is foolishness even to all who are not yet turred to the light of Christ Jesus within , which he hath enlightened them withal , they are still in the unbelief , and so never yet knew the power of God , nor the wisdom of God , and so it is foolishness to them , for they are all spiritually blind , and so cannot discern the things of God which are spiritually discerned , but are all as foolish and sottish children without understanding , and untaught , and unlearned , neither are they come to receive the law from him who is the lawgiver , that they Might be taught of him , who sarth , learn of me , i am meek , and lowly in heart , and ye shall find rest for your souls , and be made wise unto salvation , for in him is hide the treasure of wisdom and knowledge . now all those who only looks out at , the scriptures , and comes not to the light of Christ within , which the scriptures declares of , the treasure of wisdom and knowledge is still hide from them ; for it is in Christ Jesus from whence the light comes ; which light leadeth to Christ , where the treasure is hide , and where the life is hide from all the world yet , who are searching the scriptures , and thinking in them to have eternal life ; but ye will not come unto me that ye May have life , saith Christ ; i am the life , the way , and the truth , and our life is hide with Christ in God , said the saints . 

Therefore now all persons , this is an invitation of love to all your souls , to turn in your minds to the light of Christ within you , which is spiritual , holy , true , just and good , which will let you all see what your words are , your actings are ( though done in secret ) and what the thoughts and intents of your hearts are , it will try them all , and let you all see ( your minds being truly turned to it ) what is in your hearts and minds , and what your ways are now , and have been , and what your lives are , and how you have lived . Now this i say , which lets you see these things , and reproves what is contrary to it , will let ye see whether ye are come to Christ yea or nay ; who is the way unto God , the truth , and the life ; and the righteousness of God , from whence the light cometh ; and so here every one of you will know judgement laid to the line , and righteousness to the plummet , and that which is lies and deceit , and hypocrisy , will be judged , and condemned in every particular , with the light , which is and will be the condemnation of the world , who love their evil deeds , evil ways , evil lives , evil thoughts and intents of their hearts , and evil words , rather than the light which doth reprove them : and therefore the way , the truth , and the life , which is Christ , is hide from them ; and they know not him in whom the treasure of wisdom and knowledge is hide . now the light is that which doth reveal , and make manifest that which is hide , and hath been hide from the wise and prudent men of this world , and hath been hide from ages and generations past . But now is the truth plainly seen , and known , and declared , as it was in former ages ( by them whom it was then manifested to , by the spirit of God ) even by us ( whom the world in soorns call Quakers ) who have believed in the light of Christ , and received the manifestation of his spirit ( which is light ) which is freely given , and tendered unto all , and hath appeared unto all ; but is not , neither hach been received by all . but as many as receiveth him , to them doth he give power to become the sons of God , even to as many as believe i• his name , who is the true light , and who is true , and faithful , and everlasting ; the same to day , yesterday , and the same for evermore . 

And this we can declare forth freely unto the nations round about , which we have freely received of him , even of his spirit of truth , which was the promise of the father , to lead us into all truth , whereby we are come to know the leadings of the spirit ; and know that we are the children of God , and taught of God ; and led by his spirit , and this is it which doth comfort our hearts , and assure us that we are his children : and as many as are the sons of God , the same are led by the spirit of God ; as the children of this world are led by the spirin that is of the world , which is of him who is called the god of the world ; whose work it is to blind the minds of persons ( as we were also at well as others ) while we were in the vain conversation , and walked according to the course of this world , even the Prince of the power of the air ; that spirit which now worketh in all . the children of disobedience . and they May be easily known , for they are full of air , and talk of that which they possess not , of others conditions and not their own , and so have been in travel ( as it were ) but have brought forth nothing but wind ; have a form of godliness , but want the power , and are talking of the spirit of God , but are led by the spirit of this world , and are disobedient to the manifestation of the spirit of God , which reproveth them for sin , and checks them secretly when they do evil . But all who receives it , and are obedient to it , they know the movings of the spirit , and the teachings and leadings of the spitit ; and what it is to be born of the Spirir , and what it is to live in the spirit , and to walk in the spirit , and to mortify the deeds of the body by the spirit , and so to be quickened by the spirit ; and what it is to be raised up from the dead ( with Christ ) by his spirit dwelling in them ; now if any man have not the spirit of Christ , the same is none of his . therefore how can any of the priests , and teachers , and professors in the world confess Christ come in the flesh , and know not the spirit which is of God , &c.  who say they have not the same spirit that was in Christ & the apostles , and saints , and say none have the same spirit now which they had ? Therefore i say truly they are not like to know that spirit , who are erred from it , nor confess Christ come in the flesh , who are of another spirit , which not being the same , must needs be the spirit of this world ( which is the spirit of Antichrist ) by which they cannot know the things of God ; for none knows the things of God , saving the spirit of God ; neither were they like to discern them , or demonstrate them by the spirit which they have not , but are erred from it ; nor know the scriptures which were given forth by the spirit of God in the prophets , Christ , and the apostles , but give their private interpretation of them , and meaning which they add to them , which is of no private interpretation ; for the spirit of the Lord was but one in all them that spoke them forth ; and them who are in the same spirit and life now reads them , and knows them again as they were spoken , and knows the interpretation of them , which is not private , but public , and plain , and manifest ; but all who are of another spirit , they are erred not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God ( As Christ said ) and so they neither know that which hath been spoken by the spirit of God formerly , not what the same spirit speaketh expressly now , not what the scripture means where it is spoken plainly and expressly . and truly it is no wonder now to see it so ; for persons and their teachers are so far erred from the spirit by which the scriptures were spoken forth , that it is become a strange thing ( which cannot be believed ) even amongst all forts of professors who are called Christians ; for one to say he is moved by the spirit of the Lord to speak , or to pray , or to do any thing else ( as the servants of the Lord were in former times ) and this is become a scorn and derision amongst them , which is a shame to them , and doth plainly manifest what spirit they are of . 

Now if they were children of God , or sons of God ( who are led by the spirit of God , as some of th' one profess themselves to be ) mark this diligently , then must they needs know the meaning of the spirit of God , and the leadings of it , otherwise it could not lead them and they not know it ; and they would be in the spiritual feeling , and tasting , and savouring , and discerning of the things of God in themselves , and of the fruits of the spirit in others brought forth , and try all spirits with that , and know them , and love the good , and not mock and scoff at them . And so i say , than it would not be a strange thing unto them , if they themselves were come to know a motion , or leading by the spirit of God in themselves , which would manifest that they were the children of God , and sons of God ; that they were of Christ , who have his spirit , and are led by it , and so were true Christians , and followers of Christ ; and this would be a true restimony to themselves , and to others ; and then surely they , neither any of you would mock , or scoff , or scorn at any who can witness the same . 

But now the want of this hath caused your nakedness appear to your shame , and to the shame of all your blind guides whom ye have so long been following for teaching , who have caused you to err by their lies , otherwise they Might have brought you to have known the truth before now , and to have reached you better manners , then to have scoffed at it , and at those who have declared it amongst you , and walk in it ( whom you in scorn call Quakers ) and utter forth evil words , which corrupts the good manners ; howsoever if it were so , that we were not in the truth , but in the error , and not moved by the spirit of the Lord , as ye say , but erred from it ; then we were but where ye are . 

Now friends this i say , and testify in the Lord , and know assuredly that my testimony is true , and God's witness in all your consciences shall bear witness to it to be true , and the scriptures of truth will bear witness to the same ; that ye cannot say in truth ( whom any of you do scoff , or scorn , or mock , or reproach any of us , or others ) that ye are moved thereunto by the spirit of God , or led unto it by the spirit of God , or taught by the spirit of God to do so , or taught by the scriptures to do so , which the holy men of God spoke forth , which ye call your rule . Neither can ye say , that scoffing , and scorning , and repsoaching , and persecuting is the fruits of the spirit of God . But on the contrary , it is the fruits of that spirit in you which lusteth to envy , which is of the envious one , the enemy of all mankind , the devil , who was a liar , & a murderer from the beginning , & out of the truth . 

And so it is he that moves some to murder now , and some to accuse falsely , ( for he is the accuser of the brethron ) and he moves some to persecute , and to hate , and to cast into prisons now , ( those that live in the truth , and bear witnessetoit ) and he moves others to scoff , and scorn , and speak all manner of evil of them that are good now in these days , as he did of old ; he it was that led Cain to murder his brother Abel who was a righteous man , and it was he who moved Ishmaell to mock at Isaac , who was the son of promise ; and it was he ( the devil ) that moved the scribes and Pharisees to say that Christ had a devil , and that he cast out devils through Belzebub , &c. and led them to persecute Christ , and put him to death , and Judas to betray him , and the high priests and the rest to spit upon him , and smite him , and crown him with thorns , and mock at him , and to say hail King of the Jews , and to cry to have him crucified , and Barrabas to be released , ( who was a robber ) now here are some of the fruits of that spirit which is not of God , nor of Christ Jesus , but is against God , and against Christ Jesus : and the scripture saith be not ye mockers , lest your bonds be made strong ; and the scriptures speaks of some who mocked the messengers of God , and despised those whom he sent to warn them till his wrath broke out upon them to destroy them ; now they that did so were not moved & led by the spirit of God , but by the evil spirit which is of the devil . 

Therefore now all persons try and examine yourselves , and see what spirit ye are of , and what spirit ye are led by , by the fruits which ye bring forth : for this i say , and know and testify , that there is no persons upon the face of the earth , but they are either of the good spirit , or of the evil spirit ; that is , they are either led by the spirit of God , or by the spirit of the devil ; and this is that , which doth nearly concern all persons to know which of these they are led by , which they May know by the fruits which they bring forth , for that is it which doth , and will make it manifest plainly , even as a tree doth manifest itself what it is , whether good or evil , by the fruit it brings forth , for the fruit doth come from the sap and virtue , ( or as i May say , the spirit and life that is in the tree ) which comes from the root of it , and ground in which it stands ; now the scripture saith , a good tree bringeth forth good fruit , and again , if the root be holy , so are the branches , than the fruit is good , there is the good tree ; but now if the root be rotten or corrupt , which stands in the cursed ground , than the branches will be rotten and corrupt , & the fruit will be evil , or none at all , and there is the corrupt tree , which is to be hewn down and cast into the fire , and burned , for it is good for nothing else ; and there is the plant which must be plucked up , which Christ saith , the father hath not planted , for its a degenerate plant . 

Now persons these parables are true , therefore learn to read them , and understand them with the light that Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withal , who spoke them forth unto the world , who is the gift of the father's love unto the world , whom he hath sent a light into the world , that all men through the light May believe , which they that did believe in him who is the light , he said unto them , it was given to know the mystery of the kingdoms of God , but unto the world who did not then believe in him , they were parables , and are so still to this day . 

Now the light which Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withal is the gift of God to you , and the manifestation of his spirit which is given to you , and his grace which hath appeared unto you all , ( which brings salvation ) therefore receive it , and believe in it , and be obedient to it , and so you will come to know the mysteries of the kingdom , and to understand all the parables which Christ spoke to the world , & know the key of David which opens and none shuts , and shuts and noman opens ; otherwise ye will all remame in the dark world still , which loves not the light , but doth choose darkness rather ; and they will remain parables to you still , and ye will be shut up in the unbelief , and in the darkness , & the light will be your condemnation for ever . 

Therefore in true love i exhort you all to consider , in time oh all ye persons , professors and profane , that ye May escape that eternal condemnation and judgement which will come upon all the world of unbelievers , and ungodly men , who do not believe in the light of Christ Jesus , who is come a light into the world , but slight it , and hate it , ( and say it is not sufficient to lead to Christ , and to lead to salvation ) which reproves you for sin , and for your evil deeds , that ye Might be turned from sin and from the power of Satan to God ; otherwise your sins , and your evil deeds , which now ye love rather than the light which reproves them , will be sufficient to sink ye down into hell , and into the pit of perdition . 

I say now is the day of the Lord's visitation of his grace and mercy and love to your souls , that he would not have any of you to perish , but all to come to the knowledge of his truth , which would surely save you , and set you free . Every one therefore seriously to sit down and consider where ye have been , and what ye have been doing , and what ye are doing , and what ye have gotten , and what ye do possess of all that which ye have made profession of , and what assurance ye have of the health , and welfare , and salvarion of your souls ; and what certain evidence and testimony ye have thereof in yourselves , and to yourselves ; for that alone will stand you in stead , and be your comfort and stay in time of trouble , and in the hour of temptation , and when ye come to lie upon your deathbeds , when all things else will fail you , and yield ye no comfort nor help ; nay your teachers whom ye have so long been following , cannot help you , nor comfort you , if ye have not the witness in yourselves , and testimony of God's spirit to bear witness with your spirits that ye are the children of God ; all your profession will be nothing worth , which hath only stood in words and outside worships , and forms , without the power and life of that which ye have professed . 

Therefore honestly consider in time , and turn in your minds to the light of Christ Jesus in all your consciences , which is God's witness in you all , which will either accuse or excuse you , and acquit , or condemn you in every thing that ye do , or word ye speak , or thought that ye think . If ye do turn your minds into it , and wait in it , by it you will come to see , and examine , and truly to search and try what is in your hearts and minds at all times , and so come to be acquainted therewith , and see what lodgeth there . Otherwise ye will not know , nor be acquainted with your own hearts , which will then deceive you , for they are desperately wicked , and ye will not know that wickedness that is there , which is ready to join to any thing that is evil , and to be led into any error ; but as ye do mind that of God within you , which will searh your hearts , and try your reins . And in this condition have persons been , and are still in the world , and in all their professions there and worships , which stands in ourward observations , and carnal ordinances , and worships set up in men's wills , and practised in the world's spirit , which knows not God , nor the things of God , and are in their own wills , and led by that spirit . So their hearts & minds are drawn out into those things , to look at the things that are seen which are temporal , which are of the world , from that which May be known of God , which is manifest in them , from the things which are not seen , which are eternal , and with which they should know the true , and living God , whom they have for a long time been thus ignorantly worshipping , not knowing of him , though he was not far from every one of them , neither have they known the true worship of him , which is in the spirit , & in the truth , in which the true church stands and is gathered our of the world , and out of itsworships & ways and customs , which are corrupt , and are upholden by men's laws , made in their corrupt wills , whereby they have compelled persons to their worships which is not true , but are all erred from the truth , and true worship , and true church which is in God the father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the pillar and ground of truth , wherein they worship God in the spirit , and in the truth , and so have found the father , who is seeking such to worship him in this his day , which now is dawned after the long night of apostasy & darkness which hath been over all persons , so that the whole earth hath been covered with darkness , and the veil hath been over all faces , and the whole earth been corrupted by the abominable worships that hath been therein in this time of darkness in the false church , which is the whore of Babylon , the mother of harlots , and the abomination of the earth ( gotten up in the room of the true church ) with her false worships in imitation of the true worship , whereby all nations have been drunken with the cup of her fornications ; and all the Emperors , Kings , Princes and judges , and rulers of the earth , and they have all been making of laws to uphold her , and she hath ridden upon them , for they have been the beast which have carried her ; and the beast and the false prophet ( which receives their power from the dragon ) have made war with the saints , and overcome them ; and their blood hath been shed by her , which hath cried , and doth cry unto the Lord for vengeance , and the Lord hath heard the cry of it . And he is now risen to take vengeance upon all them that dwell upon the earth , where the devil hath been their King , who is the dragon that old serpent , who was cast out into the earth ; and now the time is come that he shall be bound and chained and cast into the pit , and the beast & the false prophet ) with him , shall be taken alive and cast into the lake . And the Lord God is come to judge the great whore ( The false church ) who hath set upon the Kings of the earth , & made them drunk with her cup , and to render vengeance with fury upon her , and burn her with fire . And all her merchants shall cry woe and alack , who have been made rich with her merchandise : and the great city shall fall in which they have been trading ; which is Babylon the mother of them all ; in what form , or profession , of show , or colour , or dress soever they have appeared ; for the hour of her judgement is come , and strong is the Lord that judgeth her . Therefore woe , wo , from the Lord will be unto all that seek to uphold her , and come 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 of her ! For all that drink of her cup , and partake with her in her s••• , must be sure to partake of her plagues . And the decree of the Lord is sealed , and gone forth against her , and the war is openly proclaimed against her , and the beast , and the false prophets who have gove forth to deceive . and the lamb is come forth , and his sword is drawn , and ho is riding on conguering and to conquer , and with him are his saints , who are called , and faithful , and chosen , who are made willing to follow him whither soever he goes . and the victory is determined , the lamb and the saints shall have the victory ; and their weapons are not carnal , but spiritual : for with the sword of the spirit which proceeds out of the mouth of the lamb shall all his enemies be slain ; and great shall be the day of slaughter of God's enemies , who have the beasts mark , or his name , or are of the number of his name ; they shall all be slain both small and great ; even all whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life , who was stain from the foundation of the world . and this the Lord is now bringing to pass in this his day , not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit will i do this , saith the Lord . And therefore blessed are all they who have an care to hear , and an eye open to see what the Lord is doing , and a heart to understand , and receive his counsel , and to do his commandments , and his will , and to answer his requirings .
