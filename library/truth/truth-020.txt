Friends , 

The innocency and truth of my cause , doth lift up its head unto all persons , and stands justified in the sight of God and all just men , and in justice and righteousness it cannot be condemned , or judged guilty by any man ; and it is upon me yet once more to state it before you , that you and all men May see the countenance and favour thereof , ( For it dare show its face unto you , and all persons ) though much already hath been written and spoken about it , which you have not taken notice of ( As you ought to have done ) but yet many are informed in the truth of the matter , & what hath been spoken is not in vain , though my just cause lies always at the stake , and is hardly thought upon by you , and vilified and evil spoken of before you by my adversary , who always seeks false judgement against me , to justify himself in his iniquity , and to condemn the guiltless ; for the Lord knows , and just men knows , and the witness of God in your consciences May show you that i have not wronged Richard Mayo , nor spoken of him any thing saving the truth , and because thereof , and without any other cause , am i thus prosecuted by him in his pleading before you , and begging of you for false judgement , which if he should obtain it , and you should give it , yet should i be clean in the sight of the Lord , though by you i May deeply suffer ; and your own unrighteous judgement if it proceed from you ) will return one day upon your own heads , and the weight of your own iniquity shall the Lord lay upon your own consciences , in the day when he judges the secrets of all hearts ; and to God i have appealed in this thing , who justifies me because of truth , and than who shall justly condemn me , while truth is on my side , and i not convinced to the contrary . 

Therefore in the fear of the Lord God , i say unto you , take heed what you do in this matter ; but deal impartially in the sight of the Lord , in the examination thereof , and try , whether i have spoken the truth , or whether i have spoken falsely ; and hearken to my plea , which i have often asserted before you , and do yet once more lay before your view , and i do appeal to the light of your consciences , and let that justify me , or condemn me ; and this i testify as my sufficient plea : unto you , ( Which no man hath truly answered before you , ) that i have spoke nothing but the truth of Richard Mayo my adversary ; to this i stand to be justified , and if i be condemned , it is for this , this resteth with me for ever , and if i fall , i fall for it , ( Viz ) for speaking the truth , and if i stand , i stand by it , and no man whatsoever can convince me to the contrary ; and hereof am i invincible , and if you condemn me for this ( To wit ) for speaking the truth , it will be upon you , and i am clear , and this is my only plea , which i have often , and May by the spirit of the Lord always clearly demonstrate , and i do indeed wave all the multitude of arguments that hath been , or can be made , by the lawyers in this business , and not by words of man's wisdom , but by truth must i be justified ; and i do here again return to my first manner of proceeding , and stand to the naked simplicity of truth , and i have no other defence to shelter under , neither do i choose any , nor no other weapon to resist my enemy with , but the word of the Lord which is truth ; and if truth will not justify me , i will not be justified , and if it will condemn me , my mouth shall be stopped ; for by the truth i stand , and if i fall , i fall for it , in this matter ; and therefore you my judges patiently hear a few words again , as to the beginning of the matter betwixt Richard Mayo , and me , which is thus , he sent for me by a messenger to come to him , and being come to him , he challenged me to speak what i had against him , & again under his own hand he challenged me to dispute , either in public or private with him ; and he again bade me call him deceiver if i durst , and upon all these four particular invitations and challenges , and also knowing him to be guilty , as i am still able to prove ; i did say to him that he held forth damnable doctrine , and error , and that he was a deceiver , and this was the beginning of the controversy ; whereby i would have you to take notice , how unrighteously he hath dealt with me , first to invite me , and challenge me several times ; and then for speaking the truth of him ( Which i am able prove ) to arrest me , imprison me , and thus to prosecute me , is not this unchristian like , & not like a minister of Christ ? and this i proved in your court , his challenging of me , and also i have manifested divers particular sayings of his , which doth appear to all sober men to be damnable doctrine , and error ; and for the manifesting of my innocent cause further , and that you May know , that you ought not to condemn me , ( Neither can you with a safe and good conscience in the sight of God ) and to lay the truth as plainly as i can before you ; therefore i do here insert the particulars to you again , which i proved in the open court against Richard Mayo , which i do say is damnable doctrine , and error , all , or some of them at least . 

1.  That Paul , as a minister of Christ exhorted saints ( The Corinthians ) to follow and obey a light which was not Christ , nor the light of the gospel . 
2.  He did exhort the persons of Kingston , as a minister of Christ in his preaching to them , to follow and obey a light , which ( Said he ) is not Christ , nor the light of the gospel . 
3.  He said that a man May be a righteous man , and not a godly man without distinction . 
4.  Also at another time before that , rich. Mayo affirmed that the light of Christ which every man is lightened withal , John 1 9 is carnal , and darkness . 
5.  He did affirm under his own hand , that Christ was not the word that David walked by . 
6.  He affirmed that the devil is the power of God . 
7.  He affirmed that the gospel is not the power of God , no more than a rose cake is , which he laid his hand on in the window , at the present of his so saying . 
8.  He affirmed , if one man murder another , he did it by the power of God . 
Now hereby it May appear to you , ( If you do not wilfully harden yourselves against the truth , and the righteousness of my cause ) that i have done Richard Mayo no wrong , only i have spoken the truth of him ; i said he held forth damnable doctrine , and error which saying , is truth , and i had a good cause to speak it , for he invited , and challenged me divers times to speak it , and then when this is considered by you , let your consciences judge what wrong i have done him ; seeing it doth appear i have spoken the truth of him , and had good reason so to do ; ye my judges , at whose door my cause ( Which is innocent ) lies despised , and ready to be condemned , come but to plainness and honesty in your own hearts , and be not passionate towards me , but use meekness , and let the sincerity of your hearts tell me , whether i have lied or spoken truth ; but if you do the worst that can be done against me , i must , and have already committed my cause to God , and i doubt not but he will avenge my cause , and recompense my adversaries in his season . Now again consider , if Richard Mayo did make his invitations to me , on purpose to ensnare me , ( As it May be justly supposed that he did ) that he Might have occasion to execute his malice upon me , than you ought not to give judgement against me , and to be his executiners ; for if he hath laid his plot to ensnare me , how can you justly give him power over me ? and he hath no power over me except you give it him by unjust judgement ; and you can but give him power over my body , for my spirit is at liberty , and in dominion over you and him , because i have the truth on my side , and it is hard for you to strive against that , for it cannot be buried , but the truth of my cause will always live to vex its opposers ; but and if his challenges to me was not to ensnare me , but for information ( Supposing himself to have been clear from all damnable doctrine and error ) than he had done well to have owned my words as a reproof , and to have repent , and not , to have held forth any more such doctrine ; and you ought not for reproving him , to condemn me , for reproving any man for evil ought not to be condemned ; good men will not do it , neither would he ( Were he ) not an ungodly man prosecute me thus violently , & thus continually beg your judgement of 100 l. against me , for reproving of him , & declaring against his false doctrine , which he delivers to the persons , when as himself first invited me to speak to him ; and the Lord knows the souls of persons are so dear to me , that where i hear false doctrine held forth , which would destroy the innocent souls , i cannot but reprove it , least persons receive false doctrine for true , to the destruction of their own souls , and upon that account i spoke in this cause ; wherefore take you into consideration what Richard Mayo's end was in inviting me , & do not you fulfil his evil purpose , which i believe , if he had power over me , would execute his farthest cruelty upon me ; i have good reason to believe it , for many cruel threatuing words have proceeded from him already agianst i , but the Lord can deliver me from them all , but if he will not , he will give me patience to bear it , whatsoever is suffered to come to me ; but , and if any shall doubt , and cannot receive these things , and believe that these particulars are damnable doctrine and error , as they are laid down in themselves , and if what is spoken already be not sufficient , i May upon any just opportunity prove unto you , and all men , in the sight of my enemies that these particulars held forth by Richard Mayo , and alleged by me before you , are damnable doctrine and error , and if i could be convinced to the contrary by him , or any man , in sober arguments , according to the scriptures ; and if he shall be able to prove that these things are true , and sound , and saving doctrines , then May i confess that i have wronged him , which never can be done ; therefore can i never confess ( Without lying against my conscience , ) that i have wronged him ; but God justifies me , and just men , and my own conscience excuses me from all wrong in this matter ; and here , or hereafter shall you and he know it also , that i am without offence to him in this cause ; and if i suffer , i suffer , be it upon you that are my judges , and the guilt of my sufferings will be upon you one day ; for , for the truth's sake am i not afraid nor ashamed to suffer whatsoever you lay upon me . And whereas it is chiefly pleaded by my adversary and his council , that he is damnified , and much dangered by the speaking of my words , and because i said he held forth damnable doctrine , therefore say they , he is in danger to loose his place , and so he and his wife , and family cannot tell how to live &c.  These things they plead , and upon this account begs judgement against me , because he is , or May be in danger to be damnified . to this i reply , and friends i would have you to consider , he hath not yet proved to you the damage of the value of two pence , nor is he in any outward estate worse , by loss of any thing outwardly , by any thing that i have spoken ; and it is unjust to condemn me in an 100 l. upon supposed danger , and damage , which May come , while as he hath sustained none at present ; and further i say unto you , i have had no intentions of evil against him , nor purpose in my heart to endanger or damnify him in any outward thing , God is my witness ; but that nakedly , and simply i spoke the truth of him . and if speaking the truth to him doth endanger him , and damnify him , according as they plead , than is he a bad man , and an evil person , and not well worthy of you taking part with him , if you be just men , ( As yet i know nothing to the contrary ) nor worthy of giving your judgement against me for him ; if the speaking truth to him can so endanger him , then consider you what a man he is ; for speaking of the truth can never hurt an honest man , nor damnify a good man , for honest men rejoiceth in the truth , and the speaking of it is an honour to them ; but speaking the truth May indeed endanger and damnify a bad person , as to discover his wickedness , and to prevent him of more wickedness , which he May intend , but speaking the truth cannot damnify a a good man ; and if it be so that Richard Mayo ( Because of his badness ) be damnified by my speaking the truth to him ; must i therefore be condemned for speaking truth , or ought you to do it ? Let that of God in you answer ; will you justify his false doctrines , and condemn me for reproving him ? Did ever any good men , or just judges of old condemn any man for speaking the truth ? or will you shame yourselves , in the sight of wise men , by acting contrary to a good conscience ? which if ye do condemn me for speaking the truth , i do , and must tell you ( While i live ) that your judgement is unjust , and you act contrary to a good conscience , and are unrighteous judges , and that you commit the great abomination , in justifying the wicked and condemning the righteous ; and is it not a shame to him that professeth to be a minister of Christ , to plead the loss of his livelihood and of his calling , and the poverty of his wife and family , &c. because of my speaking the truth to him ? Never any of Christ's ministers pleaded any such thing ; were not they reproached and much spoken against ? And they were called deceivers , and seditious men , and such like ; and did they proceed on this manner , as he hath done against me ? Nay , they forgave their enemies . And if i had spoken falsely of him : ( As i have not ) he ought not to have done thus , if he had been a minister of Christ , as he professeth ; and doth his livelihood , and his place , and his maintenance of himself and his family depend upon my forbearing to speak the truth ? For he pleads that he is damnified , and endangered in all these , by what i have spoken ; and i still testify and all good men , knows , that i have given no offence , saving then speaking the truth ; and rather than he shall be damnified by my speaking the truth of him , will you unjustly damnify me for speaking the truth ? Is this the way of justice to condemn the truth that i have spoken , to save the guilty from supposed danger ? Consider of this , and save yourselves from unjust judgement , least the Lord justly judge you , and condemn you ; this i show in short , and much more i Might , as to the unjustness of the action prosecuted against me ; and now i come to show something of the unjust proceedings in this matter against me in the time of my trial , and other times , and some part thereof i here lay before you , that you , and all May see i have had as unjust proceedings against me in the matter , as an unjust action at first brought upon me . 

At my first appearance in my first answer , i demurred to the jurisdiction of your court , and shows that your court and judicatory being temporal , you could not ( In that Courtt ) ache cognizance of this cause , being of a spiritual dependency , and ought only to be tried in spiritual jurisdiction by spiritual judges ( If there were any such ) and showed out of the laws of England reasonably that your court had no power to try this matter ; but one of the bailiffs , John forth said ( Which should have been my equal judge ) they would overrule that , and they would try the matter , without showing any just reason out of the laws , against my argument grounded upon the laws , and they did overrule me in that ; and the court-day before the trial , when the jurymen was to be chosen and nominated , i told them that the jurymen should be such as had the give of the holy spirit , and the holy ghost in them , or else they could not try the matter , because it was doctrine that was to be tried ▪ which none could try , but by the spirit of God ; neither could i cast myself into the determination of any in this cause but such ; and the bailiffs Obadia Wicks , and John forth answered , if they were men that could take the evidence that i spoke my words against Richard Mayo , they were sufficient to try the matter ; whereby it doth appear that they had unjustly determined in themselves , not to try the doctrines , but to have a verdict against me howsoever ; again some that were called to be of the jury were heard to say , before they saw me , or ever heard the matter ; if i came into their hands they knew well enough what to do with me ; hereby it doth appear they were not equal men , but malicious and prejudiced against me ; and moreover in the very time of the trial , some of the jury , at the bar , said , they would not believe any thing , or take any witness for testimony , which any of those on my part , that were called Quakers , spoke ; and this was also the witness of their malicious , and envious spirits against me , who were rather as a party against me , than my equals ; and were not these unjust men for the trial of such a matter ? and moreover when all his witnesses could not say enough to give colour for a verdict against me , one of the bailiffs , John forth by name , who was one of the judges upon the bench , proffered to come down off the bench , and swear as a witness against me ; and when some spoke against that , he sent for a man into the court out of the town , James Levite by name , and whispered with him upon the bench , & told him what he should swear , and he went to the bar and took his oath against me , that i followed Richard Mayo with reviling language , in three several rooms , in bailiff Gunstones' house , which i do testify , was a false oath , before the Lord , and all men ; and many knows that i speak the truth , & that that man took a false oath , who was sent for into the court , & told by one of the judges what he should swear ; i suppose bailiff Gunston himself knows that this was a false witness , & are not these unjust proceedings ? I appeal to your consciences , and upon such proceedings as these , was a verdict gained against me , by much a do , in above three hour's time ; and the foreman of the jury himself said , he would not have brought a verdict against me , but only for the man's oath , James Levite , which as i have said , swore falsely , being sent for , and told by another man what he should say ; again , when the foreman of the jury said , they could not try the cause , and desired it Might be referred , the said bailiff forth on the bench cried no , and told Richard Mayo he should not refer it , he should have a verdict first , and ought my judge thus to have spoken ? no , he appeared to be rather a party against me , than my equal judge ; and to all sober men , these proceedings May appear to be unjust ; and i hope some of you will make more conscience of your doings , then to pass judgement upon such an unrighteous verdict and moreover , the jury did not try the cause , which only ought to have been tried , which was , whether i had spoken truly , or falsely of Richard Mayo , that is to say , they ought to have tried , ( And that was the thing in controversy between us ) whether these particulars alleged by me against Richard Mayo were true , and sound doctrine or damnable doctrine and errors , for if the particulars mentioned be true , and sound doctrine , which were affirmed by Richard Mayo , than i have wronged him , and i must confess it , and assent to your judgement ; but if the particulars be false doctrine , and error , than i have done him no wrong , for i have spoken nothing but the truth ; and for that , how can you condemn me ? And this was the cause to be tried , which the jury themselves confessed they did not try , and therefore the matter is not yet tried in truth , neither have i had a legal trial before you , and then how can you give judgement against me , being the action itself , is so unequal , and the proceedings so unjust also , and the matter yet not fully tried ? do but consider of these things in the coolness of your spirits , and let not me receive worse dealing from you , because i am a stranger , neither because i am a Quaker so called ; but deal justly , and truly , for i desire nothing else of you , but true judgement , for that will justify me , and clear me , and respect not persons , but have respect to the law of God , which commandeth you to hear , and judge the cause of the poor , and of the stranger , without respect of persons , and if you give regard to the law of God in this matter , you cannot give judgement upon this verdict , which is thus unjustly brought in , by unrighteous and partial men , as is manifest , and you must either wholly arrest judgement , or at least you must bring it to a new trial , else you do me much wrong and injustice , and all good men will so judge of it ; and further , divers sufficient reasons hath been showed by men of knowledge in the law , first against this action , and also against the proceedings herein , which Might be reasons to you not to go on in judgement against me , but to clear me ; and even in your own way , ( As i May say ) you have been dealt with , and you have been showed my innocency ; so that if your hearts be not hardened , you cannot go any further against me , but go contrary to the truth of my cause , and contrary to your own law also ; and though it was the dear love , and respect of friends to the truth , in freeness of their love to me , more than any desire of mine , or my knowledge ; i do own their love , and justify it , yet much that hath been spoken in forms and tricks of law , and punctillios of law i do wave , and lets it pass , and keeps always to the naked truth of the matter , as before laid down ; and therefore if any jury shall upon their oaths justify , Richard Mayo his doctrines to be true and sound doctrine ; and if you yourselves , upon your oaths dare give judgement , that Richard Mayo his doctrine , is not damnable doctrine , and errors ; then i must lie patiently under your judgement , and under the breach of such jury-mens' oaths , and of your own oaths also ; and therefore i demand of you according to right and justice let me be cleared , otherwise let me first have a fair trial before i be condemned , which yet i have not had , because the matter was perverted from that , whether i had spoken the truth , upon which the true issue dependeth , and upon no other thing . whether i spoke maliciously , was a straining of the cause to a wrong head , and perverting it from its proper issue , and hereby was the just cause of the innocent clouded over , and rejected , and vilified , and even betrayed into another meaning , more than it ought to have been ; but it can show its face above all this , and truth cannot be daunted though it May be veiled and lie hide for a season , and though i be condemned by the prejudice and unsaithful jury speaking maliciously , yet the Lord bears me witness to the contrary , and that i have no malice in me against any man , and i love your souls better , then that you should endanger them to destruction , and to everlasting burning , by giving judgement upon your oaths against me upon this verdict , in this cause which is thus unjust and unequal in itself , and in its proceedings also ; for if the jury had tried , whether i had spoke the truth , or whether i belied Richard Mayo than it would easily have been known whether i spoke malioiously ; for if i belied him , and if his doctrine be true , and sound , and not error , then May it be easily judged that i spoke maliciously , because i spoke not the truth , but if his doctrines alleged by me , be not true , and sound doctrine , but damnable doctrine and error , than i have not belied him but spoken the truth in love , and not maliciously , for truth and malice goes not together ; and till this be tried , to wit , whether i have spoken truly or falsely , who shall be able upon their oaths ( Without forswearing themselves ) to give it upon their oaths that i spoke maliciously ? nay , how shall any men lawfully swear , that one speaks maliciously ? it is a hard cause to swear that any man speaks in malice , for who enters into the heart of another man , to know the thoughts , save God , and his spirit . 

And this i May say at least , and safely too , that , that jury , which gave into the court upon their oaths , that i spoke my words maliciously against Richard Mayo , have greatly endangered the forswearing themselves , and the breach of their own oaths , and some of them knows before this day that they did transgress therein against God , whom God suddenly after cut off with judgement , and took off the earth by death ; and though they , that are yet living May be insensible of their own wickedness , yet let all good men fear to die out of this body with that burden upon their consciences , as some have , and others of them May have , in this particular , for breach of oaths ; and though they have given it to you upon their oaths , that i spoke maliciously , yet woe will be unto you , if you shall upon your oaths justify , they have done well , and condemn me falsely upon their false verdict , and if you do condemn me , it is upon their false verdict , because i spoke maliciously against Richard Mayo : and you cannot do that , but you forswear yourselves , and acts contrary to your trust , who are set in place to judge justly by what doth appear to your view ; and cannot nor dare not , i know , upon your oaths , say , that i have spoken falsely and maliciously against Richard Mayo ; but and if you do , one day you will feel that you have spoken against your own oaths , and consciences , and against God , and against your own souls . And this is all that i can lay before you , as to this particular , to warn you , that you do judge justly , and that you condemn not the innocent & just cause of the upright , but that you May save yourselves from the anger of the Lord , who will be avenged upon all false swearers and unrighteous judges , that judges not in righteousness the cause of the poor , and of the stranger ; and the cause yet remains before you , to show yourselves just or unjust , righteous or unrighteous judges in this matter . And whereas Richard Mayo , and some of yourselves spoke to me , to confess i have wronged him , and would have me to acknowledge that i am in a fault , and that i have spoken wrong of him ; yea , it was said to me , if i had not wronged him , could i not confess that i had , to preserve myself ? &c.  

To this i must answer ; nay , i cannot confess contrary to a good conscience , and contrary to truth , that i have wronged him ; if my life stood upon it , as it is but my liberty at most , for God hath given me to make conscience of my words , and to keep it void of offence towards him and all men , and to confess that which is false , to be true , would stain a good conscience , in the sight of God and his persons , and that i May not do , no not for my own preservation , and the Lord deliver me from the judgement of such who would have me confess that which i am not guilty of , for that is all one to say i am clear , when i am guilty , as to say i am guilty , when i am clear ; and i rather choose to suffer what can be imposed upon me , then to transgress the truth , in my own heart , and if i should say , his doctrine were sound and true doctrine , and not damnable and error , i do believe the witness in your own consciences would rise against me , and many more would say , i then spoke falsely , than doth now ; for i hardly ever heard any , no not your own selves say , that his doctrines alleged by me against him , are sound and true doctrine , neither can you in good conscience say it ; so i say , i cannot lie against my conscience , what ever comes of it , for to walk with the Lord , and to have his peace , and not to loose his presence , is of more worth to my soul that is immortal , than all the sufferings that you can lay upon me , can be damage to my mortal body ; for my life and soul you cannot touch , but therein am i free , though outwardly entangled amongst briars and thorns , which would pierce me and seek to catch me , and if there be no other way for me to be preserved , but by confessing contrary to my conscience , that i have wronged Richard Mayo , i freely give up myself to suffering , rather than to be preserved by such means , and you do evil in putting such a thing upon me , and expecting it from me , which i cannot give , but transgress the law of God , and offend him , and my own conscience , and if you defer the determination of the matter , upon such hopes , that i May confess that i have wronged Richard Mayo , i desire , you would not defer it one moment longer , but let me be quitted of your temptation , for it is your temptation and not true love ; for i cannot confess any such thing , though thus i do acknowledge , it hath now depended in your court , and at your door , near two years , and i should be glad that it were ended justly , because i am not a man given to suits in law , neither do i love it ( Though it be so that i am fallen into it ) to offend any man , or be offended in that way by any , yet May i not use any unlawful means , or indirect way to obtain an end of this business , but the rather i am content with what the Lord suffereth to come to pass , though it be the very greatest malice of my very devouring enemies , and because i would have peace with all men , and have all men reconciled to God , and one to another to live in love and unity one with another , upon that account i would this business were ended , and though i do not doubt my cause , nor am faint of it , but can freely receive the determination thereof in the court , be it for me or against me , yet i would have it ended , and have sought it in justice , and once did to my adversary say , i could refer it to any sober men ; and another friend being with me , Oliver then protector , or Charles Fleetwood or col.  Pride , all these was mentioned , and to any of these , i could freely have referred my cause , and though before he seemed willing , and said that if any sober man in the nation , that was no Quaker , would say that his doctrine was not sound , and that he had not wrong , &c.  But when these men were mentioned , he was unfaithful to his word , and would not refer it . 

And also not long ago , a day and time was appointed by his own advice and consent , by a friend of his own , to bring the cause before alderman Tichburn , to which i was willing , and that he with some other man Might here and determine the matter , and at the time appointed we met at the alderman's house , and the alderman with some more of us waited for Mayos coming , till near the 9th hour in the evening , and he never came , so ungrateful and unjust was he to his own friend , to alderman Tichburn , and to me , that we waited all for him some hours , and he came not at all , though his own friend , by his own consent and desire did bring that appointment about ; and thus i would have you to know , that i seek peace with all men , and with him , upon just and equal means , & can refer it to honest men to hear and determine ; for who are truly just towards God , cannot condemn me nor my cause ; and likewise ye May see how unwilling my adversary is to bring his business to hearing and determining by wise and descreet men , and how unfaithful he is to his own words and desires , only he thinks he hath gotten a verdict that will do something for him , & upon that he depends , waiting also for your unjust judgement , and because he hopes always for your judgement , which i say is unjust , if you condemn me in this matter ; therefore he will not bring his cause to be heard and determined by any other , because he supposes you will proceed according to that unjust verdict , which if you do not , you offend him , and loseth his unjust cause ; and if you do , you offend God , and condemneth the guiltless cause of the just , and whatever ye do , this follows upon ye , and if you offend God and despiseth the cause of the innocent , and the truth , ye must bear your own burden , in the sight of God and just men ; and if his cause were good , he need not thus shrink and falter , to let any man hear the matter , but his hope of your unjust judgement nourisheth his heart in his unrighteous cause . 

And these things were in me to lay before you , that it May not be said by you , we know not these things , for i would have you to know them and take notice of them , and to compare all things in equality , & to judge according to the law of God , and the good law of this land ; i am not careful at present to answer or say more to you about this matter , only this remains with me ; the Lord God can deliver me from the teeth of the wicked if he will , but if he will not , i cannot bow to the devil , but hath given up my life , to live to him , or to suffer for him ; and this testimony remains for ever ; not as i will , but as he will , who brings all things to pass , according to his pleasure ; 

I am a lover of your souls , and a sufferer for the elect seeds sake , and a witness against the malice and injustice of evil men , Edward Burrough . 

The end . 

The cause why this is first printed , before it come to your hands , is , because i would not give cause of suspi•••• that i seek any thing in secret or underhand of you . But would have all things come to light and public view , for i love the light , and the truth ; to be justified thereby , or to suffer for the testimony thereof .
