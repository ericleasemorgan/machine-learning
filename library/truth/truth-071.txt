THE WORK OF God's Power in Man , WITH Something that the Spirit of Truth leads to practise , and what it leads to deny . 

Given forth in love to the Seed that yet lies in bondage under the Works of darkness , that all who are professing God and Christ in words , and observing forms out of the power , may behold the work of the power , and that such amongst them who breathes after God , may be informed into the right way , and come into unity and fellowship with the Saints in Light , who in the power inherit the blessing . 

The way of God is not as the way of man : Therefore let all consider their way .

The Work of God's Power in Man , etc.  

Man being fallen and degenerated from the Life and Power of God in which he was created good , he is become an evil-worker , filled with evil thoughts , words and deeds , his heart and mind unclean , defiled and polluted ; his soul burdened , oppressed and afflicted ; and here man lies in the mire of uncleanness , and there is not a whole part in him , but wheresoever he lieth down , he defiles himself ; and yet in this state he would be comprehending God and Christ , and in his fallen wisdom would be applying the benefits of Christ for his comfort and satisfaction ; not at all considering that he is alienated from God by evil works , nor regarding the power of God in himself by which the evil works are destroyed , for of a truth , man must be changed by the power of God , if ever he come to be truly happy ; that nature must be killed which is alive , and that must be quickened and raised which is in death , or man cannot inherit the Kingdom of God ; therefore all ye that profess God and Christ , and Christianity , and are not yet changed into the nature of that which ye do profess ; consider seriously this short Testimony unto the Power of God , and the Work of it in man  

1.  There is a time in which God visiteth the sons and daughters of men ; for he beholds all people in the fall , out of the right way , and his tender compassion moveth , and his love openeth , and with the Light of his Life he let's man see the evil of his doings ; for it is a certain truth , that the love of God is tendered unto man in the Light , which doth discover his sin , and that is the day of his Visitation , wherein God willing to make known his lovingkindness unto man , he sends his only begotten Son , who is the true Light , that all in him might believe and all by him might come to life ; and seeing that man ennot hide any thing so secretly , but that something in him doth find it out , then let him believe that it is of God which so discovers his secret intents ; for it is God that searcheth the heart , and there is not another way that leads unto life , but the Light which from the Life is made manifest ; for Christ is the Light , the Way , the Truth and the Life ; and all other ways lead from the Truth and from the Life ; and whosoever rejects the Light , they reject the Love of God , the way to God , and the Truth of God , and so rejects Christ by whom they should come to God ; for Christ is the way to God , and there is ●ot another ; and his Light is manifest from the Love and Life ●o● God , to convince every man that in sin abideth . And this is the time of convincing . 

2.  There is a time when man comes so to be smitten by the Light of Christ in his Conscience , as that he is brought to stand still and consider his way , and with the Light he comes to see the evil of his doings , and there he feels the Light to be a Witness against him , and a Reprover of him , and so comes to be made sensible of his own wretchedness and misery , and to feel the burden lie upon him , and the sin every way to beset him ; and then the cry rises in him , Who shall deliver me from the body of sin and death ? then he begins to look who shall appear for him , and help him in his distress , and who shall deliver him out of the trouble and affliction wherein he lies ; his sin is now his burden ; and that which he hath had pleasure in , is loathsome to him , and he groans under the weight of it , and travels in pain in the sense of great oppression ; and here he is compassed about with grief , trouble and sorrow , all his sins come up in order before him , and the Light of Christ stands a Witness against him , and executes Judgement upon him , and he knows not which way to look for comfort , he feels the hand of God correcting him , and the stripes to fall upon him , and which way soever he would escape , he is pursued ; peace he cannot come unto , rest he cannot find , and so is made willing to fall into the hand of God , seeing that all his own strength cannot help him ; and without Christ appear for his redemption , he is miserable for ever ; and so the Candle of the Lord being lighted in man , he comes to see every corner of his own House , and all secret things that have been wrought and acted in darkness , they all come into his view , and there man sees himself defiled , polluted and unclean , and sees that no unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of God ; and so he begins to abhor himself , and come to repentance for all the evil that he hath done , and the sin that he hath committed , and begins to wait in the Light to receive power over his corruptions , and so comes to harken to the voice which reproves him , which is the voice of Christ , and begins to regard when reproof comes , and there his heart comes to be touched with the power of Christ , and with the power is turned from the evil unto the good : And this is the time of Conversion . 

3.  There is a time when the Power works Redemption , by drawing and leading man out of the sin , and so he comes to forsake the evil of his own way , and the devices of his own heart , and begins to feel the power working in him , and redeeming him out of those things wherein he hath lived , to himself ; and deaths shadow begins to be broken , and the life begins to rise and come up into some liberty , and then man knows his Redeemer life's , and the Power gives him ease where he hath been burdened , and sets him free where he hath been captivated , and so the Power helps him where he cannot help himself , and delivers him where he cannot deliver himself ; and the Power strikes over that Nature in Judgement , in which sin is conceived and nourished , and so makes man conformable to the death of Christ , and brings him into fellowship with his sufferings , and so he is made one with Christ in his death and sufferings , by which he comes to the virtue of his resurrection ; and there his death and sufferings is known , by passing through the same in the Work of the Power , by which Power Redemption is wrought out of that nature which is evil , into that nature which is good , and so man comes to be redeemed up to God by the Work of his Power , and enters into the Power , where he receives true Faith , and by Faith in the Power he obtains victory over the sin which hath been his burden , and by the power he begins to rise in the immortal Seed , and there feels Christ to be the resurrection and the Life , and by his resurrection and life Man is redeemed out of death , and is made a partaker of the riches of his Grace , in which all the benefits come to be witnessed , to the comfort and satisfaction of the soul ; and so Christ is made Redemption unto all that in his power believe . And this is the time of Redemption . 

4.  There is a time when the Power works salvation , in saving from the sin out of which it redeemeth ; for Christ is the Power of God to salvation ; and by his Power he rebuketh temptation , so that when temptations would draw the mind into those things again out of which there is Redemption , than the Faith standing in the Power , and the eye looking unto Christ by Faith , he appears to save from the sin which the temptation would draw into ; and here Christ is felt to be a Saviour that saves his people from their sins , ( mark ) saves his people from their sins ; for they are his people that are redeemed by him : And though there be a liablenesse to temptations after Redemption be witnessed , yet abiding in the Power , they are his people , and he is their salvation , and so he keeps them by his mighty power through Faith , he keeps them out of the evil , and keeps them in the good ; and so he that believes , is saved , he doth not enter into temptations , though temptations may be presented to him , but is kept and saved by the power ; for as Redemption draweth out of the sin , so doth Salvation save from the sin , and yet the same Power ; for it is not one thing that redeems , and another thing that saves ; but it is the Power which worketh effectually in both ; and so Christ a Redeemer , and Christ a Saviour , and they that are saved by him , they rejoice in his salvation , for he brings salvation in the creatures weakness ; and this is his salvation , wrought by the Arm of his Power ; for if people do not feel Christ to be nearer to them for Redemption and Salvation , then where they apprehend him to be without them , they cannot feel the joy of his salvation ; for temptations are within , and if Christ be not there also to rebuke them , and save from them , there is no man can prevail by his own strength ; but where the mind joins to his power within , and stands in his power , there is eternal salvation obtained . And this is the time of salvation . 

5.  There is a time when the Power works Regeneration ; for having converted , redeemed and saved , it hath a free course in man , and works effectually for the changing and renewing of him , striking over all the old Nature , and the deeds of it , and crucifies them down into the death , and buries them in the baptism of sufferings , where man becomes a dying man , dies to the World , dies to his Will , his Wisdom , his Apprehensions and conceiving ; and the Power crucifies man unto all , and all unto man ; and he passeth through death in the operation of the Power ; for the Power passeth through the whole man , kill the lusts , burning the chaff , consuming the dross , and dissolving the Earth , and raiseth man out of the earthly habitations , and so cuts off the seed of the evildoer , and takes away the sin ; and there the first Adam dies , and the second Adam rises , and bringeth up the immortal soul in his hand ; and then all things are made new by the Work of the Power , a new birth is born , which hath a new heart , mind and tongue , from which proceedeth new thoughts , words and deeds ; for behold , the Work of the Power maketh all things new , and so man cometh to be regenerated and born again of in corruptible Seed , which is a mystery to all apprehenders and conceivers ; he dies to self , and receives a new life in Christ , and hath a new Name given him , which no man can read but he that hath it . And this is the time of Regeneration . 

5.  There is a time when the Power worketh sanctification , by cleansing all that out of man which hath defiled him ; for the fire consumes , but the water cleanses , and so purgeth the Conscience , and purifieth the heart , and maketh man clean within ; for Christ prepareth the soul as a Bride for her Husband , sending forth his pure Water to wash away all spots and stains , and so puts on the Garment of his Righteousness , and in the Life of his own Righteousness he beholdeth the soul , and is in love with it , and so marrieth it to himself in a perpetual Covenant never to be broken ; then he that sanctifieth , and they that are sanctified , are all of one ; Mercy and Truth is met Righteousness and Peace kisseth each other ; and here man is made the Righteousness of God in Christ , and so is righteous even as he is righteous ; for it is Christ that now liveth in man , and is righteous in man , and is made righteousness unto man , in which righteousness the Saints are approved and accepted of God : Oh! let not any grow wise by apprehension , for I am not answering that part , my love is to the Seed , and my heart is broken in the sense of what I now write ; but I am not to write much concerning these Mysteries , left any should take them up , and say it is done : But let all know , That this is the time of Sanctification . 

7.  There is a time when the Power worketh Justification , having brought man unto God , and made him acceptable unto God , he is then justified before God , for he is married unto Christ , and is one with Christ ; and in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation , and if no condemnation , than justification ; for that which is condemned , is not justified ; neither is that which is justified condemned ; but that which is sanctified , is justified : For man in the first Adam cannot be justified , but in the second Adam he is sanctified , accepted and justified , and in his Life man in herits the peace , and the joy , and the blessing . And this is the time of Justification . 

Now as this Work is wrought in man by the power of God , he comes to enjoy the fullness of Truth which is in God , for God is Truth in fullness ; and the Spirit by which the Truth is measured forth and manifested , it is the Spirit of Truth ; and as the Truth is received in the spirit 's manifestation , so the mind is constrained into obedience ; and the Spirit being answered in obedience , it leads up into a larger measure of the fullness , and by degrees it bringeth into the fullness ; for the Spirit of truth leads into all truth , ( mark ) into all truth ; and being all , there is nothing wanting , which being attained in the leading of the Spirit , the soul comes into everlasting rest in God : And so by the leading of the Spirit there is a growth in the truth , and a passing on from one degree to another , until the fullness be enjoyed , and all are to mind the measure of truth in which they stand , and to answer the movings and leading of the Spirit , that in the truth they may grow and prospero ; for as the truth is lived in according to measure , there is a growth to be felt and witnessed in it , a growth in understanding , growing up from children to young men , and from young men to ancients , and so in understanding come to be men , not by apprehension and conceiving , but by revelation and possessing ; and as the growth comes to be felt in the truth , so there is a decay of all that which is out of the truth ; and that which hath been manifested by any practice out of the truth , that comes to die ; for as the root is destroyed , so doth the branches die , and then the Truth brancheth forth in its own nature , and manifests itself according to its nature , and that is the principal of all good works ; and the good works which are wrought and manifested by it , they are of God , and being of God they are truth ; for there is not any thing besides him true : And all good works that are wrought in him , and manifested from him , they are approved by him ; and so they that have true faith , they have good works also , yea such good works as may be seen of men : So that the practice in the truth is from the principle of truth , by all that are of the truth : And though something of such a practice may be observed by such as are out of the truth yet that doth not make the practice in the truth to be ever the lesle glorious in itself ; for it is the principle that makes the practice true , and not the practice that makes the principle true : But where the practice of any doth wholly degenerate from the practice in the truth , that principle doth plainly manifest its nature by what is practised , and neither principle nor practice is true : But where the practice of truth stands in the principle of truth , there is the nature of the root manifested by the branch , and so the Tree is good , and the fruit is good . And will not many speak well of the Life of such as live in the practice of truth , and yet speak evil of their principle , and so would make the fruit good , and the tree corrupt , which thing cannot be : for not any thing that is truly good , can proceed from that which is evil , as the ground of its conception . So if the life of such as are guided by the Light , do not answer their principle in all righteousness , than people might have some cause to say , that their principle is delusion , and they a deluded people ; but if it be so as their lives do sufficiently demonstrate , then let all people acknowledge that their principle is truth , and that God is their God , and that they are his people . So let all people consider their way , and behold what they practise ; for the Spirit of truth leads into all truth , and so brings forth good fruit in all holiness and righteousness of life , and that life spring's from the Spirit as from its root , and is made manifest as it is the Work of God , and it answereth the righteous principle of God in every man ; and that which is manifested by the Spirit of Truth , and practised by those that live in the truth ; and also what they cannot practise as being out of the truth , are these things following . 

1.  They worship God in spirit and truth ; but the evil worship they cannot observe : They bow to the Name of Jesus , and cannot bow to any graved Image ; for the Name of Jesus is their life . 

2.  They live a godly and righteous life , walking in sobriety , moderation , temperance , meekness , gentleness , patience , love , justice , mercy and truth ; they do unto all men as they would be done unto . 

3.  They honour God alone , and honour all men in the Lord ; but they cannot give flattering titles unto men , nor respect persons in the vain customs . 

4.  They are conformable unto Christ ; but they cannot conform to fashions and traditions ; they cannot live in the lust of the flesh and the pride of life ; they cannot be excessive in meats , drinks and apparel ; but what is needful , they use it in its place , but cannot use any more . 

5.  They speak the words of truth and soberness ; but that which is out of the Truth they cannot speak ; for You to one , is not in the truth ; but thou to one , is in the truth ; and they speak it as it is the Language of the Spirit . 

6.  Their word is truth in what they speak , and they faithfully answer what they promise ; but they cannot be bound by bonds of men to cause them to perform what they may require ; for by their word they are bound to perform if they make a promise ; for their word is truth . 

7.  They testify the truth when they are required ; but they dare not swear at all : They love Christ , and keep his command ; and they cannot answer what is commanded contrary ; for all his commands are righteous unto them , and they choose to obey him rather than men . 

8.  They love the Lord God and one another ; but the wickedness of the wicked their souls abhor : They are truly tender to that which is good in all ; but they cannot join with that which is evil ; for the good is their rest . 

These things , with much more of this nature , is practised by such as are led by the Spirit of Truth , and is manifested from the Spirit as fruit of its nature ; and where it is not so , the Spirit of Truth doth not lead ; and so people profess Christ , but conform to the customs and fashions of the world , which they that are led by the Spirit , cannot do ; for the Spirit teacheth them to deny all customs of the world , which are vain ; and not only so , but teacheth them to testify against the World , and the deeds of evil which by them are observed ; and this is good fruit brought forth from the good Tree , and is not like the corrupt fruit of the corrupt Tree ; and so the Tree is known by its fruit , for thereby doth every Tree manifest its nature . 

Now let him that readeth , understand , for this is declared that all may believe that Christ is the Power of God , and that the Power of God is in man , and that the Power of God worketh the Work of God ; for you that cannot endure to hear of the Light and Power of Christ within , you will not endure sound Doctrine , but cry out against it as the greatest delusion ; and you say your Faith is in Christ without you , and you be-believe that by his death he hath done all for you , and by his blood you are justified , and by his imputed righteousness you are accepted . Now consider the ground of your Faith , who is the Author of it , and how was it wrought , seeing there is but one true Faith , and seeing that true Faith stands in the power of God , and seeing Christ is the power of God according to Scripture : Now is your Faith within you or without you ? if within you , than Christ is there also , for he is the Author of true Faith ; if without you , than it cannot purify your hearts , which is the Work of Faith , for faith purifies the heart ; and if you will not have Christ within you , than not faith within you , and then not pure hearts , and what good doth all your apprehensions do you , if you cannot witness pure hearts ? they that are in the unbelief , can but lie there : And what better are you by your Faith , than they that that have no Faith at all ? For all men have not Faith. This is in tender pity to you , that you might once look within , and have regard to that which doth reprove you ; for that which cries peace when there is no peace , will not do you any good ; that was ever the Message of the false prophets , to cry peace to that nature which lived and ruled over the good Seed , and that never did people any good , but became a hindrance to them for following on to know the Lord , and they wanted peace in the latter end ; let no such Message strengthen you where you are , nor persuade not yourselves thereby that you are what you are not , for if you do so , you do but deceive yourselves , and there is no greater danger then to grow strong in that part which God will break , and wise in that part which God will destroy ; and whosoever strengthens you in that nature , and cries peace to you there , they are such as run when God sends them not , and they only please that life which must come to death . 

Friends , the truest love is in plain dealing , there is no deceit in that , but the truth is spoken to every state and condition as it is ; and though there may be a part that likes not reproof , yet the love reaches to something that lies under that which is reproved ; for all people would have love ; and mercy , and peace , but they start aside when reproof comes , that is , the sound doctrine , which they will not endure ; and though love , mercy and peace be in God , yet the birth of the flesh is not therein concerned , and therefore it must be reproved before the love , mercy and peace of God be obtained for you that talk so much of Justification by Christ , whilst you are not changed and renewed by the work of his power , you have yet a large journey to go before you can come to that place where Justification is witnessed , for he doth not justify any in sin , though he justify the ungodly , which is a sentence often urged as a proof for justification in ungodliness ; and where such doctrine is received , it gives the flesh an occasion to use its liberty ; for a man may sometimes have been ungodly , and such were some of you , saith the Apostle ; but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus , & by the Spirit of our God , 1 Cor. 6. 11.  ( Mark ) here was not justification in the ungodliness , but here was washing and sanctifying , and then justifying such as had been ungodly , justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus ( mark that ; ) for Abraham as pertaining to the flesh , found nothing , but believing in God , he found the Seed , and his Faith was counted unto him for righteousness ; and being come to the righteousness by faith , the reward was reckoned not of Works , and so a debt ; but it was reckoned of Grace , and Abraham was justified in the righteousness , and not in the ungodliness , and so he received the sign of Circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had , yet being uncircumcised , who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the Father of many Nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy Seed be : Therefore to apply justification by Christ whilst people are found sinners , is to exclude the Work of Christ in man , who appeareth to take away sin , and to bring in everlasting righteousness , and to justify man in his own righteousness ; for in no other thing can man stand justified before God who is righteous , and this is a Truth shall stand for ever . And they go on too fast that would be justified before they submit to reproof ; for Christ must be received as he is a reprover , before any can know him as a justifier ; and so man being filled with his apprehensions , he is vainly puffed up with his fleshly mind , and knows nothing concerning Christ as he ought to know ; for people in that state are too high , their apprehensions of justification lists them up , and they will not stoop nor bow to such a low degree as to reproof , they are too wise in their own eyes by their apprehensions , and filled too full with their own conceiving , and so loses the sense of hunger and thirst after Christ , and that which should live by him , is in want of him ; for where can any come to feed upon Christ , if they find him not within them ? How can they eat his flesh and drink his blood , if he be not within them ? And can any have life in him if they do not eat his flesh and drink his blood ? Or can any eat that flesh that was crucified in times past , and drink that blood which was shed , as it is flesh and blood without them ? Nay , nay , there must be a nearer communion with Christ ; if any eat his flesh , and drink his blood , they must feel him to be within them , and his fan must go in his hand within them , and his fire must burn up the Chaff , and his water must wash away the uncleanness , and they must be wholly separated from that nature which cannot come into communion with him : And they must be wholly separated from that nature which cannot come into communion with him : And this must all people know before they eat his flesh and drink his blood . 

Therefore all you that profess God and Christ in words , and apprehend your Justification where you are , do not deceive yourselves with such an uncertain hope , for it will fail fail you in the latter end ; and now learn of Christ whilst his love is to you ; learn meekness and lowliness , that your souls in him may find true rest , yea a rest within , and that in this present World ; for you are not at rest amongst your apprehensions , but are tossed with diverse conceiving concerning the Scriptures , and are wearying yourselves in an endless travail ; and though you may apprehend a rest to yourselves , and persuade yourselves that all is well , yet there is a day wherein you will know that it is polluted , and out of that rest you must arise and depart , if ever you come to find rest in Christ : And this is a truth which many can witness this day , who sometimes were likeminded with you , and did apprehend that they were that which indeed they were not , when the mighty day of the Lord broke forth in them , they were made sensible of the sparks of their own kindling , and the light of their own fire , in which they were walking , and were made to cry unto the Lord in bitterness of spirit , who appeared to be a God gracious and merciful to them , and with the Arm of his Power plucked them as brands out of that fire , and in judgement and mercy hath gathered them into his own Covenant ; and in what principle stands your fellowship if it stand not in the Light ? Or can there be any true fellowship but in the Light ? Must there not be a perfect principle where there is a perfect unity ? And is not the Light of Christ perfect ? And must not the heart , mind and soul be bound together in the Light , if there be perfect unity ? Was the Saint's unity and fellowship in any other principle ? Or did they hold forth unity with such as did not walk in the Light ? Or did they not labour to gather them into their principle , and so into their fellowship ? That ye may have fellowship with us , and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ. Here was their fellowship in the Truth , Light , Life and Power of God ; and they did not say that they had fellowship with such as were not in the Truth , but they held forth the Truth , that such as were out of the Truth might be gathered into the Truth , and come into fellowship with us ; ( Mark ) not that ye have fellowship with us , or we with you where you are , but that ye may have fellowship with us ; and this was true love in the Saints to such as were contrary-minded , yet not such a love as could close in unity , but such a love as did manifest pity ; and it is the same unto you this day : For the Lord knows the labour and travel of all his faithful Servants , Ministers and Messengers , whom he hath raised in the power of his life to preach the everlasting Gospel , upon whom the glory of his Life rests , how that they have not done his Work negligently , but have run to and from in the move of his power , to declare his everlasting Truth , that all might be gathered to the Truth , and come into fellowship in the Truth , knowing in the counsel of the Lord ( whose servants they are ) that no perfect unity or fellowship can be held in any other principle ; and they have never denied fellowship with any that have come to their principle , if it was in never so little a measure , if it was in the Light and Truth , they could have unity with them there , yea , with the weakest breathing , and lowest desire after the Truth , their souls have ever rejoiced to meet with any there , and their love and tenderness have ever been abundantly manifested to all simple hearted ones , though in practice they have lain different from them at present , for they have fell to the Seed where it hath been , and in tender compassion hath ever been ready to help and relieve the distressed ; but they could never speak peace to the oppression ; and God doth abundantly reward them for their service and labour of love , and by the mighty Power of God through their Ministry , many sons and daughters are come to glory , who are in perfect love , peace and unity together , and established in everlasting righteousness , in the unchangeable Seed of God. So all must come to the Power of God , that come unto perfect unity , otherwise they are but in the changeable nature , and in the changeable unity ; but where the power is submitted unto , it works out the changeable nature of the flesh , and raises the unchangeable nature of the Lamb , and gathers the heart , mind and soul into union with him , and so makes a complete and perfect body , in his complete and perfect life , where all drinks into one spirit , and feeds upon one bread : And here the unity is held in the Spirit , and it is sealed in the bond of peace . Therefore feel the power of God in yourselves , that your minds be subjected into stillness and quietness ; for you are too full of business , always thronging and cumbring yourselves about many things , which draweth you from the one thing which should make you happy . O that you would once harken and obey ! How well would it be with you to what it is ! For really there is a pity reaches to you , and many sad complaints are taken up for you , considering what longings and pant there hath been in many of you after God. O remember the years past , when your visitation was upon you , and the springing of God's love was fresh in you , than were you broken , and melted , and humbled before the Lord , and you had a fervent zeal for God according to what you knew , the daystar did rise unto you , but you was not acquainted with it , nor did not understand that it would have led you where the young child was , and so not regarding , you lost the sight of it , and turned your faces towards the West , where the Sun setteth in obscurity : Oh! shall you not be lamented because of this ? yea surely you are , and through the lamentation there is compassion to that which first breathed in you , and through the compassion there is judgement issue's forth to that Spirit which hath betrayed you ; and here I may include all such as have lost their first Love , whether by apprehending Christ without them or within them ; for there stands the Traitor in all , to draw the mind into apprehensions and conceiving , and so from waiting upon God in the principle of his Light and Life , there to be kept in the fresh sense and feeling of the pleasant streams that issue from the fullness , and so to grow and increase through the virtue and nourishment thereby received ; and how hath apprehensions and conceiving come over that sweet dispensation of Love , yea and Life in measure , which in years past was felt by many ? And how doth death reign in them ? And how is the precious Seed of God oppressed ? O that you would consider , whoever you are that have let in apprehensions and conceiving of Christ , whether you apprehend him without you or within you ! the birth of his life you do not know in that state ; for none can compass his pure life by any apprehension ; therefore let all cease from their apprehensions and conceiving ; and with the power of God silence all flesh , and wait to feel the Work of the power in you , and be faithful to the power , and then you will know Christ of whom you speak , and dare speak no more than what you can witness , nay , nor that neither , but as the life moveth to do it ; for what good doth all your words that you speak with the old tongue ? Can they reach any deeper than the old nature ? Or is their service any more than to build up that which God will throw down ? Were it not better for you to be still and silent , then to cumber yourselves in so much business that profits nothing at all ? O that you would once come to be silent to the flesh , that you might feel the quickening of the Spirit ; and to that state you must come , if ever you be truly happy ; for mercy apprehended , will not satisfy your souls , but mercy obtained in the election through judgement to the reprobation , is that which stands sure for ever ; and they that so obtain mercy with the Lord , they truly rejoice in mercy , and wait to be preserved in it ; for there are too many words spoken with the old tongue , and there is a time when every man 's own words will become his burden ; therefore do not increase your burden by multiplying your own words , for certainly they all gender to bondage , the innocent life groans under them ; for every word spoken , and not in the life , is a burden to the righteous Seed ; and if you yet say in your hearts , Our tongues are our own , we will prevail , who is Lord over us ? You will certainly know your burden will be too heavy to bear in the later end , and though you may bring Scriptures that doth allow to speak of the things of God , and to exhort one another , and edify one another , and build up one another , yet you cannot bring any Scripture that doth allow the old tongue to do it , neither can it be truly so done by it ; for they that spoke of the things of God , and exhorted one another , & edified one another according to Scripture , they witnessed their change out of the old nature , and were come to the silence of all flesh , and they were of the new birth , which was not of flesh , nor of blood , nor of the will of man , but of God ; and the tongue of the new birth spoke to edification and comfort of the body ; for it is the first born of God that speaks the things of God ; and so they exhorted one another , and edified one another ; who were born of the Seed of God. And this you must come unto , if ever you know the tongue of the learned ; for whilst you speak of yourselves , you are but seeking your own glory ; but he that seeks the glory of him that sends him , the same is true , and there is no unrighteousness in him ; therefore do not hunt in Nimrod's nature to build Babel , but feel the power of God to bridle your tongue ; for if the tongue be not bridled the Religion is vain ; and if you will but come to that , than you will know the sweetness of a silent , quiet state , where God's presence is felt , and his life enjoyed , where all man 's own words have their period ; for they that come to the life , they need not be always learning , but sit in the sweetness of the savour that the life ministers from its own fullness ; and when words are spoken from the life , they have the sweetness of the life in them , and are precious and savoury to the life in all , and the life is the last Ministration that ever shall be , and all below it , are to come up into it ; for where any fall short of it , their labour will end in sorrow . O therefore be humble before the Lord God , and stand submitted unto his power , that ye may come to his life ; who have any breathe after life , and spend not your days in the multitude of your own words , lest you finish your work in a shadow , and miss the substance which should do you good . So be humble in the fear of God , that ye may feel the time of refreshing come from his presence ; and do not covet after riches , but wait in the poverty to be fed with God's mercy ; for it is better to be a doorkeeper in the House of God , then to dwell in the Tents of wickedness : And all that would enter into the Courts of the Lord's House , and come to feed at the Table of the Lord , they must enter in by the Power , and sit down in the Power , where all the Lambs and Babes are fed with plenty ; for the Famine is without the Gates , but within there is all things good for food , the feast of fat things is there prepared , and thither must all come that receive the Bread of life . 

Well Friends , my love is tenderly to the Seed of God in you , but in that nature where you are , I cannot say that I have unity with you , though I heartily desire that I could say it in truth , yea much rather than to declare the contrary ; but so it is , & so it must be until you be regenerated and born again , which work I wait to see wrought in you , that all the children of Light may so know you , as to say in truth , they have unity with you : Which work I leave with God , who is able in his own time to accomplish what is wanting , and to gather together in one such as are scattered , and to bring them into one Fold , and into one Pasture , where his Name is one , and his people one , not by apprehension and opinion , but in truth and life ; which is the singleness of heart I desire , that so it may be with you before the day pass over , for now it is , therefore prise it whilst it is , lest it pass away from you and be no more . And this is true love to all your souls , that ye in the Light may come into unity with the Saints and Household of Faith , who sit in peace and rest with God , and inherit their portion in the riches of his Kingdom .
