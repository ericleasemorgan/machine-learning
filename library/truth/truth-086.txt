Truth ( The strongest of all ) witnessed forth in the spirit of truth , against all deceit : and pleading in righteousness its own cause , to the understanding of the simple , against a very great number of lies , slanders , perverting of the scriptures , contradictions and false damnable doctrines , held forth by the independents .

To the reader . 

Friend , 

Thou hast here a very great number of * lies and slanders , and unjust dealing , and false doctrines , &c.  laid open and reproved in plainness , and not in hypocrisy , and of contention there is not suddenly an end being begun ; therefore seeing the unbelieving heart of John bunion cannot believe me when i speak the truth in justness , nor May i believe his lies and slanders uttered in hypocrisy ; what is laid down is left to thee , soberly to judge of betwixt us , while we are both silent : and this know the one is a deciever and the other is as a deceiver yet true ; and thus May thou weigh things equally . 

First , considering of many lies and slanders truly charged upon him in my first , of which he is guilty from his first , and he hath not at all cleared himself of them in his second , which an honest man ought to have done , before he had gone further ; for i soberly desired witness of what he said : but be hath added to the number of his wickedness , and not proved justly what he hath said against us : and it is not for his sake , for little hopes i have of his conversion , but the rather that he will be hardened , nor for my own sake as if i were unsatisfied concerning him that this is written , but to undeceive the simple of what his wickedness May falsely suggest into the mind as if all were truth that he spoke , if his wickedness were not reproved . 

Again , consider that i have cleared the truth of my words which he hath wrested and thereby taken occasion against the truth , by answering his own conceptions and not my plain words , so my words ( Which are words of truth ) being defended , all his reply is made void : so i have not so much desired to answer every particular of his words , as to vindicate my own words , and the truth from his false slanders and accusations . 

London , 12. month , 1656.  E. b.  

Truth ( the strongest of all ) witnessed forth in the spirit of truth against all deceit . 

Oh how hath Satan filled the hearts of men , in this generation ( As well as in former ages ) with envy against the truth , and with wrath against the way thereof , and how hath he filled them with craft , and deceitful subtlety , to offend the way of the Lord , in all manner of persecuting , and evil speaking against it openly , and also in secret gainsayings , in hypocrisy , and how are men armed to defend themselves in their naughtiness , laying hide under the veil of fair speeches , and fine arguments , using the scripture in the words of man's wisdom , to oppose the power and life of righteousness , even as the scribes and Pharisees of old , how zealous were they in their observances , and in fulfilling the commands and traditions of their fathers , having set themselves in Moses seat , professing Moses and the prophet's words , and yet persecuted Christ the life , and substance of Moses , and the prophets , and as it was then , so is it now , how are Christ's words , and the apostles professed and preached by such who are enemies of the life of Christ made manifest in mortal flesh , and secretly opposing the doctrine of the apostles , who said , know ye not , that Christ is within you , except you be reprobates . but the mighty day of the Lord is come , and coming , wherein all hearts are made manifest , and the secrets thereof discovered , and the light is springing out of darkness , and the sun is breaking thorough the clouds to give light to all men and nations , and the great whore which hath decked herself in divers colours to deceive , shall be made naked and bare , and the day of great striving is come , and now every man stands up for his interest , to defend his possession , for the just judge standeth at the door , to inquire by what law every man holds his inheritance , and he findeth many holding their religion , and profession , by the traditions of men only , and not by the revelation of Christ Jesus in them , and such he will dispossess , though they strive against him , yet all is in vain , and though they plead antiquity , yet that will not prevail , and in that the day of great striving is come , betwixt the lamb and his followers , the dragon and his followers , every one of that party appearing with such weapons as the devil hath armed them withal , and with such armour as the wicked hath they come , appearing under divers colours , to fight against Zion , yet under one head , and Prince of darkness , and unto one purpose , even that the seed of Jacob May be rooted out , and that the way of truth May not prosper , that then the wicked May go on in their wickedness , without reproof , and ungodliness May be hide under hypocrisy and above all other means , that is used at this day , to keep up the kingdom of the devil , and to offend the kingdom of Christ ; this is chief , striving against the light of the world , opposing it , and denying it , and by crafty arguments , and cunning speeches , seeking suitable scriptures , ( As they suppose ) to ground their false arguments upon , against this very thing , that the light of Christ is given to every man that comes into the world , or that the light which convinceth and reproveth every man of sin within him , is not the light of Christ , nor worthy to be taken notice off , but natural and such like , and no way sufficient to life and salvation ; if the unjust men persecute , it is such as walk in the light of Christ Jesus , that cannot fulfil the wills and customs of men , and so are not of the world , but contrary to it , in all its ways and works which are evil , and if the wise men of the world make any argument , it is against the light , with which Christ lighteneth every man that comes into the world , so that all the envy of the devil , whether under this or that colour and appearance , is against the light of Christ Jesus and them that walk therein , and if the light be but denied , and not balieved in , nor regarded , then May the devil have whole possession of the heart of man , and if the light of Christ Jesus within , be owned and loved , and walked in , than Christ is received , and there the devil is dispossessed , and therefore it stands him upon , above all other things to possess persons against the light within , which Christ hath given , that then he May not be discovered in the heart ; but May keep all his goods in peace , and have quiet possession in his habitation ? Well , be it so , though all men of that kingdom doth gainsay the light of Christ , by this or that way of wickedness , yet it is precious unto us , and i cannot but earnestly contend for it against all gainsayers , and yet strives not for mastery to ourselves , nor to exalt any thing of ourselves , but only the Lord and his truth , which he hath made more dear to us , than either life , or name , or liberty , and though so it be , that this way be spoken evil against everywhere , yet the Lord owneth it , and us who are faithful therein , in the presence of our enemies , to the confounding of the wisdom of this world ; and whereas John bunion hath formerly set himself divers ways to oppose the truth under the account of his great zeal against error ; but especially in a book sometime since , put forth by him , thinking thereby to offend the way of righteousness ; and now a second time hath appeared , with a defence upon his former , called a vindication , &c.  

Of the former and his defence , is more to the laying open his folly , and to the uncovering of his blindness and wickedness , than his first offence given by him , which caused me to write in short four sheets of paper , to clear the truth from what he had spoken against it . 

And now having again a second time appeared in many words without knowledge yet in great zeal , hath brought forth many things reprovable , even lies and slanders , and evil speeches in abundance , yet with great pretence of holiness , and soberness , and he hath not only helped me , but the truth which is my chief , and moving cause , ( That the truth May be clear ) of this my second reply unto him , and not for my own sake in any thing , for i more prize to be accounted a fool , and dispraised in the world , then to be honoured thereby , and when iniquity shall come to an end , and transgression shall be finished , his shall be the kingdom and the inheritance of rest eternal , that hath kept himself clean and pure , from a lying and slanderous tongue , and who hath done righteously and fulfilled the will of God , for it is not every one that saith Lord , Lord , that shall enter into the kingdom , but he that doth the will of the father which is in heaven , and in that day when the book of all consciences shall be opened , and every thing brought to judgement , then shall the light in every ones conscience answer the Lord in the justness of his dealings , and even then ( If not before ) shall this John bunion know the light in all men's consciences is of force ; when he shall be judged and then shall he see , he hath wronged the Lord , and dealt evil against his own soul , in speaking evil of what he hath not known , and in giving false judgement of what he hath not understood , and till that day i leave him ( Without praying for fire to devour him ) only May reprove his lies errors , contradictions and false dealing , and clear the truth from his false charges , and only to the most chiefest things whereof he accuses us , in short i May reply . 

And whereas thou sayst , there is one that hath ventured to stand up against the truth , and hath published a book in which there is a great number of heresies cunningly •ented by him and also many things there falsely reported of thee , to which i answer , that same book published called the true saith of the gospel contended for , &c.  Shall clear itself from this reproach that i have not stood up against any one truth , or uttered any heresy or lie against thee , * but in that book did witness forth the truth against many things falsely laid down by thee against the Quakers , and that same book with soberness read , without partiality and prejudice , doth clear itself from these false aspersions , and prove thee a liar herein , and i leave it to the honest hearted to judge , who reads that book while i with patience and not seeking any revenge , do bear thy reproaches , Counting them greater riches than thy praise . 

And farther thou sayst , only by the way thou thinkest good to mind me of my clothing myself with the words of the prophets and apostles , &c.  

answ. true enough by the way , out of the truth , and out of Christ who is the way , hath thou spoken this , and so hath uttered in falsehood , and by , or out of the way , neither have i clothed myself , and yet am i clothed , with the life of the prophets and apostles , and not only with their words , nor do i fight against them ( Though thou falsely say it ) but bears witness unto them , in doctrine and conversation , and against thee , all the seed of evil doers , and take backe thy own words to thyself , who art in that generation , which hath the words , but art without the * life in the evil life . 

Farther thou sayst , i have broken out with a false testimony of John Burton and thee , at which thou seemest to be much offended , that i should say thou art joined with the broken army of Magog , and hath showed yourselves in the defence of the dragon , against the lamb , &c.  

reply , what needest thou be troubled at this , have i not spoken the truth , and have i not said well herein , for you are joined with all the wicked in the nation , and as liars and swearers and drunkards , persecutes with violence , and as the proud and wanton are filled with scorning and singing wicked rhymes in the streets , even so also are you come in print , and all of you against them called Quakers , the drunkards and swearers they beat , them and abuse them , and cast them as for dead into ditches , with stoning in the high ways , and in the streets beating down with staffs , and the wanton they sing there rhymes in scorn in alehouses , and taverns against them , and thou and thy fellows and generation appears in open print , slandering and reviling them ( Yet in pretence of zeal for God ) and all this you do against us who have the witness that we are of God , and that the whole world lies in wickedness , and now are not you all joined as an army , and do you not show yourselves in the defence of the dragon , * what wrong i have done you , let the upright in heart judge , whether i have given false testimony against you or no , and though you have noted it for a lie in the margin , yet the lie is thy own , who hath gainsaid the truth herein , and called it a lie , and i have dealt justly with thee , in the sight of God and all that know him , and when the book of thy conscience is opened , thou shalt also confess to this thing , when thou standest condemned with them , with whom thou art now joined , against us , who have the testimony that we are of God , and worshippers of the father in the spirit and truth , and my words were spoken by the spirit of the Lord , and that in thy conscience shall witness them , in the day of the Lord ▪ though now thou opprobriously say , * here are flung into the wind . and whereas thou seemesto be greatly offended , that i should say part of the first book is a corrupted grain of Babylon's treasure , &c.  

But have not i spoken the truth herein also , when i say , i have numbered up part of your work and this is the sum thereof , that part which i have numbered viz. your lies and false reproaches against the Quakers , is a corrupted grain ; yea , and of Babylon's treasure too . I am not ashamed of my words , though thou would defend your work by saying , your discourse was of the birth righteousness , death , blood , &c.  And of the second coming of the son of Mary , &c.  

To which i say , these things and the knowledge of them , by the spirit of God , is not Counted by me corrupted nor of Babylon , though now i answer as in my last , the words i own , but thy voice i deny , and knows it to be the voice of the stranger , and for this saying , ha i not , nor never shall have any burden upon my conscien•e , ( Though thou would say it ) but 't is cleared in the sight of God , even though i say all that thou speakest ▪ i deny , or thy speaking of any thing of the kingdom of God ; with thy lying spirit . 

And whereas thou art offended , that i should say you are described to be the flock of Ishmaell , and of the seed of Cain , whose line reacheth to the murdering priests , &c.  

And thou sayst , i am very sensorious , and utterest many words without knowledge , &c.  

reply , yea , your words doth describe your nature , for by your voice i know you , to be none of Christ's sheep , and accordingly i judge , in just judgement , and in true knowledge , and do not falsely censure , nor utter words void of knowledge , and my words shall be witnessed by you in the day of the Lord : envy is of Cains nature and seed , and in that you are , and liars are of Ishmael's stock , and you are guilty of that , let the sober reader try ; and you are among the murdering priests party , and close joined to them , in doctrine and practice especially in writing against us . 

Now no wrong have i done you , that thou needest to be troubled , and seeks to cover yourselves by thy fair words in thy answer as if you were righteous , but all will not hide you , your works make you manifest to be no less than what i have said of you . 

Then farther thou art hot against me , in that i say , you are found enemies to Christ , revealed in his saints , and this thou hast noted it in the margin for false , but thou dost not well to be angry ; it is true , what i have spoken , thy own words do prove it , in saying there was nothing in thee , to be taken notice of ; this was a denying of Christ within , and such as deny him are found enemies to him within , so the lie is thy own , who hast denied truth , let the wise reader judge , and thy many words in a pretending answer will not cover you from the guilt of what i have charged upon you and not falsely , and what i have said hitherto is true , and not false , though thou fainingly say , thou marvels i should be so over-seen , as to utter so many false things in so little a space ; nay , my understanding was open , when i wrote forth that book , at which thou art so tormented , that it hath caused thee some months travellin anguish to clear thyself , and yet cannot be at rest , and thou art over-seen who resists the reproof of thy wickedness . 

Then thou goes about to justify thy brother Burton's words , who wickedly laid it down , as thou immpudently goest to justify it , who joined in his accusation , and slanders Quakers with ranters , and this would thou justify we are one , against my just answer , which denied them in the fourth page of my first where i said , between Quakers and ranters there is no more union &c. then betwixt light and darkness , good & evil , and that answer stands untouched by thee , and is true , and in justifying John Burton's wicked slander , thou art more wicked in comparing the principles , and sayst it will appear they agree in one &c.  

But what a wicked course hast thou taken to clear him , by adding thy own wickedness , let all consider that reads , for do not i desire in plainness in my first , in these words , if thou dare lay * the charge only upon the Quakers , write in plainness , and bring testimony of thy accusation , and thou May receive a farther answer but not a word in plain answer , to this is returned , though soberly desired , neither time nor place , nor witnesses evidenced to clear yourselves , of your first slanders , which had been more honest , then to have slandered , afresh passing over your first , but it seems you cannot clear yourselves in honesty , and so fulfil your wickedness by adding to your lies and slanders , as thou impudently doth in thy comparing the principles of the ranters with the Quakers . 

And to save thy brother from shame & guilt , thou art fallen thyself into the snare , & justly May be judged , to exceed him in wickedness ; and thou sayst , ( With shame to thyself , i repeat it ) that the * Quakers will not own Christ without them , but thou brings not testimony of this asserion , till then , be thou reckoned , and shall be plagued for a liar , which will be for ever for we own him as he is ascended far above all heavens who fills all things , yea and without us too , so that instead of proving the first false accusation , thou adds another slander and the * second thing wherein thou compares them , is unsound for though we witness , ( Yea thousands ) yet we need no man to teach us , but as the anointing with in us , as the saints did 1 John , yet we cry not down the ministry of God , but owns it , and cries down such by whom persons cannot come to the knowledge of the truth , though they be ever learning , who preaches for hire and goes for gifts and rewards , and loves the wages of unrighteousness , and this was the apostles doctrine , as it was ours , and is no heresy ( Though thou May so judge it ) sor we say by the same spirit as the apostles did , they that are of God heareth us who are in the truth , which is but one , and there is not another ; and the apostles which witnessed the saints needed no man to teach them , did exhort them , and yet did not condemn principles by practice . 

Then thou goes on , and says the ranters are not for baptism , and breaking of bread , and are not the Quakers the same ? but what doth this prone , and thou sayst , the ranters are without sin , and how far short of this opinion are the Quakers , and the ranters would not own the resurrection , &c.  

And how say you , do you believe the very bodies shall rise , &c.  

reply , friend this is far short of proving these things upon us , by queryin them to us , let the reader consider : but it May be impudence hath not so wholly eaten out honesty in thee , as that thou dare charge us wholly with these things , but would intrude into us by thy questions , as though the thing were so indeed , but thou May be ashamed of thy work , is this sufficient proof of evil against us , to ask us whether it be so ? what hast thou proved in all this against us ( If we were guilty ) thinkest thou we will accuse ourselves , this is absurdity , and wickedness in thee , falsely to charge us , and to bring no better evidence , but thy bare words ; and as we deny the ranters , so do we thee , and sees you both to be enemies to the life of God : but thy last and chief proof ( As thou thinkest ) that we are one is that the ranters are sinners , and the Quakers are liars , the first i will not vindicate , but this last is disputable , and thy proof of it is first thou sayst , from what thou hast said already , to some pages of my first book , to which i have replied , and leaves it to the reader , only doth say , thou hast not yet proved one lie against me in the sight of God not men , thou art the liar if thou say thou hast and honest men shall be judge betwixt us : and thy second proof is more to the discovering of thy ignorance then yet hath been , and to clear thyself from my * charge against thee ( viz. ) to be a wrester of the scripture , which yet i stand to , thou art fallen into grievious error ; my first charge is true upon thee , that thou perverted or wrested that scripture ; rev. 13. 18. in saying the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world ; for that scripture saith since , or from the foundation of the world , hast thou no more sense , art thou and all thy company so ignorant that you know not betwixt before and since a time , how are you blinded , and yet persists in your wickedness , and will not be reproved , therefore this is a double iniquity in thee , to thy shame remember it , for i have said true , though thou understand it not * there is as much difference , betwixt before , and since in that thing , as betwixt a lie and truth , for to say the blood was shed before the foundation of the world , as thou dost is a very lie but to say it was shed since or from , is truth , and that scripture is truth , rev. 13.  

And thou art the liar , & wrester of it & i have not wronged thee in my first , though thou impudently and ignorantly would clear thyself , and lay iniquity upon me , but further to clear thyself thou sayst , thou said , in God's account it was shed , before the world was : and this is little less than blasphemy , what , is God a hypocrite like thyself ? to account that for truth , which is a lie as i have proved , oh horrid error and perfect blindness ! but this will not cover thee , nor thy shame , from the eye of men , where is thy proof for such a doctrine , that God accounts that which is a lie for truth ? largely is manifest thy folly ; repent if thy heart be not void of shame , for what thou hast spoken herein ; and let the reader understand this difference , thou sayst the blood of Christ , was shed before the foundation of the world , according to that scripture , rev. 13.  I say thou perverts the scripture , and liest grossly in the main thing itself , and saith it is since , or from the foundation of the world ; let the honest judge , and now it is seen , the lie rests upon thy own head ; who wrists the scripture ; and belies the Lord , and me , and goes on in thy wickedness after reproof , and take thou the ranters , they are thy companinons , in lying and sinning , and not ours . 

And further thou art offended that i should say , and would fain reckon it for a lie , that all thy work is a secret smiting , and an obscure shooting against the manifestation of Christ within , which words i own to be truth concerning these , and am not ashamed of them , though thou say , i say falsely , and when the book of thy conscience is opened , thou shalt confess it , only i leave * this to be consideredseriously and judged by them who are spiritual , and they shall be my witnesses , and the lie is of thee and thy father , whose wickedness is sufficiently seen by what is said , if i should say no more ; again thou sayst it is an untruth of thee , to say thou art one of those that do preach for hire , through covetousness making merchandise of souls , my words are not so laid down , thou hast rested them for thy purpose , though it avails nothing : but i said thou art in their steps , that through covetousness with feigned words , makes merchandise of souls and thou art found among them that preaches for hire , and i have spoken the truth herein , let the light in all consciences judge , who are not seared in many things , i Might instance that thou art in their steps , and among them that act such things as further May be proved , and the wisdom of God so fore saw , to keep me clear and my words to be defended , though i expected no less from thee , as to this thing , then is come to pass , but the lie is of thyself , who would deny the * truth ; the next thing that thou wilt charge upon me to be a lie , i pass , here the reader May expect it in its place , and though thou say the ranters and i and my fellows are of the same mind in many things &c.  

To which i reply , their practices i deny , and the ground in which they stand and their false doctrines yet dare we not deny any truth as it is in Christ ; though they , as thou May profess it in words , which is seldom they do , for we have respect unto the truth , for the truth's sake only , but how uncharitable art thou in thy measure and judgement : consider , as if he should say , j. bunion is of the same mind with the Pope in many things ; the Pope holds Christ was born of Mary , and was crucified and raised again , and ascended , &c.  and this holds John bunion , and is of the same mind with the Pope in many things ; and therefore must partake of the same plagues with the Pope as thou said of us , though thou hast by unequal measure thus judged us , yet i render not evil for evil , but in love to thy soul , shows thee thy folly and weakness . 

Then thou goes on having passed by the two * slanders cast upan us , by John Burton , in your first book which i charged you withal in mine to which not one word as to evidence your slanders but hath slipped it over as a foul guilty man , which charge stands upon you both ; that you are slanderers herein , and my first answer i am not ashamed of , though you snarl much about it , and would taint it or undermine it : but thy subtlety is to weak , truth confounds thee and thy simplicity , which is that we prize the Lord Jesus Christ , God man to be precious unto us , and hath owned him alone to be the foundation whom God hath lied , and in his light we are saved , &c.  

As i said in page 7. against which words thou canst not justly except , nor yet prove the contrary and yet as a man that loves to hear thy own tongue , thou lays down many things impertinent as to the cause in hand . 

But it had been more honest to have helped thy brother Burton , from under my true charge and cleared the truth if thou had been able , but thou hast left him in the dirt under the charge of a slanderer ; and art unfaithful to him , and goes about to inquire what it is ( As thou sayst ) to lay Christ for a foundation ; thou confesses what i have said is fairly spoken , and yet thy envious mind and unbelieving heart seems to be offended at my words , and to them that can believe i speak plainly , and doth not beg thy belief , nor any maes , but commends myself to every man's conscience in the fight of God , and knows no other Jesus , nor saviour , nor foundation , than he that John was sent to prepare the way before , who was , and is , and is to come ; who said i am the light of the world , and now my words are defended to be truth in the fight of them that are spiritual ; and thou and such May hear ▪ but must not understand , who have hardened your hearts least you should believe , and therefare is given up to gainsayings , till the wrath of God break out against you ; and let John Burton remember my words , where i said he is fallen into the pit which he digged for another , and he undervalues the Lord Jesus ▪ whose doctrine is to speak truth , but he hath lied and slandered and so is out of Christ the foundation , and undervalues him , who keeps not his sayings , but is a worker in darkness , and not in the light : and as to that where i say , thus much is the mind of the penman's spirit , ( Of the first epistle of the first book ) secretly smiting at the doctrine of true faith and salvation ( To wit ) Christ within , i have said the truth in righteousness , and do own my words though thou say i have done him a great deal of wrong , &c.  

But i leave it to be judged by them that are spiritual , and not unto thee , to give false meaning of my words , and doth not he say in that epistle of some that have been depending too much upon some thing they call Christ , and the righteousness of Christ within them , &c.  

Let the wise in heart judge , whether this be not as i have said , even a secret smiting against Christ within , without which as i have said , there can be no salvation , for he that hath not Christ in him , is a reprobate , and this i speak , not in opposition , but as a testimony of Christ Jesus , that died , and rose again , and ascended , who is within , and without also , and if any preach another Jesus , let him be accursed , and repent , who art in the wrong doing thyself , falsely charging me ; noting in the margin , with speaking falsely , when i spoke the truth , and the false speaking rests at thy door , and is driven thither with the power of truth . 

Then whereas thou would justify thy former wickedness , in charging the Quakers to be decievers , against my just answer * in page 8. of mine ; which stands free from any of thy vain arguments , and uncontrolled though resisted , but it appears my words sticks close unto thee ; and torments thee , and that we are deceivers thou sayst it will easily appear with much impudence confidence , thy arguments we shall try . 

And ( Sayst thou ) first , the Quakers deny the man Christ Jesus without them , and own Christ no other ways but as he is within , &c.  

reply , how impudent art thou in forging lie after lie , and building them up in thy work one upon another , and a wicked course thou takes to clear thy former slanders , truly charged upon thee in my first , even by laying another upon it . 

Friend , by this thy deceitful flander , while thou hast thought to prove us deceivers , hath proved thyself one , even a false accuser , Mayst thou not blush to say we own Christ no otherways , then as he is within ? we own him which was , is , and is to come , who is within us , and without us , as i have said in my first , we own him as the scripture speaks of him , and it is known to the Lord , and in his sight we are approved , whether thou be ieve it or not ; for i beg not belief of thee , but leaves thy double slanders to be read , and judged of , by all honest persons , and in the interim , know it is a bad way to prove us deceivers by thy lies , this the rather is a witness to us that we are of God , and against thee , to be of the devil , who was a liar from the beginning , and thou his child succeeds him ; in lying . 

Thy second proof is , that we are deceivers , because ( Saith thou ) we do persuade souls that Christ is crucified in them , dead within them , kept down with something within them , which was never taught by them that spoke the scriptures , &c.  

reply , these words are falsely laid down , but what thinkest thou of such who Might crucify to themselves * a fresh the son of God , and put him to open shame , as it is written , this they could not do , above stars , they being men upon the earth , and Christ was sent to preach to the spirits in prison , he that can read let him understand this doctrine was preached by them that spoke forth the scriptures , who had the spirit of God , but in blindness i find thee , and i think so i must leave thee : and doth not feed the serpent , yet my words are plain to him that hath an understanding , and an ear open , and deceiver belongs to thee , and at thy door it lies , and thou cannot remove it . 

Farther ( Thou sayst ) we persuade souls that that man that was born of the virgin Mary , is not above the clouds , and the stars , when as the scripture saith a cloud received him out of their sight . 

reply , this is another lie , uttered without fear or knowledge , or honesty , we do not persuade souls to believe any such thing , but bears witness to the truth of that scripture , that a cloud received him out of their sight , and we say he is out of their sight and must appear again in sight , and this is a wicked way of thee , to prove us deceivers , by slandering us , adding more to thy own sin , and the more will be thy burden , in the day of the Lord when plagues and torment is thy portion , from which thou shalt not fly , though now thou be above shame . 

Farther , ( Sayst thou ) we persuade souls not to believe that , that man that was crucified , and rose again , &c.  shall so come again to judgement , as he went away , and shall raise up men and women out of their graves , and cause them to come into the valley of Jehoshaphat , thou sayst we strive to beat souls off from believing this , &c.  

reply , oh how swiftly thy lying tongue runs without fear , as though neither god nor man took notice of thee , or that ever thou should be called to question for them , many lies together thou hast here folded up in one , thy lies i deny , and this to be one ; hast thou set thyself to tell lies oh abominable wickedness Mayst thou not tremble ? when thou considers what thou falsely sayst of us contrary to my words , who said in the truth of my heart , we own him to be what the scripture speaks of him and not otherwise ? it seems thou cannot believe when i speak truth ; i number up thy lies and returns them backe to thee to read , and by all this ; is it not true , that thou art of the same spirit with thy fellow , and abounds more in lies , as i said in my first , his was but about 3 , thine manifold more , but thy lies is no testimony against us , that we are deceivers , but they shall lay heavy upon thee at one day , when we shall be clear , for in the affirmive . 

I further say that , that Christ Jesus that was crucified , and rose again , shall come as he went away to judgement , and the dead shall be raised , and every man shall receive according to their deeds , and he shall set to judge the heathen round about , according to Joel 3. and thy portion in that day shall be howling and gnashing of teeth , for the liars portion is the lake . 

Thou sayst again the Quakers make no difference between that light , wherewith Christ as he is God hath enlightened all , and the spirit of Christ he gives not to all . 

reply , i put thee to prove that they are contrary or divided one against the other , for thus Christ saith , i will send you the comforter even the spirit of truth , which must needs be the spirit of Christ and he shall reprove or convince the world of sin , and of righteousness ; now mark that same spirit of the father and of the son , who is the comforter of the saints is the same , and not another that doth reprove the world , he that can read let him understand the world cannot receive the comforter yet have they given to them that which doth reprove them ; which is with the light of Christ Jesus , of the same , and not contrary nor divided ; if thou hast an ear , thou May hear , the error is in thyself who art without understanding . 

Further thou sayst , they say that every one hath that which is like the spirit of Christ , even as God , as the spirit of Christ , which thou sayst is desperate blasphemy , and cries out with an outcry , oh wonderful deceit ! &c.  

reply , i would have all to take notice , that thou hast wronged my words , in wresting of them for thy wicked purpose , to have a ground of slander , there is no such words in the tenth page of my book , which thou quoatest , but in one place , i say , till thou prove the light of Christ John 1. 9  ( Which thou confesses every man hath ) to be contrary to the spirit of Christ , ( Mark ) i shall say every man hath that which is one in union , and like the spirit of Christ , even as good as the spirit of Christ , according to its measure ; these words i must own . 

But let the sober reader take notice how foully thou hast wronged my words * leaving out the strength of them , to take occasion of slander , when thou had proved the light of Christ ( Which in John 1. 9 is spoken of ) to be contrary to the spirit of Christ , then had been a better season , for this charge against me : 

Oh thou impudent and shameless man ! so unjustly to deal against the upright , who envies thee not but pities thee therefore when thou or any man can prove the light of Christ spoken of John 1. 9 and John 8. 12. to be contrary to the spirit of Christ , than i May own the judgement and charge upon me , but till than thou art proved a liar ; for the light of Christ spoken of John 1. 9 that light is one in union , and not contrary , and is of the likeness of the spirit of Christ , and as * good in its measure , and these words i stand to , to vindicate against all thy lies , and wresting of words and outcries , who is an unfit fellow to judge what blasphemy is , who is so blind that thou knowest not the difference of words , betwixt , before , and from , as i have showed : 

Repent , if so be thou May find mercy . 

Then further thou sayst to cover myself and deceit , i do apply , that which should be to the children of God , &c.  And yet cannot reprehend my answer , which is just and faithful , that the children of God were always Counted deceivers , and this is true , as thyself confesses but wickedly saith in thy answer , and most lyingly too , and blasphemy is fallen out of thy mouth , the devil knows how to take children's bread , and cast it to dogs . 

reply , now let all consider what thou hast said , Christ Jesus is the bread of life that came down from heaven , the children's bread , and they have no other , now the devil cannot take Christ Jesus who only is the children's bread , and give him to dogs , oh horrid ! canst thou behold this , and not be smitten to the heart , what wickedness and ignorance lodges in that heart that can utter those things ; though thou think , thou hast done bravely in thus saying , yet the wisdom of God turns thy words upon thy own head into confusion and grievious error , i deny it though thou affirm it , that the devil can take , or knows how to take Christ Jesus and give him to dogs . 

Further thou sayst , i am grieved , that thou shouldst say none but a company of notionist and ranters , &c. are carried with the Quakers , &c. and sayst thou , this appears in all men's sight , &c.  

reply , thou art a liar , i am not grieved at thy flanders and wicked reproaches , but rather rejoices therein , that i am one worthy to bear them , and all men that can see , sees thee a false accuser herein , for such who have feared the Lord , and served him , and are , and have been honest and upright to God and man , have owned us , and have been neither ranters nor such like ; and we rejoice , if any that hath been so , be turned from it unto God , to live in righteousness though thou note it for a false thing in the margin . ( But to make it appear false thou hast corrupted my words ) which are though some of all sorts of persons be brought to God , yet thou * seems to be offended herewith , and these my words are true upon thy head , for i ask not withstanding some were such , are they such who are in wickedness , since they owned us ? then why dost thou wickedly ( As though thou wert offended at it ) upraides us , that such , or such are carried away with us , as though none else which is thy lie uttered in thy hastiness . 

And whereas thou art offended , ( Thou sayst ) that i should say thou art like the Pharisees , whether i spoke so or no , how ever i own that thou art like them ( At least ) even one among them . 

As further i shall manifest , than thou hast over-leapt ( With a false excuse of passing by many railings as thou sayst ) which it seems troubles thee that i should truly * charge thee to bring forth lies without fear , and that the ranters and light notionists , and thee we deny , till you to turn to the Lord by repentance , and if you turn from your iniquity we dare not deny you . 

And further i truly charge thee , that thou art puffed up in thy lies and slanders , and advanceth thyself above the innocent , who exceeds thee in faith towards God , and in good works towards man , and whose conversation is in heaven , but thine is among the hirelings , &c.  and this thou hast skipped over , as a deceitful child , with a poor excuse , which thou May be ashamed to call these railings , but that thy heart is void of shame , let the sober reader judge else , than thou sayst i stumble at that , wherein in thy first thou said the devil persuades these men to believe , 

First , that salvation was not completely wrought out for sinners by the man Christ Jesus , &c.  

reply , here thou art a liar again , i stumble not , for i walk in the light and doth not stumble , but i reproved thy lie , and slander , and said this accusation is clearly false wickedly cast upon us , for there is no salvation in any other , neither is it wrought by any other , but by Jesus Christ , &c.  as page the 9 of my first May be read , but thou hast not at all removed , the true charge against thee , that i charged upon thee , upon these words ( viz. ) a believer of lies , a slanderer , a false accuser , which stands true upon thee still , and will for ever till thou remove it by repentance , for thou canst never clear thyself any other ways , and thou sayst i have left some words out , but this is but a poor catch , for do i not make an et caettera at the end of thy words , and if thou wert not too ignorant , thou Mightest understand that which follows is included and conjoined . 

Then thou goest on , and sayst i am offended that thou should say the devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the light that they brought into the world with them , telling them that will lead into the kingdom &c.  

Now my answer to this is sober , and just * as will appear , though thou say vainly , i seem to be gravelled , because i informed thy mistake , who said pervertingly either in subtlety or for want of wit , the light which they brought into the world with them ; when as the scripture saith , Christ is the light which lighteth every man that comes into the world , joh. 1. 9 which light as i did i do affirm , will lead into the kingdom of peace and rest , and deny it if thou canst , for the light of Christ , doth reveal Christ , and the light lighteth every man that cometh into the world , than thou heaps up many words though thou falsely say , i corrupt that scripture ja. 8. yet i lay it down in its own words , and saith , that is or was the true light , that lights every man that comes into the world , and that light ( Which hath so done ) will lead all that believes into the kingdom , for Christ saith i am the light of the world , and though thou ignorantly would seem to say this is error , yet i affirm it that h• , the same which saith i am the light of the world , is he , and no other , which lighteth every man that comes into the world and this i suppose thou wilt call a filthy error , but the filthiness is in thy own heart and error too , through ignorance of the knowledge of the things of God , who would fain ( If thou could ) make it appear , that that Christ which lighteth every man that comes into the world , John 1. 9 is not the same that saith i am the light of the world , John 8. 12.  Thy confused words seems to carry this meaning , let the reader judge , whether that be not the same Christ Jesus , which John speaks of ; Jobn 1. 9 as it is written of John 8. 12. and though thou ignorantly say i would have room to broach my folly , yet thou lets out of thy vessel insides of leaves , of lies slanders and folly and thou sayst , when he said i am the light of the world , he was without he did not mean any light within , and thou presumptuously bids me deny this if i can , to which i say , the same Christ , which said i am the light of the world , was he which was before Abraham , who was a light to the gentiles , and lighteth every man in the world ; yea , he was and is given to be a light , where his person ( Which was supposed the son of Joseph ) never came , and do thou deny this if thou can that all men May see thy folly , for there is not many Christ's , but one Christ , which is not only within but without , not only without , but within , but is all and in all , let him that reads understand . 

Then thou sayst , the light wherewith Christ , as he is God , lighted every one , is the soul of man , which is the life of the body , and is a creature and hath one faculty of its own nature called conscience . 

reply , now let 's try this doctrine and consider what thou hast said , it amounts to thus much that conscience is of the nature of the soul of man ▪ and the soul is the light of Christ , as God . 

Therefore thou hast said the conscience is the light of God which must needs be without sin , this is more than i have or dare say , i Might here fitly ask thee , if thou know what the word conscience signifies , in true understanding , and yet though thou hast uttered this that conscience is a faculty of the soul , which thou sayst is the light of Christ as God , which light of God must needs be of the nature of God pure and not impure , yet in the next page thou sayst , conscience is a poor dunghill , creature in comparison of the spirit , &c. and in another page calls conscience poor , so empty beggarly things , &c.  

What now John bunion ; is that which thou hast concluded to be the light of God , but a dunghill creature and lo , and empty and beggarly in comparison &c.  for shame cease such divinity , least all thy fellows reprove thee ; oh how doth thy ignorant zeal lead thee into snares and trape thy own feet conscience which thou sayst is the light of God , is nature itself ▪ then it must needs be that every man's nature ( Which is sinful say i ) is the light of God , oh what horrible doctrine this proves in its explanation ! 

Blush , and be ashamed when thou considers ; then thou cries out in reproof ; oh wonderful says thou , that men should make a god and Christ of their consciences ! i know none that doth it , nor that ever spoke so highly of conscience , as thou hast here done , yet we say our consciences bears us witness in the holy ghost , and this is our rejoicing , the testimony of our consciences ; and if our consciences condemn us not , then have we confidence towards God , and yet makes not God and Christ of our conscience , as thou secretly would charge us withal ; then thou goes on and would seem to prove but cannot , that something besides the light of Christ convinceth of sin , but thy reach is too short , though thou wind abroad , and lets thy thoughts into the pit of thy own reason , to bring up a thing to confound truth , but cannot ; for this is thy proof , where they were all convinced by their own consciences jo. 8.  Now all these i say were men come into the world , and therefore according to jo. 1. 9 were lighted with the light of Christ , and thou hast confessed that conscience is the light of Christ as God ; which is no less than i have affirmed , then wherefore hast thou waded so far , when at the end thou art forced to confess my position , thy words being explained , that it is the light of Christ that doth convince of sin , and can find no other thing besides that , than thou sayst , here is something besides the spirit of Christ that doth convince of sin &c.  

But yet i say , nothing besides the light of Christ , as thou hast confessed , and that was that only which i affirmed in the 10 page of mine ▪ about which thou hast made all this stir and to no purpose , ( As to prove any thing convinceth of sin but the light of Christ ) and in that i said he that convinceth of sin against the law leads up into the fulfilling of the law , which still i own , though the world would contradict it but cannot , and i clearly see thou hast not reached the understanding of my words , but answere••hy own conceiving and not my words , for i do not say or think that righteousness comes by the law , yet that is righteousness , which condemneth that which breaks the law , if thou hast an ear thou May hear , and as i said it is the word of truth , the righteousness of the law must needs be fulfilled in judgement , upon you all , and by Christ Jesus in you , if ever you receive the salvation to your souls , and thou hast not yet learned what i mean , and though thou say that for justification , thou looks beyond the law to the son of Mary ; but i say thou must not look beyond it for condemnation ; who are in transgression , and not reconciled to God , through condemnation in the flesh , for it will reach you to condemnation , and thou sayst , thou understands that i do in all my disoourse disowne Christ without , by pretending to a Christ within , to which i say thy understanding deceives thee , who , it May be feared , blinds thy own eyes ; that thy conscience May not condemn thee for slandering , but while i am approved in the sight of God , of those things whereof thou accuses me falsely , and wickedly , i matter nothing what a liars judgement is of me , my answer to thy 6 query shall prove me clear , and thee a liar herein , that we own God's Christ as the scripture deelares of him as i have said , and the darkness of my words is to blind the eye of subtlety , and not to deceive the hearts of the simple , ( Though thou would say it ) see if thou now can tell what i say . 

And whereas thou art offended that i say many more things in thy book i pass by , as being not pertinent to the thing in hand , my words are true , for the thing in hand was proving us decievers , and that was the most of that i meddled withal , or •urposed to oppose ; and to other things that thou speakest of in short , my answer was , and is the words ( Or some of them ) i own , and thy voice i deny without any blaspheming or error , in the view of all the world ( though thou would say it ) for whatsoever a lying spirit speaks , i deny it to be the voice of Christ , though it May be some of his words and thy spirit is a lying i pirt ; & though thou be offended that i should say fools loves to be meddling ; yet its true enough , is not he a fool who is alyer and a slanderer , ••at understands not betwixt before a time , and since a time , judged in thy own conscience , and thy fair words , as that it must needs be ( Sayst thou ) that the saints of God must be called foolos , &c.  I say neved presume the name of saint , but clear thyself of thy lies and slanders , and perverting scriptures , and learn the first principle of religion , even that which condemns thee . 

And as to that which i say is true , that the Pope can speak as much of Christ without as thou , i own it , and May add ; i believe he can speak more than thou of Christ without , and with as good or better understanding ; though both a like star from the kingdom of God ; yet in thy answer , thou asks me if i put no difference betwixt the speaking of ; and believing in Christ without ; yea , i do a great deal for he that believes in in him hath the witness in himself of him , and his heart is purified , and he is a new creature , which thou art not , but thou i suppose would be reckoned a believer , for i think the Pope hath both more words , and more good works and makes as much conscience of lying and false accusing as thou , for aught as May be understood , of a tree by the fruits , which is our way to judge as Christ hath given us example ; then in that i said thou hast answered thyself a question deceitful , thou art offended , and boasts thyself against me , charging me to be an enemy to the truth , and the like , in that i did not manifest thy deceit ; but now i shall , therefore to stop thy proud boasts in that answer thou calls it a sad doctrine which saith , follow the light which Christ hath enligh ned every man withal , and other such like things following that question which are deceitful , and wicked , and thou thereby is proved the enemy to truth thyself , and thou and thy words are both deceitful and therefore boast not thyself : then thou answers my question which was , doth not the scripture witness that all who have not Christ within are reprobates ; the question is sound , and of worth to be noted , and in thy answer thou says , yes it is true , to which i soberly reply , than what a condition are all in , that hath not Christ within , nor no knowledge of him , but what they have of him as he is without , by the letter without do thou consider this ; and whether it be not of the chiefest prize to life and salvation , to wait for him , and seek for him within , seeing all that have not him within are reprobates . 

But farther thou would seem to manifest a great deal of folly in me when all the folly lies in thy own bosom , and by thy confused words , i understand , thou grounds thy answer upon a lie , and false understanding , and therefore brings thy false reproof , as if i should hold forth that every man hath received Christ or the spirit of Christ in him . 

This i have never said , but that every man hath the light of Christ given him which i say is one in union , with the spirit of Christ ; and i say Christ is given to all , but all receives him not and i see thou understands not my former words that i write in answer to one of thy queries thou cannot distinguish betwixt a thing being given of God , & a thing being received by man , so that the folly is fallen back , on thee take it who understands not my words but opposes thy own conceivings and false understanding and though i Might more truly apply this word folly in that extent , than thou applied the like word to thyself in this same page , yet i leave it to the judgement of the serious reader , and says thy folly is want of wit in the world , and not for Christ's sake , than thou would defend thy first wickedness , in that thou said the devil deceives souls by persuading them to follow the light within , which all men have , but my answer to it thou hast not reached , in that i said , he that comes to life eternal must follow the light within which Christ hath given , which stands over thy head for ever to be truth , but yet how blind art thou in confessing the light within , even conscience is the light of Christ as God , and it sayeth the devil deceives souls by bidding follow the light within . 

Oh abominable doctrine ! what doth the devil deceive souls by bidding follow the light of Christ as God ? so John bunnions doctrine is , let it be noted ; now see thou thy folly how it is manifest , and thy pitiful evasions are weighed , instead of contradicting my former sufficient answer , which thou could no way reach to wrest , or otherwise to answer it , asks a question , which i May answer as soon as thou hast sufficiently replied to my former answer and this is in part an answer to it , it is heresy to say that the light of God ( Any light of God or Christ ) can or doth deceive the soul , and though thou stumble at it , i said well in saying that thy whole purpose is a secret smiting against the light within , let the reader judge ▪ 

And now to manifest thy ignorance fuly ; thou hast confessed the light within even conscience is the light of God ; hast not thou cause to repent of these absurdities and blindness who holds forth that the devil deceives souls by the light of God , seeing thou can find no light within man but that which thou confesses . 

Then thou says , thy whole design was first to show souls where salvation is to be had , namely in Christ without , and yet hath confessed all that hath him not within are reprobates , and such have not salvation by him without ; consider therefore without Christ within no salvation , as i have said , and thou hast confessed it , ( Mark it ) then to clear thyself from contradiction which i charged thee with , thou would cast a confusion upon me , in that thou says , i would make a defiled conscience , the law and spirit of Christ to be all one , this is falsely spoken , i have never said nor thought that a defiled conscience is the law and spirit of Christ a liar thou art to be noted , and this lie adds to the number and yet consider thou hast said ( Several times ) that conscience is the light of Christ , as God ; and now calls conscience defiled , is the light of God defiled ? J•hn bunion saith so , oh horrid ! read thou thy confusion and grievious error which is brought to thy door , and there i leave it ; thou May blush and all thy witness at this ; and in that thou calls my answer scolding , against thy epistle , and presumptuously sayst , the truth of which thou could be willing to seal with thy blood . 

reply , scolding i deny , but i have reprooved thy lies in the authority of the Lord , and be not so proudly puffed up in boasting : what says thou ? shall thy blood go for this that the Quakers are deceivers and that the devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the light within which thou sayst is conscience , which thou confesses is the light of God , & that the blood of Christ was shed before the world was , and that the scripture say so , and that we deny that salvation was completely wrought by the man Christ Jesus , with several other things noted for lies ; what says thou John Buniot ? art thou so desperate as that thou wilt hazard thy blood upon this account ? if it be so , sure the devil hath great power over thee ; cease thy boasting least the Lord make thee an example , and though thou would exhort me , thy spirit i deny , and so thy words i judge , and cannot receive good from an evil spirit ; then thou comes on falling on thy own foul ignorance again , and would fain clear thyself , but by thy stirring thy own wickedness herein , thou makes it cast an odious sight to all that pass by , ( We May follow thee a little , seeing thou art not yet weary ) and fain would thou make it appear that the blood of Christ was shed before the world was ; & sayst it was in God's account , but to this i have spoken and largely showed thy blindness to all men , and adds this upon thy head , thou art a liar and perverter of scripture to say that the blood of Christ was shed before the world was . 

And further thou art a liar , to say that God accounts a thing for truth which is a lie , a sad error and wicked . 

And further thou art a liar , to say that i corrupt thy words , for i had not laid open thy nakedness so fully , if thou had not persisted in thy blindness , as now i am forced to do , but enough of this and more than ever thou canst clear thyself of honestly , and yet to cover thy own shame charges me falsely with folly to speak evil of things i know not , or else with madness , &c.  

reply , friend be not so confident , i know the difference betwixt , before , and since , or from , and know that God accounts not a lie for truth ( As thou holds out ) thy own folly and madness , behold , who commits iniquity , in lying on the scripture , and on God , and on me , and yet persists after a sober reproof , and resists the reprover with opprobrious words , let confusion of face cover thy impudent forehead , while i forgive thee and seeks not vengeance against thee , then through thy mistake of my words , thou hast falsely gathered a subject to oppose , and fights with thy own understanding mightily , and thinks thou confounds me , and it 's thyself ▪ for however thou understands my words , either for want of wit , or otherwise , it never entered into my thoughts , with charging thee to believe that Christ is a type , only i charge thee that thou said so of others , so that i think this is a mistake in thee for want of knowledge to understand my rehearsal of thy words , being transcribed at the shortest , not to fill volumes , and through thy own misunderstanding of my laying down the words , thou heavily yet vainly charges me with corrupting thy words , which God is my witness i have not done , though thou be guilty herein . 

But further , i deal plainly , and slanders not in secret , as thou dost , we do not look on Christ to be but a shadow and type , if thou affirm i shall answer further , and as to that ( Thou sayst ) i say Jesus is the substance of that answer to i stand though thou say , thou doubts i do not speak plainly , &c.  

reply , as i have said i seek not a proof of my faith of thee , nor any man , nor do i beg thy belief , while i am approved in the sight of God , herein i matter not what a lying spirit doubts of me , so that what vain arguments , or queries thou raises from thy own false doubt i pass by , being by the present thing branching out in things on the by , if i should examine every particular , i Might fill a volume . 

And whereas thou hast answered my question , which is ; did Christ put an end to the law for them , who yet live in the transgression of the law , or doth he justify that which the law condemns , before the work of the law be finished ? In thy answer thou sayst , Christ did put an end to the law for righteousness , for all that the father hath given him , this is little to the question : 

I say that transgressors of the law are not Christ's but children of disobedience , and children of wrath , and such God hath not given to Christ , who are his enemies , nor Christ to them is not given , but to condemn them in that estate and thou sayst there is many given to Christ , who yet lives in their sins , the apostle John saith , he that sins is of the devil , and hath not known God , and such as are of the devil are not Christ's , and in that i said doth Christ justify that which the law condemns before the work of the law be finished , and not one tittle of the law shall fail , till all be fulfilled , thou hast not reached the understanding of my words , for while disobedience stands & the transgressor lives , the work of the law is not finished nor fulfilled , but to that is condemnation and not justification , if thou hast an ear thou Mayst hear , for he that transgresseth the law is an enemy to Christ , and Christ fulfils not the law for his enemies they must bear their own burden , and though this thou cannot understand now , yet in the day of judgement shalt thou feel it , and when the burden of thy own iniquity is upon thee , then shalt thou confess to what i have said , and read me in what now thou canst not understand , and in the mean time i deny that Christ hath put an end to the law for thee , who art a liar , and breaks one , and so is guilty of all . 

Many of thy words Might be weighed and searched , but i am no picker of quarrels , but to my last query , thou sayst little to the purpose , which is ; what assurance have any , that the law is fulfilled for them , who are yet transgressors of it , in themselves ? but sayst , assurance comes through believing and obedience to the law is a fruit of believing , &c.  saying every one that hath the hope of the son of God purifies himself as he ( Christ ) is pure . 

reply , than he that hath not the fruit , ( viz. ) obedience to the law , we May judge by the fruit , or for want of fruit is no believer ; and he that is not purified as he is pure ( Christ ) hath not the hope of being the son of God , but is without hope , now see where thou art , why it breaks the law , and is without ( Thy own noted ) fruit of believing neither is purified as he is pure , and so is without hope , this is according to thy own affirmation , if thou cannot bear it blame thyself for laying down such a position , as hath proved thyself to be an unbeliever and without hope ; and so without God in the world ; one that is for condemnation , and to be judged into the state where now thou stands . 

And whereas thou sayst , i would lay assurance on obedience to the law . thou liest in this also , my words are , the law must be fulfilled in you by Christ , in judgement and in righteousness , if ever you receive salvation ▪ and these words are true against all thy opposition , neither do i affirm that by the deeds of the law any flesh living shall be justified ( But the contrary ) though thou would falsely ( Yet secretly ) cast it upon me , and wickedly calls this my frothy argument , where i said the law convinceth and is a schoolmaster to bring to Christ , &c.  

But the froth proceeds out of thy mouth , for this argument comprehends thee , and stands out of thy reach for all thy detestable speeches against me , and the truth , and the rest of my following words thou hast passed by , where i say , who owns not that which convinceth of sin , how can they own him that takes it away by his blood ? and this is truth , and tell me in justness according to my first query in that page , how is sin taken away from thee , more than from the Pope , seeing neither of you hath the fruit of ceasing to commit sin , and art not thou in the froth , who opposes me as though ( I should say yet never did nor thought ) that justification must be sought by the deeds of the law and so gathers a false conception , and fights with it , and keeps thyself doing in 9 sheets against 4 and yet hath passed over many special things , almost the chiefest , and though no flesh shall be justified by the deeds of the law , yet must all flesh living be condemned for the transgression of the law by Christ , who freely gives life to all that believes , if thou hast an ear thou May hear ; in the next thou seems ( Or would at least ) to defend thyself from my charge which shall ( If it doth not ) lay heavy upon thee , which is that i call thee slanderer , and truly too , from thy words where thou falsely accused the Quakers with boasting , and hypocrisy , and in thy answer thou sayst , i need not be offended , for thou dost not know our fellow for boasting in that ( Thou sayst ) we cry up ourselves and condemn all others , &c.  

But this is no proof of the former accusation but an addition to thy former wickedness , let honest men consider i asked thee when thou did hear any of them boast or see them live in hypocrisy , but not a word to this sober desire , but adds sin to sin a bad way to clear thyself and thy god ; be ashamed , crying up self , we deny , but yet must say or else say falsely that we are of God and the whole world lies in wickedness , and he that is of God heareth us , and is one with us and this is as the saints testified , and is neither boasting nor hypocrisy , then to my question which was , will that faith which is without works justify , and thou sayst no , & c , 

Then i reply , what is thy condition and theirs , who are not only without works of faith ; but in the very works of darkness , as lying and self accusing , &c.  and seeing thou sayst no , consider , whether thou have faith and whether thy works which are like good works proceed not from the unbeleiving ground , and this i add to my next i asked which thou hast passed by , must not every one receive according to their deeds , in the day of judgement , and then thou runs out in high words against me , in that i said , if to talk of him ( Christ ) his birth , blood , &c.  were faith in him , and living by faith , than few would want it ; and further i add the Pope himself would have it , and my words are just and honest , without exception or contradiction , but only that something thou must needs say ; though thou say many can talk of Christ , that will fall short of heaven , &c.  and asks me a question , and sayst is there not enough in them , ( viz. ) birth blood , &c. to justify , &c.  i answer the knowledge of all things whatsoever without , will not justify , except Christ be within , and if he be within , the power of his life , blood , birth , &c. is known and received and felt , and in this i preach , not any other gospel than the apostles , who said , say not who shall ascend or descend to fetch him , ( Mark ) but it saith it , the word of faith ( Or of the gospel ) which are not divided , is nigh thee in thy mouth , and in thy heart , and thou falsely again charges the Quakers with corrupting , ( and beguiling many ) by those scriptures . 

reply , beguiling is thy own , and corrupting of scriptures too , as is proved , and while thou accuses us falsely in these things , thyself art proved truly guilty , in the sight of all that are spiritual , and as to thy charging me that the man Christ Jesus is not very pleasant to me , and with scolding , &c.  

Thy slanders i bear with patience , and thy reproaches which is not for evil but for Christ's sake , who died at Jerusalem , and is revealed in me , and for shame cease to say thou art ruled by scripture , a liar , and slanderer , and perverter of scriptures , is not led with the spirit that gave forth the scripture but is ruled by the devil , and is out of scripture rule , than thou goes on and would justify thy ignorant saying , how are they deceived who own cbrist ; no otherwise then as he was before the world began , &c.  

And my * answer to it thou hast not touched nor truly contradicted which stands over thee and is sufficient to all honest persons , and Christ we own the same yesterday to day and for ever ; and doth believe the father granted that request , and he is glorified with the same glory that he had before the world was , and though thou tell me of a double meaning yet in plainness i speak without doubleness the fault is in thy weakness , and sottishness , and blindness of heart , who knows not that which is infinite and immortal , and eternal the flesh of Christ's body is so . 

Then thou falsely charges me again ( In that i said ) if every spirit be of God which doth in words confess thus ( viz. ) that Christ was with the father before the world was ( Was born and suffered in the flesh and was buried and raised , &c. ) then is not the Pope himself antichrist , &c.  as ( In my 14. page ) which putting on a veil and venturing upon thy words . 

But i have spoken the truth herein let that in thy conscience answer in nakedness without a veil , the veil is on thy heart , and thou cannot understand me , and so this is thy simple policy to say the veil is on me , and what of that if i ventured on it , it is but in the fear of God , though i should say i deny all that thou sayst , or the speaking of any thing , for i do not own thy voice , though some of thy words be true , and though thou speak words of truth , yet therefore i reprove thee , and sometimes May not let it pass for truth , for Christ is my example herein , who reproved the devils , though they confessed him , ( Mark that ) but the chief part of my words are passed over , and read over again and see if it is not truth it self , where i said it is not much better nor more accepted to confess Christ in words to become , and yet in works to deny him , than it is both in words and works to deny him , the one is wicked in profaneness , the other in hypocrisy , the one is a liar , and the other a false witness , and let the honest judge ; then whereas i said Christ is a mystery and unto him he is light , and shall be salvation where his person , supposed son of Joseph , never came ; which words are true , not gainsaied by thee , though thou ask , did he obtain salvation for any without that body which he took of the virgin . 

answ. that body which was begotten by the holy ghost is not so carnal as thou supposest , and that spiritual rock which followed them saved them , and the same son of God the saviour who was born a child to them , was the Prince of peace , yea , the everlasting father , but thy eye sees not this , and therefore thou sayst , here 's the place where he is not , and the place where he hath not been , ( Now thou sayst ) thou passes by many things which thou Might justly examine , and also many unseemly expressions . 

Oh thou deceitful heart  and tongue , is this thy excuse when my words are beyond thy reach either to understand or contradict ; thou wants that spirit which can examine of truth , be it known unto thee , and what are those unseemly expressions ? wilt thou slander always in secret without evidence ? and if these be they in that i said our innocency will speak when thy black veil of lies is taken away , and this is truth , and is no way but seemly to be spoken to thee , who art an enemy of God ; then thou would justify thy further slander , who said , we wrest that scripture , jo. 1. 9  

And my answer is , we take it without adding or diminishing , which is true and no lie , nor wresting of it , neither in thy reply can i find that thou proves it , though many words uttered little to the purpose with adding to thy former slanders , in saying , we would hold that that light is the spirit of Christ this is not spoken in all my book , but that it is one in union i say , and not contrary to the spirit of Christ , but witnesseth of it and to it . 

And thou further saith , we say many things which thou knowest to be blasphemy , this is another lie , prove one blasphemy . 

And further thou sayst , Christ as he is mediator doth not enlighten every one that comes into the world , &c.  

reply , well , thy ignorance and wickedness vents itself forth a pace , let any man read that first of John , and see whether he doth not speak of Christ as mediator , he saith he was in the beginning with the father , and was made flesh and dwelled with the disciple ; and his life was the light of men , and the light shined in darkness , and what was he which lighteth every man that comes into the world , and he came to his own but they received him not , but as many as received him to them he gave power to be the sons of God , &c.  

What sayst thou , was not this spoken of Christ as mediator , consider & be instructed rather than let thy blood go for it , however i leave thy doctrine , thy errors herein to be judged by them that are spiritual , and for shame cease such doctrine , the more i rake among the filth , the more vilely and odious it appears , and for thy proof of this doctrine , thou brings mat. 11. 25. and says here the father and the son are speaking one to another , but what doth this prone though it be so , doth it any way follow that John did not speak of Christ as mediator , John 1. what vain productions thou brings from thy impertinent proofs , let them be weighed and taken notice of honestly , and thou bids me understand thus much , that nature which is conscience , is the light of God . 

I understand thy blindness ; if this be so as thou sayst , than man's nature is pure without sin , as the light of God is ; and this is error abominable , contrary to the scripture which saith , all by nature are the children of wrath , is all by the light of God ( As thou sayst nature is ) children of wrath ; so thy divinity , and take it as it is truly interpreted , i desire not to wrong thy words , thou gives me to understand the greatest ignorance from those things that lately i have heard , no not the like in England ; and it is very true , as i said thy folly appears by thy much meddling . 

Then thou asks me , what i will have the light called , wherewith every man in the world is lightened , and because i do not call it the spirit of Christ , thou ( As it were ) murmurs ; because i have cut of thy occasion , and thou cannot bend thy tongue with any seeming advantage against the truth ; but in that i say the light of Christ convinceth of sin , which is true , thou on a sudden produces thy bad consequences , and asks if i call nature the light of Christ , and such like , &c.  

But they all do not prove the contrary , so that which convinceth of sin , is worth minding and takeing notice of , by all that ever is saved , and as to that where i say , that which May be known of God was manifest in them even in them that was given up to work unrighteousness , &c.  

I said the truth which thou art not able to contradict in equity , though thou very ignorantly bend thy answer ( As if i had said ) the knowledge of God was made manifest in them , when i say plainly in my book that they were turned from the knowledge of God , and yet that which Might be known of him was manifest in them , and this thou canst not deny , and though my words as laid down are not in the scripture words in terms , yet have not i said falsely herein , and do not be a prover of that which thou cannot thyself deny , than thou sayst , how feeble an argument is this to prove , that every one hath the spirit , &c.  

reply , thou blind man , did i go about to prove any such thing or make any argument thereupon ; we are about the light which Christ hath given or lighted every man in the world withal , which light convinceth of sin , and is not contrary to the spirit of Christ , unto this was i speaking and this i stood by , and thou conceives another thing from my words and fight against thy own consequences like a man too irrational to understand common English , &c.  

Then thou sayst , thou passed by other lame arguments which i tumble over like a blind man in a thicket of bushes . 

Oh be ashamed for ever ! thus to evade and shuffle , with such scornful words ; i said that which reproves of sin is the gift of the spirit of God . John 16. and that which makes manifest sin , is light , and whatsoever is reproved is made manifest by the light ephes. 5. how dare thou call these lame arguments tumbling over ? what impudence is in thy heart , so to say ? when thou art put to confusion , than such excuses thou brings ; well , some May see thy folly ? then to my question which was , whether that light which every man is lighted withal , is sufficient in itself for life and salvation to every one that believes ; if thou say , not wherein is the blame , in God in his light or in the creature , thou sayst , no it is not sufficient , i take it for an answer , and leaves it to be weighed by the sober reader , and though there be vessels of honour and of dishonour made of the same lump as thou sayst , yet i further query , is not every man's blood that perisheth of his own head , and is not the Lord clear from the blood of all men , even though they go to destruction , and if the reader try thy book over he May judge whose arguments are lame . 

Then whereas thou said , Christ as God hath lighted every man that comes into the world , to which i said , then why dost thou say we wrest that scripture John 1. 9 seeing thou thyself hast confessed no less than what thou callest wresting in us , and this is truth let all men consider else ; that when thou confesses Christ as God hath lighted every man in the world , it is no less than what we say , and that scripture say , which is , that Christ is the true light , and that is he which lighteth every man that comes into the world ; and Mayst not thou be ashamed to call this so scornfully a glavering answer , not being able to clear thyself from my just charge , in that herein i charged thee with confusion to oppose us , in that which thyself confesseth to be true consider well of it , and let not thy blood go for the truth of all what thou sayst , for i desire it not . 

Further thou cries out , is this all the wit i have , and wonderful ignorance , because i said it is not good to neglect following the light , but that every one mind the light of Christ Jesus in them ; in answer to thy words which was having said the light which convinceth of sin is the light of Christ as God , which the neglect of , will be sure to damn , as thou sayst , and now let wise men judge of my answer , but thou falls heavily on it ; proving that obedience to the law will not justify , and the like which i do not at all affirm but to that i say , the law having its operation upon the disobedient ; the justifier comes to be seen , which is he that is the end of the law , and the law must by him be obeyed or fulfilled in thee , if ever thou be saved from being damned by it . 

Consider of this , when thou hast a better understanding , for its yet hidden from thee , than when thou hast thus cried out against my just answer , thou tells me what i should have said , alas poor man , thou reaches not what the knowledge of things eternal is , by that wisdom in which thou art , i need no man to teach me , but the Lord . 

Then thou sayst . Jesus Christ hath obeyed the law and justified thee , &c.  

reply , nay hold , repent first and be turned from thy iniquities , and believe in him , and boast not thyself so proudly ; thou art in the transgressions of the law in disobedience to it , a liar , slanderer , and scorner , one that the Prince of the power of the air rules in a child of wrath , and every one shall die for his own iniquity , and the soul that sins shall die , and wrath to every one that doth evil , and the revelation of the judgements of God ; learn what this means , or ask them that are of a better understanding than thyself . 

Then thou seems to mind me of some weakness and cries out , wonderful foolishness , &c.  

Because i said the light of Christ given to every man , jo. 1. 9 as thou confessest , is not contrary to the spirit of Christ , and to the grace of God , but is one in their nature ( Mark ) and a man cannot possibly love one of them and hate another , therefore one they are , in the union leading in the same way , unto the same end , and where doth the spirit of Christ give light , or that grace of God work or lead if not in the conscience ? etc , 

These are my words , now let honest men consider and John bunion be silent , what foolishness or wonderful weakness , is in these words , but is only to the wisdom which is devilish , which despiseth truth ? or what cause was there to blush when i wrote them ? as he impudently saith , who cannot contradict them , nor reprove them , and yet rails upon them : no marvel that thou would pass them , as thou sayst with such a poor shift to evade with a lie that thou hast spoken to it already , when as thou hast not meddled of these things . 

Oh let not thy impudence so sottishly carry thee , for thy shame is seen and laid open , its good ( In thy light ) to pass that which confounds thee , which is past answering , so to save thy credit among thy fellows , the cause to blush is in thyself , and it 's brought to thy door . 

Then thou pleads for the scripture to be the rule in opposition to my question which is not answered , which was , can there be any surer thing for the creature to look to , to walk to life , or to come to God by , than the light of Christ which every man hath given him , &c.  

But thou May for shame cease pleading for scripture rule , being thyself art so far contrary to it , for he that walks in the life of the scripture i have union with him , and the light of Christ is a more surer testimony either to witness justification or condemnation , than any man's words without , whatsoever ; then my other question was whether the Turks Jews , and thee and others do serve sin and lust , because Christ hath not given you light to discover your sins , or because you hate that light , that is given , and much to this thou speakest not pertinent , nor answered in plainness , i leave it to the reader to judge , and to read my answer page 17. of my first , which clears truth from all what thou hast said against it in this particular . 

Now i come to the next thing , where thou foolishly charges me , that my doctrine is not according to truth , but a lie , charigng me to affirm that which the apostle doth deny , 

Because i said the spirit is given to every man , though every man receives it not , and it strives with the wicked though he follow it not , &c.  

My words herein are truth , and no lie , neither contrary to the scripture , and let the reader be judge betwixt us , the apostle saith the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal , and some of these to whom he writes thus ; was wicked , given to incest and idolatry , and other sins , here i prove , it was given to the wicked , and thou confesses the righteous had it , and there is but these two on the face of the earth ; now if thou can find a man that is neither wicked nor righteous than thou hast advantage , than some hath not the manifestation of the spirit , the saints had the comforter the spirit of truth , and he ( The spirit of truth ) convinced or reproved the world of sin ; they that were not saints , but wicked had it reproving them , mark these things ; and let honest men judge while both you , and i am silent , whether thy doctrine which denies that which the scripture affirms , or mine which bears witness to the same thing which scriptures speaks , be to be disowned , let an equal line measure ; the shame , and false doctrine is fallen upon thee , and thou art offended ( That i should say thou brings other vain arguments ) with a vapour saying neither i nor my fellows are able to answer , &c.  

But i say true , the arguments are vain , one is , the devils are convinced but hath not the spirit , or such like , now what is this to the purpose , that thou contends in that wherein nobody strives with thee , nor none affirms against thee , and it is a vain argument to parelell the devil in such a cause , as having the spirit , but thou art so blind , it 's hardly possible to let thee see thy ignorance herein . I May not much strive with thee , only I 'll tell thee of those things , and the sober reader shall judge , to instance a thing impossible to prove things possible , is vain arguments , so that i have herein done thee no wrong . Then thou cries out of my weakness , and that i blaspheme , and of a great deal of ignorance discovered in me , and bids me be silent , and falsely charges me with presumption , and such like , &c.  because i said thus much i leave with thee , till thou prove the light of Christ , ( Which thou confesseth every man hath ) to be contrary to the spirit of Christ , i shall say every man hath that which is one in union and like the spirit of Christ , even as good as the spirit of Christ according to its measure , these are my words , page 18. and i own them , and thy answer to them is no contradiction , nor just confutation of them , but liest in saying i call conscience and nature itself the spirit of Christ , this is false never spoken by me , so that thou hast uttered a pack of railing words without any knowledge or fear of God , in stead of a sober answer , the blasphemy and great deal of ignorance and presumption appears not in my words , they are truth , and thou hast not proved that the light of Christ is contrary to the spirit of Christ , nay , thy simple policy is too short , when thou had done so , then had been a time to have cast these opprobrious speeches at me , like venom from a viper , but the weakness ( Or strength of error ) and blasphemy and the great deal of ignorance and presumption etc , is fallen at thy door and there i leave it , clear thyself from it as thou art able , who without any confutation of the words , falls impudently to charge me thus highly and falsely from the words , be thou silent whise the reader judges ; then thou goes about to defend thy first wickedness in that thou said the devil doth deceive poor souls by bidding them listen within ; and turn the mind within , and see if there be not that which doth convince of sin , &c.  

And my answer to this is sound , and stands over thee , and unreproved by thee , though many words thou speakest , yet from the scripture doth not prove or by honest arguments , that the devil doth deceive any , by bidding them to turn to the light within , which convinceth of sin , if thou would have cleared thyself , thou should have proved thy assertion , according to my desire i asked thee , was ever such a thing spoken that the devil can deceive any by the light of Christ , but to this not a word in proof , but faith , every man hath not the spirit of Christ , &c.  

But further than i query , doth the devil deceive any by bidding them to turn in , and listen to that light spoken of John 1. 9 for that light am i contending for , and not any other contrary to it , than thou sayst ▪ thou denies that Paul bid listen within , telling me of making shelter for my error , &c.  This is no error to say that Paul bids listen within , let the reader judge from that scripture , rom. 10. 9  The righteousness of faith speaks on this wise , vers. 6 ( Which is the voice of the gospel ) and vers. 9 what saith it , the word is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart , was not that the end of these words to listen within ? the word is in the heart , what saith it there ? now the error is thine , that denies the truth , and the lie is returned to the founder , who denies that Paul bids listen within , when its plain he saith the word is in the heart , what saith it there ? 

Oh that a man professing knowledge and enterprizing such things , should be so sottish ! and so unable to finish what he hath begun than thou cries out-hidiously and notes it in the margin for wresting of thy words , in that i said , thou sayst , they are ignorant of the gospel who closes in with these motions of the light within ( Or conscience ) which doth command to abstain from the evil , and to practise good , and thy own words are , now the poor soul through ignorance of the gospel closes in with these motions of its own conscience ( viz. ) the motions which convinceth of sin within , which doth command to abstain from this evil , and practise this good , so let wise men consider whether i have wronged that intent of thy words , and be not so soon angry , for thou canst not vindicate , that they that closes in with these motions of the conscience or the light of Christ within , which convinceth of sin within , which doth command to abstain from this evil , and to practise this good , is ignorance of the gospel and do not evade it by words without knowledge , in picking of quarrels and seeking offences ( By different terms of words ) where no occasion justly is given thee . Then my question thou seemest to answer , which was , what , and how doth the light of the gospel work , if not in the conscience , and to command from evil , and to practise good ? this query stands over thy head not consuted nor fully answered , for the true understanding of it thou hast not comprehended , but to thy own conception , thou hast answered as if i should say that every man hath the light of the gospel working in them to salvation which i never said nor thought , so thy answer is not to the purpose . 

Then thou hast passed by full slightly ( As disable to clear thy god and his spirit , that guides thee , which is the god of this world ) of that great sum of wickedness justly charged upon thee , page 19 of my last , which according to true collection is ; by turning the mind within to the light which doth convince of sin , and listening thereunto and clasping in with the motions of the conscience , which doth command to abstain from evil , and to practise good , and closing with something within which thou confessed is the light of Christ , these things preceding , than thou sayst , hereby or thus , is the poor souls carried headlong , and at the end of its life doth fall into the belly of hell , this is indeed a sum of wickedness set forth by thee , which when thou receives it in again shall receive the interest upon it , of indignation and vengeance , and though thou hast slipped it now , it shall then be reckoned on Jobn bunions score . Remember thou owest to prove this before thou be heard any more . 

Then again thou cries out , that i have naughtily belied thee , and the like , because of misplacing a word , and saying the light of the world , instead of the light brought into the world , thou art an unjust judge who makes offenders for a word misplacing , but it is plain , thou means by light brought into the world , that light John 1. 9 which every man in the world is lightened withal , and if thou do than thou art a liar in saying in thy first book and in this , the devil counterfeits the new birth , by persuading it is wrought by that light , and if thou mean not that light , John 1. 9 but that of the spirit , John 16. ( Which i say is not divided ) than thou art a liar also , and now while thou charges me to be guided by Satan , and to be a liar , in the very time hast answered thyself in a lie and cannot get out , mark it . 

Then thou sayst , thou passes by many urging expressions , which thou Might charge with unrighteousness &c.  

reply , i asked thee by what is the new birth wrought , and how , if not by following the light of Christ in the conscience is there any other way to God but Christ Jesus , who hath lighted every man that comes into the world , this is part of that thou hast passed by , with thy lying excuse of raging expressions of which thou May be ashamed to equivocate thus poorly to save thy own credit , the charge of unrighteousness justly falls upon thy own head . 

Thou further saith , and eats up thy own wickedness who said then , and saith it now but most ignorantly , that Satan makes the soul believe is it will but be led by what shall be made known to it , from the light ( or conscience ) within it shall do well , &c.  

My last answer to this , is sufficient , only i ask thee a proof out of the scripture for this doctrine , that the devil do deceive any by the light of Christ , in the conscience within , and till then mind my words , in my last answer , if ever thou know God , it must be by following , and by being led with the light within , which God hath made known unto thee , else that light is thy condemnation eternally . 

Then again thou chargest me with corrupting thy words for writing thee , for their ▪ now a scorner i charged thee to be , from thy words , and that i yet say of thee , taking thy words in thy own sense , as page 77. of thy first doth manifest thee , unto the single eye , and thou secretly charges us , with following our own spirit , and speaking by our own spirit , but our own spirit we have denied , and have received the spirit of the father through the light of Christ ; whereby every man in the world is lighted to life , or to condemnation , than thou seems to be highly offended that i should say , thou dost not profit persons at all , noting it for false in the margin , but thou needs not be so angry , though thou say the persons in the country where thou dwells will testify the contrary , &c.  

To which i say thou hast no cause to boast of the fruit of thy ministry , nor they of much profit received by thee , witness a meeting in Bedford , where a company of thy chiefest members , i suppose , uttered much wickedness in lies and slanders as many can witness , and witness three of thy brethren , testators of this book , who say they know that to be truth , which thou hast declared , and thou art proved a liar in many things , let them read themselves false witnesses and liars like thyself , and these things being considered as i said with other things at the end of this , thou hast no cause to boast of thy ministry , nor they of their profit , by it in that country , who art unconverted yet , from lying and false accusing , and so art not turned from Satan's power to the power of God , and as for a carnal ministry of which thou speaks , they are very bad that exceeds thyself in carnality , in thy understanding of the things that are spiritual , then further thou goes on seeming to bring witness of thy former slanders , having in thy last , falsely accused us with sad blasphemies and horrible doctrines and thou sayst , my speech bewrayeth me , that i am one of them , because sayst thou , i say that every man hath the spirit of Christ . 

Oh thou lying tongue when wilt thou cease thy wickedness ! I never said nor thought so . 

And further thou sayst , i say there is that in every man which is as good as the spirit of Christ , my words are the light of Christ , lighteth or is given to every man that comes into the world , which light is not contrary to the spirit of Christ , but one in the union and as good in its nature according to its measure , and till thou prove that that light John 1. 9 is contrary to the spirit , which yet thou hast not done , stop thy mouth and take shame to thyself , for being foully guilty thyself of corrupting my words , which thou falsely charges on me . 

Other things thou sayst , that our society should affirm , but i May have ground to judge thou art , so slanderous a tongue on me , that the like thou May do of others . 

And whereas i said thou art , confounded in thy discourse i said true herein , as instance , thou sayst , that conscience May be seared and evil , and another place that conscience is the light of God , can the light of God be seared , or is it evil ? thou holds it forth . 

Consider , is not this confusion , other things i Might collect , but this one is sufficient to prove thee in confusion and though thou reckon us some time with the ranters , and sometime with the Pharisees , with many words of bitterness and envy yet we bear thy reproaches , and when they are taken off then shall we appear , and thou appear and be judged , as we are , by him that is above all . Then thou falsely charges me with corrupting that scripture , in John 3. 19  Whereas , i neither added nor diminshed but spoke it as is to be seen in my book . Further charging me that i do not understand a difference between tbe light of the law , and the light of the gospel , &c.  

Friend , i rejoice in that i am hidden from thee , and that my words are a stumbling to thee , for in that state thou standest the entrance into the kingdom of God , thou shalt not know whose wisdom is foolishness with God , and though thou say the light of Christ is a saving comforting light , so will it be to thee a condemning light , and of all liars and slanderers , and this shalt thou know though thou art busied up and down , in thy mind seeking occasions against me , from my words , not clearing thyself from what i have truly charged upon thee , but accusing me falsely , and this is come to pass , that thy shame Might openly appear , as to that difference of the law , and gospel ; thy wisdom with my knowledge of it , i shall not seed , yet i leave the reader to consider , deut. 30. from vers. 11. to 16.  And rom. 10. 7 , 8.  And what i said yet remains upon thee undone to prove by the scripture , something to convince of sin without , and besides or contrary to the spirit of God , which thou art never able to do , for though thou say ( As none affirms ) the light in every man's conscience is not the spirit of God , yet how dost thou prove ; or when that it is contrary to the spirit of God , which in my last i put upon thee , and now i leave it with thee , and then thou would excuse thy first words , in that thou called the Quakers found hypocrites , but hast not yet proved that they live in hypocrisy , and so art a liar still , and my words are just upon thee , a perverter of the right way of God thou art , and in the day of judgement it shall be proved by thy recompense . Then thou goes about to prove that a natural man May have power over sin , and abstain from those things forbidden in the law , and for thy proof thou instances in Paul , who said he was blameless , phil. 3.  Now this was before the commandment came from God to him , which let him see the law was spiritual , and this doth not prove that he had power over sin , for he was in envy , and so a murderer , and had not power over sin , according as i asked thee , if thou sayst he had power over sin , &c.  

As thou seems to do before he was convicted , while he was a natural man , than it was no sin to persecute Jesus , and this would be blasphemy , the product of thy doctrine , but this thou hast cunningly slipped , where i asked thee to get power over sin , and to abstain from those things forbidden in the law , is it not further than thou ever came ? and because thou wilt not answer , i do and say yet , and concludes , that John Bunians state is not so good as Paul's , while he was a persecuter according to his own doctrine , and thou sayst the gentiles did by nature the things contained in the law ; true , but their state was not condemned , but justified , before the circumcision , and i ask thee , is any condemned by the Lord , who are excused in his sight , or is any justified who is accused , and my words are sound , which thou ignorantly comments upon where i said i rather chose to be of that profession which abstaynes from those things forbidden in the law , and to have power over sin then to live in the transgression of the law , and under the power of sin ; yet talking of belief in the son of Mary , &c.  let the reader judge whether of these religions is more accepted in the sight of God , thy religion is proved to be talking of belief , in the son of Mary and art in the transgression of the law , a liar a false witness in envy and backbiting and such like , thy false belief will not save thee in the day of the Lord . 

Then further thou still confesses that as he is God , Christ lighteth every man that comes into the world , then , wherefore dost thou make all this ado , in opposing us , in this particular , yet let 's try thy doctrine , whether it be sound , thou sayst , this light wherewith Christ as God hath lighted every man , is conscience ; and yet sometime saith this conscience is seared and hardened and evil ; what is the light of Christ as God , seared , hardened , and evil ? j. Bunian holds it forth ; this is thy great ignorance and blasphemy , and sometime thou sayst this light is nature , and nature is corrupted and sinful . And in it , all are children of wrath , what is the light of Christ as God corrupted and sinful , and is all by it children of wrath ? John Bunians doctrine holds it forth ; though blindness possessed thee , when thou write this , yet Mayst thou blush at the reading hereof . 

Then thou goes to give a meaning upon my words ; in that i said the law is light , and light is the law , which is truth , but i spoke them not for thee to interpret with thy lying spirit , but let spiritual men judge of them then much ado thou makes in answering my question to thee , but hits not my words at all : i asked thee and bid thee show if thou canst any sin which is not against the law but this thou canst not do , though you would prove if thou could , that unbelief is not a sin against the law of God ; then thou speaks of the obedience of the son of Mary imputed to us , &c.  but i say the obedience of him without doth not justify any ; who are in the nature of enmity against him , who is not a new creature nor condemned in the flesh ; and whereas thou secretly charges us , with mingling law and gospel together ; i tell the we know the operation of each , and doth witness the ministration of each , and they are not divided nor opposite one against the other ; but that one is the fulfilling of the other , and though thou said you leap over the law , for justification , yet it is too high for the to leap over for condemnation . Remember this , and all thy feigned faith while in that nature thou stands uncondemned , is but as the stubble for the fire ; then whereas i charged thee with preaching another gospel , than the apostle preached , & my charge is true upon thy head , and my proof is sound , against thee , he directed to the word within , in the heart rom. 10. what saith it , the word is in the heart , and he turned to the light from darkness ; but thou saith who shall ascend to fetch him , men must follow him to the cross without , and to heaven without , &c.  and so art one that saith lo here and lo there ; but these things thou hast passed by , with thy lying excuse of quarrelling , a many poor shifts thou art fain to make , and in that i said thou was a liar , in saying the light ( viz. ) of Christ as God , doth not show the soul a saviour or deliverer , my charge upon the is true and stands unremoved , and i asked thee , if the light of Christ doth not show Christ to all that walk in the light , then what can but this ; thou hast passed also most deceitfully which stands upon thee to answer or to stop thy mouth , than thou would excuse thy contradictions charged upon thee , in that thou said they are wickedly deluded , who own Christ no otherwise then as he was before the world ▪ and yet saying God only is the saviour and there is none besides him , and all thou sayst clears not thyself from contradiction herein , let honest men be judge betwixt us both , for thou judges falsely me to be naught , and i am sure thou art naught , and thou will not take my judgement , i May not take thine , ( Let impartiality judge betwixt us ) than thou would excuse thy slanders charged justly upon thee , in saying that Quakers make light of the resurrection , and to prove thy wickedness , thou asks us whither it be so , it's time enough for us to answer when thou hast brought evidence of the first accusation , what poor proof is this for to cover thyself , though to add to thy wickedness . Thou say , thou knows we deny it , i ask thee when it was , or where it was , oh thou enemy of righteousness , yea thou shalt arise in the day of judgement to shame and contempt , and this i affirm except thou repent of this thy wickedness ; 

Then whereas thou urges me , that i should have answered , the query raised from eph. 4. 10 , better , or confuted thine , &c.  do not boast but hear what i say , thou sayst in that answer , that Christ ascended to the right hand of the father in your nature . Mark now , thy nature and your nature who are one with thee , is sinful and wicked and of the devil for so all liars are , and it is blasphemy to say sinful wicked divillish nature , such as John Bunians is , and his fellows , is at the right hand of God in heaven , oh horrible ! consider of this , and see what thy begging an answer hath brought upon thee , i deny though thou affirm it , that thy and your nature which is wicked ▪ or , a man in that nature is ascended into heaven , and therefore boast not thyself another time , this nakedness of thine Might have been covered but for thy own boasting , and thou sayst acts 1. proves it , let the reader search , if he can find that Christ ascended in sinful wicked nature , such as theirs is , who are one with John Bunian , and this is another lie of the scripture , and though thou with much impudent confidence affirm the Quakers to be deluders &c.  i say from that we rather love dispraise then praise , and are as our fore fathers were Counted deceivers and yet are true , and thou art deceived in thy own heart , in that thou understands my words , that i should say as though there were no false prophets now , because i said they were in the apostles days , which is true , and yet are they now too ; even it 's witnessed by thee , and thy fellows , who are in their steps , who through coveteousness making merchandise of souls , and your persons are ever learning , and not able to come to the knowledge of the truth , and goes for gifts and rewards , and are false accusers and such like . Nay but understand me better , for i say thou art a false prophet , and thou art now , though thy root sprang forth in the time of the apostles of which thou art a branch , and thy fellows ; and though i said that Antichrist was in the days of John , and this was before a Quaker was heard of , my words i own , prove that , that the Christians was called Quakers at that day if thou canst , &c.  i allow not thee to be my interpreter , except i found thee more honest , but doth condemn thy meaning upon my words , and though thou say instead of proving ourselves not false prophets , we prove ourselves no Christians , because i said ( That word ) Quakers was not heard of in those days . Now consider , are they no Christians now , whose title or name without , was not given or heard of , in the apostles days , than Protestant's are no Christians , nor independents are no Christians , nor Anabaptists are no Christians , because they were not called so in the apostles days , and while thou hast thought to prove us no Christians , hast cast out thyself also , than thou art no better than we , and what poor arguments these are , let the wise consider , and vain consequences , i did not say there were no Quakers then , but not a Quaker beard of ( viz ) by that name ; for there was thousands of Quakers , who trembled and quaked at the word of the Lord , Moses , and David , Jeremiah , Isaac , Paul with many more were Quakers , and tremble•ss , though not then so called , but as i said , such as thou hast such thou brings , and thy Master will accept thee . 

Then thou sayst , i fling dirt in thy face , because i said if we should diligent search thee , we should find thee in their steps , through feigned words through covetousness , making merchandise of souls , loving the ways of unrighteousness . And further i said among them thou art found , who art preaching for hire , and loves the error of Balaam who went after gifts and rewards , &c.  now thou seems to be grieved , and calls this a false accusation , but let 's try ; the cause admits dispute , art not thou in their steps , and among them that do these things ? ask John Burton with whom thou art j•yned close ; to vindicate him and calls him brother , he hath so much yearly , 150. l. or more ( Except thou hast some of it , ) which is unrighteous wages , and bire , and gifts , and rewards . What sayst thou , art thou not in his steps , and among and with him and them that do these things ? if he be thy brother , and thou so own him , what is evil in him whom thou vindicates , i lay upon thee , but tell me , who have heard thee deny him , and the rest of the independents , in these things which thou knows he doth act , and in thy answer i cannot find the fully clearing thyself by denial , but sayst that spirit that lead me out of this way is a lying spirit , out of what way i say , out of the way of preaching for hire , dost thou mean ; nay it 's a lying spirit in thee , that go in their steps , and among them that goes in this way , and though thou bid me have a care of receiving by hearsay , what i have ( Said ) received in this , is truth , though thou evade it never so much . 

As to that of some bidding thee throw away the scriptures , &c.  indeed upon such terms , it Might be spoken so as to be owned , a liar and a slanderer is an unfit fellow to meddle with the scriptures , or to take the name of the Lord , or of the man Christ Jesus , in his mouth , and i May say truly what haste thou ( Unrighteous person ) to do , to take his name , and truth in thy mouth , hateing to be reform . 

And in that i say of thy crying against Christ within , this is true who said there was nothing in thee , nor any man ( Without acception ) to be taken notice of , as we May prove by witness though thou deny it ; then , was not Christ within , and what less is this , then to cry against him , when as thou denied him within , or else concluded he is not worth taking notice of . And though thou say i falsely speak of thee in saying thou calls the doctrine of Christ within , false opinions , and take in hand to discover it , but the falseness is in thee , who hath uttered that which is untruth , and contrary to the gospel , and now denies it , or would hide thy wickedness ; for thou having framed an objection , and speaks of some that are for a Christ within , &c. and then thou sayst , thou will discover the falsity of such opinions , now thou dost here reckon the doctrine of Christ within false opinion , ( Or among them at least ) let the reader judge , and be thou silent for shame ; but all thou sayst clears thee not , from what i said of thee , God shall judge thee thou lying tongue , and deceitful heart . 

Then thou charges me with folly and to eat my first words , and to be unstable in judgement , and to fight against the truth , &c.  from my question asked , doth not the scripture say , Christ is within , except you be reprobates , and is not this thus much , all is reprobates but they in whom Christ is within , and yet because i said the measure or manifestation of the spirit , is given , to every man , this thou hast catched . at , and would prove it unsound , but truth is over thee , and both these are true ; and further , i say that Christ is given into the world , yea to all , but all receives him not , and they that do not receive him are reprobates , though he be given but not received , and the folly and fighting against truth is in thyself , who saith it is contrary to the scriptures to say the spirit is giving to every one , thou here liest of the scripture as it 's proved and i do not befool myself in saying the words ( Or some of them ) i own in thy book , though i have written against the book , for though thou speak Christ words and the apostles words , yet thy voice is the strangers and thy voice i deny , what ever words thou speaks , and is not befooling myself , and here i could justly end my discourse , and what is said is sufficient , to manifest thee and me , to the honest reader . And thus far thy weapons of slanders are broken , and thy refuge of lies are layd-wast , and this also is cast by , as our spoilt prey of Babylon's treasure , and trampled upon , and know that we are of God , and he that is of God heareth us ; and to our God , shall all bow ; and before him tremble . 

And whereas thou seems to be greatly offended , and stumbling very much , at my answers to thy queries , because thy carnal conceptions is not satisfied , nor thy vain mind gratified , having as thou thinkst great occasion against me thereby , which causes thy mouth to be opened in vapouring words aloft . against the simplicity of the gospel , not understanding my words , for the things of the kingdom of God is a parable to thee and sealed from thee , never to be known in the reason in which thou judgest . 

But in short thus i reply , i did not purpose to answer fully to them to feed any man's wisdom with my knowledge of the things of God's kingdom ; for the queries were not fully directed to the Quakers ; so that quench thy anger , and according to my answer , go seek a further answer , ( Or else be thou still unsatisfied ) from them who are led with a spirit of delusion , for such a direction requires no full answer from me , nor any of us who are in the truth and not in the delusion , neither did i purpose nor do i at any time to answer fully to such things are directed in a great part to others , i am not a servant especially to them that are led with a spirit of delusion , to fulfil thy will , but yet the short answers that i gave , ( Which was not in the behalf of delusion ) but for the truth's sake , i still own though thou cannot understand them , but products many bad lying wicked consequences from them , and my purpose was not to feed thy foolish wisdom in answering ; nor to satisfy thy reason to receive praise from thee or any man for so i know it must be in hearing and seeing , thou must not perceive nor understand , who art of the generation hardened and in parable is the kingdom of heaven unto thee , and i rejoice the rather in being a stumbling to thee , in that state wherein thou standest , then that i should have gratified thee , for i seek not nor receives honour from man in what i do ; but is covered from the world's knowledge , and know this , if thou cannot receive the kingdom of heaven as a little leaven ; thou shalt never know it ; but yet how wicked art thou in this also , though not understanding me , in what i said yet , so foully wronging me with above 30. false charges and slanders from my words , which thou reaches not the knowledge of , so it will be enough . 

reply , to sum up thy lies and send them backe to thee to seek them out , and an evidence for them and the queries and my answers shall stand as they are to be judged of by honest men , while we are both silent in our own cause , they are to be seen at large in my first book , the true faith of the gospel contended for , &c. in the 26 , 27 , 28. pages . 

And whereas further i speak at the end of my answers of Christ within the hope of glory and said , it is that mystery which long hath been hide from ages , but now is made manifest and declared , and though the wise of this world cannot receive it , but speaks evil against it , yet it is dear unto us , and so much more precious because despised by such as him and such things are a testimony to us and against you , ( viz. ) our enemies , &c.  as in my 29.  Page of my first May be seen ; and most wickedly this , or part of it , he calls babblings , and says he passes by it . 

Oh horrible impudence ! what marvel that he should so belie me , when as he hath called the very scripture truth , spoken forth in righteousness , babblings ? and these things i leave the reader to judge of , and all his lies thrown upon me impudently and consider , what ground this man hath from my answers to be seen in my first book to broach out and belch out such a number of lies and slanders , in 5. sides of paper , not any one of them ( Charged against me falsely ) were spoken by me , or ever in my thought to speak , or ground given by any of my words for such productions , as it is seen what lodges in the heart of such a fellow even desperate wickedness who is without any shame or honesty , who dare utter such things against the upright , who hates not his enemies , but while i am clear in the sight of God , from all his false slanders , i matter not what John bunion say of me , who is as a man given up to wickedness who in less than a sheet of paper hath uttered 30. lies or more , which i May particularly manifest before he can find evidence ; a great wickedness ? can this man's converts be good , while himself is unconverted ? is he a minister of Christ ? for shame let it not be told so ; well i beg not vengeance against him , but leaves my answers to be read , who will clear me from his lying consequences , most wickedly conceived , and as wickedly uttered ( by one of god's army ) against a member of Jesus . 

Now i come to reckon up his damnable doctrines , and errors , which are contrary to the truth ; as will manifestly appear , to him that is spiritual ; some of them damnable without comparison . 

John Bunian said , that Christ's second coming , is not his coming in spirit , for his coming in spirit is no coming . he saith , this ( Or part of it ) is a lie made of him by me ; when as several witnesses , doth testify in righteousness , that those very words were spoken by him , in Paul's steeplehouse in Bedford town , May 23. 1656. as is witnessed , and yet this man is so impudent , that he denies what he spoke , ( Or is ashamed of his words ) and so would cast the lie upon me , who is clear , and the wickedness lies at his door , and whereas he would prove that the second coming of Christ , is not his coming in spirit , i say i will not beg him to believe it , but as he believes , so be it unto him , and all that he saith doth not prove , but that Christ promised , and fullfilled to his disciple , that he would come again to them , ( Mark ) again is a second time , if any man hath an ear let him hear . And then he saith he will not trouble himself to lay this to my charge in that it was said of him ; Christ's coming in spirit is no coming , it May be he repents of what he hath said , being better considered , since he hath already falsely charged me with it , as some in the county of Bedford knows very well , that he hath falsely charged me and denied his own words , spoken by his own mouth . 

Also he said , take notice that i affirm that there is nothing in me nor in any man to he taken notice of , these are his own words spoken by him April 12. 1656. at Patnam , witnessed by three men , who heard it from his mouth , and this charge he doth not fully deny , but in a great measure he assents to it , yet would cover his shame a little with a lie , in saying , directly in this form of words he did not lay them down , but this will not serve to hide his reprobate state , for to his face it may be testified he spoke the words , as i have laid them down , and therefore consider against whom i am yoked , against one that is a reprobate , and without Christ in him , one that have denied Christ in him , or else thinks Christ not worth taking notice of . Oh abominable ignorance , why should such a fellow take the things of God in his mouth , who hath denied Christ in him , and the spirit of Christ indeed it appears that he doth take notice of nothing in him , else he would have been wounded with the light in his own conscience , before he had brought forth thus many lies , it seems he takes notice of nothing in him , but is past feeling , damnable doctrine indeed , without comparison , that ever one professing a minister of Christ , should be so stark blind and wicked , yea , we have taken notice of what thou hast said and it shall be recorded for ignorance of the greatest sort , but he would evade the thing and give a sense upon his words , and in such a sense he owns , and in such a sense he denies it , but what is this to the purpose , except he confess it , ( As it is ) that he is unregenerate , and if so , he confesses the light of God is in him and then to be taken notice of , if it be but to condemn him . 

Oh blindness to be marked ! well , this man's folly hath appeared sufficiently , who confesses this light in every man is the light of Christ as Gód , and yet saith , he affirms there is nothing in him , nor any man , ( Regenerate or unregenerate ) without exception ) his words here spoken , worth the taking notice of . 

The rest of the particulars charged upon his fellows is passed by with the excuse of wanting the names expressed , May be he is glad to be ignorant in this thing , but let 's search , John Burion said , that Christ had two bodies , one our of the sight of the saints , in Bedford , May 23. 1656.  And to this John Bunian confesses but would excuse it if he could , and would manifest that Christ hath two bodies , clean contrary to the scripture which affirms ephes. 4. 4.  Now no marvel that he gainsays me , when as he hath gain said the apostle , who saith expressly , there is one body , but they say two bodies ; let them be ashamed for ever , thus to contradict scripture , 

John spencly , ( One of the testators of this lying scroll , a member of the same supposed church ) said that Christ and the word of life were two things , and so would divide Christ contrary to the 6th . of John 48. where Christ saith he is the bread of life , and contrary to 1 John 1. 2.  The 23. of the 8. month , 1656. . John bunion and one fer. and j. child laid down . 

1.  That God died , and that very God , and the everlasting father died contrary to many scriptures , as dan. 4. 34.  dan. 12. 7.  

2.  They affirmed , that the word that was in the beginning was crucified upon the cross , contrary to the 1 Peter 1. 23.  

3.  They affirmed , that justification is without obedience , but yet say i , none is justified in disobedience but all condemned in it , let them mark that , and there is but either in obedience , or in disobedience , and he that is a believer and justified , is not without obedience . 

4.  That there is a light which convinceth of sin , besides the light of Christ , and John Bunian in all his book cannot prove any is convinced of sin , that hath not the light of Christ or that any thing besides the light of Christ doth convince of sin , so that his confusion doth appear , 

5 , that there is no saving knowledge but what comes without from heaven , contrary to 2 cor. 4. 6 , 7. where it is said the light shone in their hearts out of darkness , j. child denied that the man Christ Jesus had given a light to every man that comes into the world , contrary to joh. 1. 9  

Also he denied , that every man was lighted , that they Might believe , contrary to jo. 12. 36. 35.  jo. Burton said , that a man Might be upon the foundation and yet deny Christ , now the scripture saith , matth. 10. 33.  He that denies Christ shall be denied of the father , and the father denies not any that are on the foundotion as they affirm . 

Another of them said , that the word that was hide in David's heart was the outward scriptures . 

Another of them affirmed , that he was justified from all his sins , past , present and to come and said there was scripture in the acts to prove it . 

John Burton said , that a man is not justified by the spirit , John Bunian said , the 30. of the 11. month , that the spirit of Christ doth nothing ( Mark ) within man as to justification , he affirmed , that the flesh of Christ is not within any man , than there is no man that hath life in him if Christ's words be true , jo. 6. 53. and Christ's words is true , and therefore jo.  Bnnions doctrine is , he said , that by the kingdom of heaven , within the Pharisees Luke ▪ 17.  Christ speaks of himself there as a personal man to be that kingdom of heaven , mark here what the substance of this is , doth he mean that the person of Christ was in the Pharisees . 

Oh horrid blindness ! not to be parrelelled . 

He said , the best thing in a natural man is impure , and yet in this book confesses that the light of God is in all men , so that must be impure , else j. Bunians doctrine is a lie ; but the light of God is pure , and therefore jo.  Bunians doctrine is a lie , 

He said , that the scripture , in every place doth not mean as it speaks , and instanced that in Peter , not to mean as it speaks , where it is said , yea , as lively stones are built up a spiritual house , and where it is said , have salt in yourselves , he asked if a man's belly must be filled with salt , mark this expositor , and his blindness and ignorance , and the cause why he is silent , and forbears to aggravate sin is , least hard thoughts should be entertained against him , let men judge , whether this be not an unfaithful man to the Lord , who rather then harsh thoughts should be against him in the wicked , he will be silent , and hide and cover sin in sinners . Oh wickedness indeed ! 

He saith , that Christ ascended into heaven in our nature , ( viz. ) in his nature , and they that are one with him , and he and they are proved to be in corrupt nature , as they will confess it . Oh what wickedness to hold forth that Christ is at the right hand of God in sinful nature , as his words holds forth from his own mouth . 

jo. Burton said , that men May depend too much upon something called Christ , and the righteousness of Christ within . 

He saith , that the devil knows how to take the children's bread ( viz. ) Christ Jesus who only is the children's bread ) and give him to dogs . Oh sad error and damnable . 

He saith , that the devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the light which they brought into the world with them . 

And he confesses that light is the light of Christ ( As God ) oh unutterable ignorance ! can a sober man read this , and not be ashamed , to hold forth that the devil deceives souls by bidding them follow the light of Christ ( As God ) ? 

He saith , they that follow Christ aright , must follow him without , to the cross without for justification , or mount Calvery without ; they must seek for justification without , and the spirit of Christ it leads to Christ without . 

Reader , see if this be not near unto Poperey , or inquire else what he means , as if he would have persons to go a pilgrimage , and this is contrary to rom. 10. 6 , 7 , 8.  

He saith , that the soul of man is the light wherewith every man is lighted by Christ as God , and this is the light that every man brought into the world with him , and the devil deceives souls by this light ( viz. ) by the soul , this is true from his own words , let it be marked by sober men , what damnable doctrines these are , hardly fit to be raked in . 

He saith further , that the devil deceives souls by persuading them to follow the light within , which he confesses is the light of Christ , and that all men hath it . 

He saith , conscience is the light of God , and yet in another place saith , conscience is defiled , what concurrence is here , let the reader judge , to hold forth that the light of God is defiled , his words plainly shows , to say that the law is the schoolmaster to bring to Christ . 

He saith , this is a frothy argument . 

And to make up his wickedness he saith , he is ruled by scripture , consider whether those doctrines and lies be not quite contrary to scripture , what impudence is in this man's heart to say he is ruled by scripture , he saith , they that look upon * Christ no otherways then as he was before the world was , he dare to be bold to say they are no Christians but Antichristian , he saith , that * Christ as he is Mediater , so he doth not lighten every man that comes into the world though as he is God , he doth , markhere , he would divide Christ , not to be the same , the son , as he is the father ; yet he confesses in his book , what the father doth , the son doth also , see what contradiction here is ? not worth the raking in , oh blindness that May be felt in the grossest darkness he inhabits . He saith , that the devil hath more experience of the knowledge of the eternal power , and godhead , then unregenerate men ; mark , the word more signifies something . He saith , the light of Christ as God , is conscience and nature itself , mark , nature is sinful , and wicked , and all are children of wrath , in it so are all by the light of Christ as God ; wicked & children of wrath if jo.  Bunions doctrine be true , let him make it good as he can : oh wonderful trash & muddy stuff , unheard of before . He saith , the devil deceives souls , by bidding them listen within , and see if there be not that which doth convince of sin , mark his doctrine well . He denies , that Paul bids listen within , contrary to that scripture , rom. 10. 8 , 9  He saith , conscience May be hardened and seared , and is naturally evil , and yet saith , conscience is the light of Christ as God , see what an agreement is here , the light of Christ as God , is hardened and seared , and evil , else j. bunion must revoke his doctrine , or else prove this , consider what stuff this is , which is held forth by him . 

He saith , he preaches not for hire , indeed , he had no need to receive money for such doctrine as these . 

He saith Christ is some four or five foot long , this is more than he can tell . 

He reckons the doctrine of Christ within a false , ( Or among false ) opinions . 

He saith , it is contrary to scripture to say the measure ( Or manifestation ) of the spirit is given to every man , though Paul saith so plainly to the Corinthians , 1 cor. 12. 7.  

Mark here he hath spoken quite contrary to scripture , denied that which Paul affirmed or else Counted Paul's words against scripture . 

He saith , they that are born of God do daily sin , absolute contrary to the 1 John 3. 9  And therefore he would give the apostle the lie . 

Now reader consider , whether thou wilt believe John Bunian , or the apostle John , for they are at odds , and speaks quite contrary one to the other . 

He saith , that the light that shows thee there is a God , and that this God is eternal , would lead to life , then Might the devils be delivered from damnation , and the devils knows God as a creator , &c.  

He saith , that the light spoken of John the 3•is the man Christ Jesus , and yet saith , that the man Christ Jesus , is not a condemning light . 

Mark that scripture , saith that light was condemnation to them that did evil , he saith not , who must you believe . 

He saith , that the liar and slanderer is an unbeliever , and his condition is sad . 

Consider here , how out of his own mouth he is condemned , who is at large proved a liar and slanderer , out of his own mouth will the Lord condemn him . 

He saith , that a man cannot give a more right description of a false prophet , than the prophets , Christ , and the apostles did give . reply , in this thou hast truly said . Now let 's consider , how thou hast ▪ confessed to thy own shame , and laid open thy own nakedness , the prophets said such was false prophets as preached for hire , and divined for money , and fed themselves , and clothed themselves with the wool , and that used their tongues , and said the Lord saith it , when God had not spoken to them , and that cried peace to the wicked , and Christ said such were deceivers , who had the chiefest place in the assembly , and stood praying in the synagogues , and loved the uppermost rooms at feasts , and that were called of men Master , and such like , and the apostle said such were deceivers , to take gifts and rewards , and lucre , and that loved unrighteous wages , and that were backbiters , and false accusers , and covetous , and having a form of godliness , but denying the power , who ever taught , and the persons were not able to come to the knowledge of the truth , with many other such like . Now this is my appeal to all men's consciences , in the sight of God , whether thou art not found under some of these carrectars' ( At least ) or whether thou art not one in union and fellowship , with such who act these things , yea , thou art ▪ among them and not crying against them , and so art guilty of their sin , though not as fully in the act as are some , May be ; so that i doubt not , but they who have not hardened their hearts , and blinded their eyes will see , how thou hast condemned thyself in confessing the truth , and the time is coming that further it will be made manifest concerning thee , only at present thou art sufficiently discovered , to be out of the truth in the way of perdition , and how ever though thou hast covered thyself , as much as is possible ▪ from the stroke of thy own hand , and from the guilt of thy own confession , yet jo. Burton , thou hast condemned an hundred , i think of independent ministers , ( So called ) thy brethren , who are known to be found guilty of those things , all or most of them , which thou confesses are marks of a false prophet , and while thou bids us examine ourselves , thou art the man ( Or among them ) that are proved truly guilty . 

He saith , he is not come to one of the days of the thousand years , of Satan's being chained , and this is truly confessed , and so he is in the reign and government of the devil , and Satan is not bound but at liberty in him , ( As it well appears ) and Christ's reign is not known , and so it must needs be true , that he is of the army of the dragon against the lamb . 

Some of the same members with him said , in Bedford , that they scorned that light which convinceth of sin , ( Which the Quakers speaks of ) 

Further , most falsely i am charged by him with railing against the Lord Jesus , which is absolute false ; my words are spoken in fear and reverence of the Lord Jesus . Reader , these things i leave to thee , to be judged of , his false slanders and his damnable doctrines , and wicked lying accusations ; and contradictions which his 9 sheets of paper is filled with , as if he had set himself to lie , and slander and speak wickedly against the truth which is over him , and is a testimony against him , and though opposed by him , yet not confounded , but him it confounds , and by it he shall be judged and condemned ; and the time comes when further he May be made manifest , if this be not sufficient ▪ out of the abundance of his heart , hath his wicked tongue tered these things , which are but a little of what lodges in him , but let him prove these things first , and then utter more . 

And now John Bunian , thou and thy false witnesses ▪ and all thy company and brethren in iniquity , remember and repent for the day of your visitation is upon you , blessed were you , if you could receive it , before it be spent , not to be recalled ; and before the long suffering of God come to an end and you be shut up in utter darkness , and indeed friends the day hastens wherein every man shall receive according to his deeds ; he that hath done evil shall not be cloaked , and he that hath done good shall not be uncovered , in that day when the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open , and searched with the eternal eye ; the end of my work is to clear the truth , and the way thereof , ( God is witness ) from thy slanderous and lying and perverting tongue , and only i reprove thee , by the spirit of the Lord , and so leaves thee to receive thy reward from the just God of righteous judgement ; who upon thy head will render vengeance in flames of fire , in his dreadful day , which upon thee comes suddenly , even when thou and you cries peace , peace , then shall destruction come as an armed man from which thou shalt not fly to escape , though now you all be hardened against the Lord and his way and truth , and hath even bent thy tongue for lies , and hath reproached the innocent , to the piercing of thy own soul , and one day shalt thou know it , therefore bow and tremble before the Lord God , thou and all thy companions , a liar and slanderer thou art , a perverter and wrester of the right way of God , and of the scriptures , a hypocrite and dissembler , a holder forth of damnable doctrines an envious man , and false accuser , condemning another falsely in what thyself is fully guilty of ; these things i lay to thy charge justly in the presence of the Lord God , and upon thy account are they reckoned by him , and proved by testimony in the sight of man ( And May be more fully hereafter if any thing be wanting ) and one day shalt thou feel the burden of them , though now thou be above shame ; and all thy lies , slanders , deceits , confusions , hypocrisies , contradictions , and damnable doctrines of devils , with impudence held forth by thee , shall be consumed in the pit of vengeance , and then shall the witness in thy conscience justify the Lord ( In condemning thee ) & me , to be true in reproving thee , and this i say to thee , and you all , the living god you know not , nor his son Jesus Christ ; but are enemies to God and * persecutors of the Lord of life , and shall perish among the uncircumcised , ye false witnesses , and wicked helpers ; you May be ashamed of your testimony subscribed at the beginning of his lying scribble , will you yet say through grace , those things are true ; the father stop your mouths in the dust , who hath offended the Lord , more than defended him , or yourselves ; and be ashamed in the presence of God and man , much more May be said hereafter , to lay you further open , if you yet harden your hearts in your wickedness , but i do rather reprove you , then strive with you , and rather desires your return to God , than your condemnation by him , and with this i shall end , and by what is said in short is sufficient to manifest you , and John Bunian to all honest persons , what generation you are of , and that you are guided by a lying and unclean spirit , and that you are doing the devil's work in gainsaying the way of truth and righteousness , by your multitude of lies and slanders , and damnable doctrines , and whatever you account or falsely judge of me , yet am i true ( Though as a deceiver ) and the Lord's servants , and a witness for him and against all your lies and slanders , and wickedness hatched amongst you and brought forth by a lying orator whom you have made your mouth into the view of the world , even a cursed birth , and the father of it ; and the womb that conceived it , and it shall rot , and perish as the dung and not accomplish any part of the end , of your desire , for so loathsome it is , being truly searched and laid open that it hath not obtained neither the praise of God nor man , but is defamed by men , and condemned of God ; alas , alas , for thee John Bunian thy several months travel in grief and pain , is a fruitless birth , and perishes as an untimely fig , and its praise is blotted out among men , and it 's passed away as smoak ; truth , is a top of thee , and outreaches thee , and thy form weapons cannot prosper , and it shall stand for ever to confound thee , and all its enemies ; and though thou wilt not subject thy mind to serve it willingly , yet a slave to it must thou be and what thou dost in thy wickedness against it , the end thereof brings forth the glory of it , and thy own confounding and shame ; and now be wise and learned , and put of thy armour , for thou Mayst understand the more thou strives , the more thou art entangled , and the higher thou arises in envy , the deeper is thy fall into confusion and the more thy arguments are , the more increased is thy folly , let experience teach thee , and thy own wickedness correct thee , and thus , i leave thee , and if thou wilt not own the light of Christ in thy own conscience , now to reprove thee and convince thee , yet in the day of judgement thou shalt own it , and it shall witness the justness of the judgements of the Lord , when for thy iniquities he pleads with thee , and behold as a thief in the night , when thou art not awarre , he will come , and then woe unto thee that art polluted ,
