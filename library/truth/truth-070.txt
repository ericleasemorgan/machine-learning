TO THE READER . 

READER , 

IN the first part of this Book thou mayest behold the Universal Love of God , with the Work of his Power , and thou mayest also behold how man comes to be regenerated , and washed , by the Everlasting Truth , and what the state of man is in the Truth , and what the state of man is out of the Truth ; and thou mayest see how Life is attained through Death , and how Rest and Peace in Christ Jesus comes to be possessed . In the middle part thou mayest behold a Testimony unto the Truth , and Enmity and Deceit in opposition to the Truth . In the latter part thou mayest behold diverse Cases stated , by which thou mayest perceive something of the Law , and the practice in it , and how deeply innocent people suffer for want of Right : And these things thou reading over , and diligently observing , it may overcome thee , to choose the better part ; and in so doing , thou wilt be kept out of all crooked and perverse ways , and not run with those that are wicked , nor join hands with cruel men . And as for the middle part of this Book coming to view , it is through a necessity upon me to do good , and that Warning may be taken by all who in such cases are concerned : for I do not publish that part , because I would lay open the faults of any , neither to boast or glory over the weakness of any ; for I have received the Love of God , and with that I can cover a multitude of Offences ; though in the same Love a Necessity is upon me , to make such Practices manifest , that whosoever is found in them , may speedily repent and turn from them ; and that such as are yet free from them , may be preserved out of them , that so all may come to find mercy with the Lord And now let thy mind be to the Good in thyself , and with the Light of Christ Jesus read this Book thorough , and learn of the meek Spirit of God , for in that there is no envy ; so will it teach thee Truth , and lead thee into all Truth , where thou wilt feel the Everlasting Springs , and the pure Streams of cleansing ; and as thou waitest in the Spirit , thou wilt feel the Effects of it to be Love , and the Virtue of its nature , Gentleness and Peace ; and if thou mindst it , to obey it , thou mayest do well , in which my labour will be answered , who desire's the well-being of all men .

THE Standing Truth , etc.  

Love is of God , and by the Light of Christ Jesus , the Love of God is shed abroad in the hearts of all that believe ; for the Light is a manifestation that beameth forth from the Love , and in the Light the Love is tendered , it is an universal Principle , that in its own purity discovereth the world in man's heart ; for the viniversality of its manifestation is not enclosed within the compass of any bounds , but unto all men it giveth light , and makes manifest with its light , what is present in every man ; and in this manifestation the darkness cannot limit it , for it is manifest in the universal love of God , to give light to all that are in darkness , that all in it might believe , and come to everlasting Life . Now here is the love of God first to man , which love being received , as in the Light it is manifested , than man comes to be drawn with the love of God , to love God again , and this is perfect love , with which love the sinner is sought , and for sin reproved , wherein the Lord God doth make known his own compassion to a sinner , and doth manifest , That he would not the death of a sinner , but hath given his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting Life . And with this light of Christ Jesus , is every man enlightened that cometh into the world , and by it , there is an universal manifestation of the love of God ; and though the Lord God doth thus manifest his love unto man , and hath given to every man a measure of the Light of Christ , with which he is enlightened , and with which he sees his sin , yet man not obeying the Testimony of it , he abideth still in darkness , and so he errs from the way of Truth and Life , and is a wanderer in desert places , and takes up his abode in the dark corners of the earth , and there sits estranged from God , and alienated from his Life , and there man suffers bondage and affliction in himself , his pain and his sorrow is daily upon him , and his anguish and his grief is continually about him ; for no man can have true peace in his own house until he come to the Light of Christ , with which he is enlightened ; and after he is turned unto the Light , and come into obedience , than he hath a war to make , and a great battle to fight , before he can come to feel his peace settled and sealed ; for with the Light , the body of sin , and the body of death is discovered , and then m‚óèn comes to see how many enemies doth compass him about , and how by them he is separated from God , than he comes to see what he must war against , and what armour he must put on to stand in the battle , and what weapon he must take to make way thorough his enemies ; and by believing in the Light and following the Light , he receives strength against his foes , and having received the Light , he hath received the Love of God , and then he stands clad with the whole armour of God , and takes the sword of God , with which he smiteth to the heart of his enemies , and wounds them to death , so sees his enemies fall before him , and when they are fallen he casts them out , and cleanseth his house , and then Christ Jesus takes the possession , and he brings everlasting peace in with him ; and this is a wise man , whose eye looks to his own house , and takes care of his own family ; such a man love's peace at home , and delights to see his family in order , and he is a Christian and not an Infidel ; for all Infidels are unfaithful to the Light , and so neglect their own houses , and take no care for their own family , and their house is out of order , and their family is not provided for , and there is no peace in that house ; for , when man's eye opens into the world , he let's his enemies into his house , and they sit and rejoice over him ; there the lust of the Eye goeth forth , and the pride of Life exalteth and ruleth , and in that part , all envy , and malice , and evil-will is begotten and nourished , and there the seed of the evil-doet hath his authority , and from his power proceeds all unrighteousness , all the bad thoughts , words , and deeds ; it is the very Womb of cruelty , and the Breast that nourisheth the persecuting Birth ; and whilst this is entertained , that peace of the house is disturbed , and all the family is out of order , and such a man is worse than an Infidel , who takes not care of his own family , but le 's in enemies and entertains them , and so harbours that which disquieteth his family , and destroys it ; and then his own house being filled with enemies , and they sitting in authority over him , he becomes actually disposed by them , and in their nature he appears against others , and so envy , and malice , and evil-will , and cruelty , and persecution is brought forth , and from the strength of darkness within , it comes to be executed upon the innocent without , and this is the wicked state , unto which there is no peace ; but the righteous rejoice in God , and in his Love their peace is sealed : Now the Light being loved , the house comes to be cleansed , and all the old rubbish of envy and malice purged out ; for the Power comes to have an operation in all that believe , and by its working it kills the lust of the eye , and cuts down the pride of Life , and slays the perverse Nature in every part , and roots out the man of Sin , and brings down the Throne of Antichrist , and so the Seed of God riseth , and the water of cleansing is felt , and the little leaven is known , that worketh all into a new lump , so that the heart and mind becomes clean , and the inward parts are washed , and here Christ is known in his power , and his fan is felt to go in man , and the fire is felt that burns the chaff , and for this end is Christ made manifest ; and thus doth he come to man in the fall , his judgement is with him , yea it goes before him , to cut down the seed of the evildoer : but they who abide the day of his coming , or who stand before him when he thus appeareth , who love his refining hand , and turn not their back upon him , or who abide the furnace , until the work be perfected by him . O his appearance is dreadful whilst the wicked standeth , but his mercy is sweet when the wicked is removed . And thus to be regenerated , is a work beyond man 's own reason , and thus to be renewed and changed is a state not to be comprehended : and who comes to the putting off their old things , they are ready to receive new , and so passes from death to life in the translation , and then they are born again of incorruptible Seed , in which Seed the Gospel is known , and Gospel-peace possessed ; and there is Christ in his power over all , he rules in the family , and all the house is in good order , and plentifully provided for ; and he fills that house with his peace , and all the family have fullness of joy in his presence ; Here a man is in Christ , and is a Christian , and then he is no more his own , but in the Life he is disposed , and all his fruits appear for God ; Love is become his Garment , and Meekness the Girdle of his Loins ; and this is the Birth born of God , and to do his will it doth delight ; to love enemies is its nature , and it can feed them when they hunger , and give them drink when they thirst ; it cannot revile when it is reviled , it cannot seek revenge when it is persecuted , for it is born of Love , and in love is naturally disposed ; and this is the man that is after God , who is regenerated by the power of God , and is born of the Seed of God , which Seed is holy , pure , and perfect , which Seed is Christ , the Wisdom and Righteousness of God ; and as he is in himself , so he is made the same to all that are born of him ; then man with his virtues becomes clothed , and is holy as he is holy , in which holiness God is seen , and in this pure holy life of Christ , the pure Religion is known , a Religion undefiled , ( mark ) Christ undefiled , the Religion undefiled , and that Religion that is not so , is none of his , for the pure Religion standeth in him , and all his fresh springs open in it ; the heavenly water of Life is felt , and known , and his Streams run and cease not ; the Lord God doth open his Fountain , the strength of his love goes forth , the River cleanseth the Valleys , and the sweetness of its virtue is felt from sea to sea , the strength of it is very great , and the banks with its fullness is ready to break ; this Religion flourisheth in the Life , and in the Life it stands firm for ever , and of its heavenly virtue there is no end . And here is the standing Truth , in which Truth Christ is fed upon , and the meat that endures to everlasting life is known ; This is the Bread that comes down from heaven , which if a man eat he shall never die ; and except man eat of this , he hath no Life in Christ ; and in this all changeable things have their end , he puts that part down , out of which the many Religions arise ; and so they decay and wax old , but he endures the same for ever , and brings in a standing Religion in his own nature , and in this Religion there is no strife , nor envy , nor persecution , ( for that is Cain's mark ) but love , and peace , and good will to all men , the love that overcomes Cain's nature , and razes out his mark , and proclaims Peace on earth , and Goodwill amongst men : Here is Christ manifested in the Father's Love , and he would not the death of a sinner , this is his mind ; and a sinner is conttary to his pure Nature , in which there is no sin . then they have not the Mind of Christ that will Kill and Persecute about Religion , and Oppress those that are contrary minded ; that is the work of Antichrist where ever it is , and such are not redeemed out of the World , but life's in it , and with that part slays the Lamb , and crucifies the holy One , and that is spiritual Sodom and Egypt , where the Just suffers ; for man not being redeemed , hath a part standing that doth not regard the Innocency , but rules over it , and there man is wise in his own eyes , and with that part he is lifted up , and under that part doth the Innocent suffer , and that is the part which defiles a man , and tosses his mind with the waves of its sea ; for man can never come to true settlement , whilst that part liveth in him , that would be wise in knowledge out of the Life ; and whilst man is there seeking to know , and to be satisfied with knowledge , that very part comes over him with a vail , and blinds his mind from that which he is seeking to know ; and this part will wrist things according to its own apprehension , and from its own apprehension will draw conclusions , and that doth thicken the vail upon man's heart , but never removes it ; and man being thus situate in his own Wisdom and Reason , and with that part comprehending , he stands at the greatest distance from that through which the things of God are revealed , and his mind is not simple to receive the simple Truth , but in the subtle wisdom of the flesh , and the reason in that part , he is striving to comprehend ; and here many seek but find not , ask but receive not , they are amiss in themselves , and would receive things into that part which God doth never answer ; and many lie here unsatisfied , and many also that satisfy themselves with that which they have comprehended , into which their belief is entered , though from God that part was never answered , and so they build their nests on high , and in their wisdom sit puffed up , and there the fowls of the air please themselves with notions , with which the just are oppressed . O how many entertain their enemy in their house , how do they harbour him , and lodge him , and every way seek to please him , as the most worthy guest ; but the best friend may stand and knock , and not a door open to let him in ! O that people did but consider their present states , how is man filled with that which the enemy brings home , and how doth he receive it as the most lovely thing , if the old wisdom doth but hunt , and the old reason bring it home , with what joy is that entertained , and how choicely is that treasured up , and what pride and glory doth man take in such riches , it needs not be answered in words , for he that with the Light of Christ will search his own house , may find it to be so , and receive an answer from the Witness of God in his own Conscience ? and therefore it is high time for all people , of all sorts and sects , to awake , for time is swift , and being passed , none can make it their own again . O search with that of God in you , that which bears the burden of uncleanness , and of all your own righteousness . O down into the deeps , where you never yet have been , that you may come to clearness in the bottom , and learn the wonders of the Lord in that place ; and if you love the Light , you may see your guests , and how with strangers every room of your house is filled , and how the Son of Peace and Love is excluded and shut out , he is too low for your Wisdom , and too mean for your Reason , and when he would come in by his Light , and beget your love unto him , your eye cannot behold any comeliness in him , and so you exclude him as not worthy of acceptation ; and he being thus rejected , that is holy , and meek , and just , and good , what can your houses be filled withal but passion , and deceit , and envy , and malice , yea rottenness and hypocrisy is lodged in your rooms , and with such guests your houses are filled ; and there is an unclean house , and an unclean heart and mind , which God's besom of judgement must pass thorough , before the Son of Peace come into that house to govern : So in the universal Love of God , here is the Truth laid down , as it is in Jesus , that all who seek after the Lord God , may be informed into the right way , and let them mind well , what here briefly followeth . 

The Light comes from God , and shines in darkness , and with the Light darkness is discovered ; for the Light is not of darkness , though it shines in darkness ; but with its manifestation it showeth and reproveth darkness with its deeds , and that is the first Principle of the pure Religion , and the first Step into the way of Peace : for to obey the Light , is to obey Christ the Power of God ; and through obedience , when the Light reproveth , the Power is felt to take away that which is reproved ; and Judgement is executed upon that Nature which hath transgressed ; for the Power being minded , it begets man into a selfdenial , and leads him in the daily cross , to all that which it doth reprove in him ; and then the Power crucifies that part down which hath disquieted , and troubled man in himself , and through the Power , man comes to his Peace ; for the way of the Cross is the way of Peace , and the Cross is the Power of God , and the Power stands in the way which leads unto Life ; and self must bow and be humbled unto it , and the Cross must be daily taken up to that part which would save its Life , and there must not be a turning aside to fly the Cross ; for that which draweth to do so , is darkness and not Light , and there is a part in man , that is very hardly brought to the Cross ; and if it be brought unto it , it is a very hard thing to keep it there ; the Life is sweet , and would save itself , and so the darkness standeth to wrist aside from the Cross , and that which wresteth from the Cross , doth wrist the Scriptures also , unto which it draws the mind , and raises up a defence for its Liberty : here darkness wresteth , and then catcheth and enshareth , and the old Wisdom and Reason doth here betray the Innocency , and such never come clearly thorough , though they may have seen some opening ; for the Cross being denied , and the judgement fled , man never comes to be changed , but abides in the old nature , and what he hath seen afar off , he gathers it into the old part , and with that unrighteous part , he holds the Truth ; and that is the part which loveth not the Cross ; but to die is the greatest gain : Who have ears to hear , let them hear . When a man can stand still , and eye the Power , and the work of the Power in himself , than he sees from whence his Salvation cometh ; and than Christ is known in his Power , and received in his Power , and there is no reasoning against him ; which Power is the Cross to every part of the old nature , and humbles it down to the death , and crucifies the world unto man , and man unto the world ; and there he loses his own Life , with all his Wealth , and all his old garments are stripped from him , and the willing and running ceaseth in him ; and all his own Wisdom and Reason comes into silence ; and there he lies before the Power a naked Child , and in that state waits for an entrance into a new Life , which through the Cross is attained ; and there is the passing from Death to Life , and Christ Jesus is then known , and Life in him , and so an innocent birth is born of the Seed of God , and man rises in Christ , and becomes an heir of Life and blessing , and then he knows the Kingdom and the Inheritance , and there he possesses the Peace and the Joy ; and then the Seed manifests its perfect beauty , in its own perfect righteousness , and perfect holiness , and the glory of it spreads abroad ; and this is a state which can never be compassed , nor attained , but as in itself it is revealed ; for the strongest Reason of man is below it , and the deepest of his Wisdom cannot fathom it , nor compass it ; neither is there any other way to possess it , but through death to all that part which would compass it and comprehend it ; therefore every man to become a fool , that he may be wise ; and if People would but come to such a state , they might behold the son in his beauty , and the glory of his incomprehensible Life and Wisdom , which many are come to witness to his praise for evermore . And all that would be answered with Peace , must come to the simple state ; for the subtle searcher createth grief and trouble ; and therefore every man and woman to deny themselves , and receive Christ Jesus , in the despised way of the Cross , that he may baptise them into his death , and raise them again in his own Life , and then his Life , and Power , and Wisdom spreads abroad , and his kingdom over all is set , and there is rest from labour , and sitting down in perfect peace : The Inheritance known in the Kingdom , the Possession known in the riches of it , than man knows his portion in God , who is the Fountain of everlasting good . I thank the , OH Father , Lord of Heaven and Earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent of the world , and hust revealed them unto babes : even so Father , because thy good pleasure is such . 

A Narrative of some unjust and cruel dealings , etc.  

I Having received the Truth of God , and coming to walk in obedience to it , and to live it , I came to be convinced by it , of the unlawfulness of many things , that in times past I had practised , and observed ; and amongst diverse other things , I was convinced in my Conscience of the unlawfulness of Tithes ‚ñ™ and being so convinced , I duly considered them in the ground , because I would not keep back any thing from another , that might be his right : And waiting in that which did convince me of the unlawfulness of them , it was manifested to my understanding , that the ground of them under the Gospel , was wholly out of the truth ; and besides , if any man had a due in such a part of my estate , as was under the Law , when such a part was due to certain People , and for certain uses , yet I found that the same use was not made of that part now , neither were they such a People that now in diverse places did receive them ; for under the Law they were paid into the Storehouse , and the Levites had one part , and the Fatherless , and the Stranger , and the Widows they were relieved with another part ; so that the Storehouse did supply the necessity of many , and there was not an Impropriator known in that day ; to have his own private Barn to gather his Tithes into , and dispose of them to his own private use . But besides this great disproportion , betwixt Tithes under the Law , and the use of them then , and Tithes at this day , and the use of them now ; I also was convinced ; that Christ Jesus was come to be the end of the Law , and the end of that Priesthood ; and the Priesthood being changed , there is of necessity a change of the Law ; and that by Christ Jesus , Life and Immortality was brought to light through the Gospel ; and that a free dispensation was now to be enjoyed , and lived in : And still waiting to understand these things perfectly , I came to know my own freedom , by the power of Truth , in my own heart , and the Truth set me free from that state where I had been in bondage , and so I was gathered by the Light of Christ Jesus manifest in my Conscience , into the love of God , where he opened his Fountain , and I tasted the freeness of his grace , and of his Mercy ; and in this dispensation , the Son of God was revealed in me , and then I knew the Law , to be fulfilled by him , and all the Types and Figures , and Shadows , and variable Things to pass away , and come to their end ; then was my Understanding perfectly informed , concerning the particular case of Tithes , and I was clear in my Understanding , that no Commandment stood in force for the continuing of them ; but by Christ Jesus , the Law and the Commandment , was fulfilled , and that no man had any right , either to give or sell to another any part of that increase which the Lord increased unto me ; and was truly the fruit of my own labour and charge : And upon this ground , I could not for Conscience-sake towards God , observe that Practice or Custom of Tithes any longer , though before I had done it with great diligence , yet now I could not set out any part of that to another , which I was satisfied was my own ; but I did mind to gather my corn , as it came into order , without taking notice of any man And William Pocklington of North Collingham , was at that time the Farmer by Lease , from the Impropriator , of that part called Tithes , within that place where I had corn growing ; but this is to be noted , how that he had assigned the interest of his Lease , unto Anthony Pocklington his Brother , as the said Anthony told me himself , and as there was sufficient cause to believe it ; for the said Anthony was in Possession , and did gather the Tithes for his own use ; by which it did evidently appear , that the present Possession , after the manner of the Law , did lie in Anthony and not in William : Yet notwithstanding the said William caused a Sheriffs Warrant to be brought against me , and sued me in his own Name : and one John Taylor came into my dwelling house , and did arrest my Body at William Pocklington's suit , and I desired to see the Warrant , and he showed it unto me , and I found the day of appearance to be past , according to the Warrant ; and when I told the said Tailor of it , he left me and went his way : then the said William , procured another Sheriffs Warrant against me , and one John White came to my house and did arrest my Body , and he gave me time until the next morning , to come to his house at Newark , and when I came there , I found William Pocklington , who would have been drawing of me to Composition , and said he would put it to me , if I would but give him any thing ; but I could not consent to give him any thing upon that account , whereupon he caused me to be sent to Nottingham Prison , and it being mentioned in the Warrant that the Gaoler was to keep me safe , so as the Sheriff might have my Body , in one of the Courts at Westminster , such a day before Oliver Cromwel's Judges , to answer the said William in a Plea of Trespass : I was desirous to have gone , and given him an answer , but without an Attorney nothing would be accepted , though there is not any Law to compel a man to use an Attorney in such a case , but in his own Person he is to appear ; which thing I was very willing to have done , but I was kept close Prisoner , until the day of appearance , and also at the day , and after the day , and was not suffered to have any liberty at all , but was kept among the Felons in the Dungeon , and so continued a Prisoner about twenty one weeks , and then I was sent for to London by a Warrant from a Committee of Parliament , and I appeared before them , by whom my liberty at that time was obtained , and I was set free from my Imprisonment . And a little time after I had much weakness upon my Body , and I was so weak that I had not been forth of my Bed for about three weeks , neither could I stand upon my Feet ; and in that very time , and in that exercise , the said William Pocklington procured another Sheriffs Warrant against me , and one John Musson came to my house , and by making a lie , he got into the room where I lodged , and did arrest my Body in bed , at William Pocklington's suit , and presently after him came John Taylor , and he asked me what I would do ? I told them , they had my Body , they might to what they were permitted ; unto which Tailor replied , that Mr. Pocklington saith , If you cannot ride , he will hire a Cart to carry you to Nottingham : So I was willing to give them Bond to appear , desiring to have come at that time to a Trial with him , and for that end I procured two Friends to be bound with me for my appearance : Thomas Elsam of Gerton was one , and Robert Cranil of North Collingham was the other ; and after the Bond was sealed and finished , the said Musson did arrest Thomas Elsam in the chamber , at the said William Pocklington's Suit also ; and he not being willing to answer their practice , he hailed him away : and the same day another Friend was arrested , called William Thorpe of Gerton , at William Pocklington's Suit also , and they were both sent to Prison ; though such persons as were concerned to take the Tithes in that place , had taken Corn and Hay from them , both in the Meadow and the Fields : but the said William Pocklington released the said William Thorp within a little time , and continued Thomas Elsam many weeks , and then released him also . So , according to my Bond , I went up to London , and was there at the day of Appearance , and did appear in my own person before the Judge , in the same Court as was expressed in the Warrant and in the Bond , and I had an Attorney of the same Court with me , who was an eye-witness of my Appearance ; which being done , I gave him order to enter it in the Office , according to their practice , and he told me he did so : but the said William did not proceed any further against me at that time , but caused Robert Carnil , who was one of my Bonds-men , to be arrested at the Suit of the Sheriff , upon forfeiture of the Bond , though the Bond was wholly discharged by my Appearance , as before is mentioned ; yet notwithstanding the said Robert Carnil was sent to Nottingham Prison , and there did remain a Prisoner about twelve weeks ; about which time I released his body by a Supercedas : then he let all his Suits fall , and caused my Corn to be taken in harvest-time ; and those that he employed , took away my Corn in their own wills , and this they have done for two year's last passed ; yet notwithstanding he hath caused another Warrant to be brought against me , which was served upon me the seventh day of the eighth month 1662. , I being in the Prison at Nottingham to visit Friends that were in bonds , the Under-goaler brought me the Warrant , and showed it me , and said it was at Pocklington's Suit , by which I am now detained a Prisoner ; and the said Pocklington meeting the Under-goaler about two days after , he bid him tell his Master , that he should not let me have any liberty , ( as the Under-goaler told me ) for if he did , he would complain to the Sheriff : by which practice his spirit is made manifest to all reasonable men , and every moderate eye may see that he is not clothed with Christianity , which is to love enemies , but hath a Heathens nature , and the mark of the Beast in his forehead ; and his envy doth appear to be exceeding great , who cannot appease it in so many years together , but still presses forward to the filling up of his measure , which is very near at hand ; and though I have patience in the love of God to bear these things , and have from time to time overcome the evil with good , yet I am free to open , wherein , and in what places I might or may take just advantage according to the Law , so far as I am free to use it , both in relation to himself , and some others by him employed in that business , whose proceedings have been illegal and unjust , as in these particulars following may be clearly seen . 

1.  The suing of me in his own name , when the Interest was in another , as before is mentioned , and in that Case being falsely imprisoned by him about twenty one weeks . 

2.  To sue me again the second time in his own name , when the Interest yet did continue in another , as aforesaid , and causing me upon that account to go to London , and then never proceeded further against me . 

3.  To cause Robert Carnil to be arrested upon forfeiture of the Bond , when I had discharged the Bond by my own Appearance , and by an Attorney had caused my Appearance to be entered according to their practice , and causing the said Robert falsely to be imprisoned about twelve weeks . 

4.  To sue me again this last time , and having caused my Corn to be taken and spoilt as aforesaid ; and there being now Ecclesiastical Courts , in which all Cases of Tithes are to be tried , according to that Law , and not in any Temporal Court whatsoever , which doth amount to false Imprisonment for so long as I shall continue a Prisoner upon this account . 

then concerning others , which have been employed by him in that very business , who have acted illegally and contrary to Law ; As first , John Taylor coming into my dwelling house , and there arresting my body , when the day of Appearance was past according to the Warrant , and so he had no authority nor lawful power , either to come into my house , or to arrest my body . 

then concerning those that have forcibly taken away my Corn , though I did never oppose them by resisting , yet against them all I bear forth my Testimony in the Truth ; and there were four concerned in that matter , namely , Sutton of Besthorp , Daulton of South-scarle , Richard Light foot of North-collingham , and Pocklington's own Servant , whose name I know not ; and I did let all these men know , as I had opportunity to speak to them , that they did me wrong , and warned them to take heed what they did in that case , and told them I did not give any consent for them to take away my Corn ; yet notwithstanding they proceeded so to do from time to time , which doth amount on their part to a forcible taking , though never opposed by resisting ; and besides , the Law doth not give any such power to take Tithes , but only binds the party to set them forth , and not to carry them away ; therefore these persons aforesaid , are no lesle than deep transgressors of the Law , and have made themselves liable to the Law , as there is freedom to make use of their own weapon : and hereby all sober people may see , how this man's house hath been furnished with envy , and though he hath had so many years to empty it , yet he hath not cleared it , as by his practice is manifest ; but I desire his eyes may be opened , and that he may see the end of those things , and come to Repentance before it be too late , for his glass is almost run , and without Repentance his end will be bitterness ; and I would have him know , that there is a righteous God that judgeth between him and me this day , and into his hand alone I commit my innocent Cause . 

Something touching the Ground of Tithes ; by which it doth appear , that Tithes are not of right upon any account , in any place , or to any person at this day ; neither can any Law be truly grounded from the Scriptures of Truth , either to give them , or to sell them . 

The Law was given by Moses , and under that Law Tithes „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ ; and they were not to keep them back , for in „Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ was a complaint that they rob God ; and they were to bring their Tithes into the Storehouse , that there might be meat enough , and that the Fatherless , Strangers , and Widows might be relieved , and not want : and here was the first Covenant with its Law , and Priesthood , and Tithes , and Temple , and Sacrifices , and Offerings of diverse sorts ; and Meats , and Drinks , and diverse washings ; all which was but a figure of him that was to come , Christ Jesus : for the Law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; and when through those figures and shadows the better hope was brought in , than was Moses and his Administration fulfilled , with all things that did pertain unto it ; and in fullness of time Christ Jesus came , and Grace and Truth came by him ; which Grace and Truth is free , and ends the first Covenant , with all its Services and Ordinances , and establisheth a new Covenant upon better promises , in which Covenant Christ Jesus is known to be the Highpriest over the house of God , and there is the Gospel free , without money or without price , and the Grace free which saveth , and not the works of the first Covenant ; and it was never the practice of Christ or his Apostles , to take Tithes , or to sue people for them ‚ñ™ neither is the name of an Impropriator to be found in all the Scriptures , and how these things are come to pass let people consider ; for Christ nor his Disciples did never receive Tithes , neither gave any Commandment for any man to take them , or for any man to pay them ; then such as now take them , and sue people at Law for them , do not walk either by precept or example from Christ or his Apostles , and therefore their practice is altogether unlawful ; and out of the Truth , and all Impropriators are wholly excluded throughout the Scriptures ; for Tithes under the Law were never appointed to any under that name , therefore they cannot have any just right in them . 

Object . But some may say , Surely they have the greatest right to Tithes , because they have purchased them ; and the Law hath made Tithes to become unto them , as an Estate in Fee Simple ? 

Ans . There not being either precept or precedent from Christ nor his Apostles , nor no such Institution under the Gospel , it must needs remove this Objection wholly ; and that any man can have just power to sell the labour of another , or any increase that rises from his labour , and to give unto another person an interest in it , as an Estate of Inheritance , this will not stand with the reasonable part of a man : for that which doth arise to one man through the labour of another man , cannot stand for a certain Interest ; because it cometh through labour and charge , and not through any thing certain ; so that if a man labour not , than the party that doth claim an interest in his Increase , is wholly disseized and dispossessed of that part which he claims as an Inheritance : and the selling and buying of Tithes is come in of late years , compared with the years since the Apostles time ; and both the buyer and the seller were under a vail of thick darkness at that time , which the Light of the Lord doth now make manifest ; and it is now seen with a clear eye , that such things are come to pass in the Apostasy , and instituted after the Inventions of men , and not after Christ the Wisdom of God ; and therefore they are now to be denied , and the Root of them plucked up and destroyed , and not to stand in any place , nor unto any man ; for Grace and Truth is come by Jesus Christ , in which Grace and Truth the Freedom is known , and Tithes , as now used in England , are an invention of the Pope , and who would know their rise and setting up , must look into Histories for their ground , for in the Gospel-scriptures there is no ground for them to stand upon ; and Verstegen an Antiquary doth relate their very rise in England , and doth declare that Pope Gregory sent over a company of his Priesthood and Officers into the Island of England , who preached their Doctrine , and turned many to their Faith ; and then the Pope sent them a Letter , to take the free gift of such as they had converted , and to live upon it : which thing they at the first did , as the History relates , and those gifts were all brought into one place , out of which the necessities of those were supplied whom it concerned ; but after they had spread their Doctrine more generally , and that there was an increase amongst people in their practice , than they began to divide the whole into particulars , and appointed to each man his place of Cure , which he was to take the charge of , and to receive their particular gifts , but not to receive or take of any other but such as were of his Faith , and owned his practice ; And here was the first institution of Parishes and Parish Churches in England , according to History : and when they were thus settled , and that the gifts would not answer their particular ends , some beginning to cool in their love , and in their zeal , and were not so liberal in giving as sometimes they had been ; then the Pope decreed a Law , and by that Law , gave his Priest's power to compel the Tenth part of increase from all People generally , which before was but a free gift from some , as may be seen more at large in the History . And here was the first ground of Parishes in England , and out of which Parish Churches are sprung , which People now make so much to do about : And here also was the first Law for compelling the payment of Tithes . And after process of time , it came to pass that the Pope's power was denied in England , than what had been gained unto Abbeys and Monastries , with a great part of predial Tithes was disposed into a general service , by way of Sale , and so became converted into the hands of Lay persons , who were called Impropriators : And here is the ground from whence they rise , and all the right they can claim originally for their Tithes . And now , Whether the Parish Churches , and Tithes , and Worship , which are practised in Parish Churches , have a sound root , let all moderate People consider ? And whether their ground be sufficient for any man to persecute another , either for not paying Tithes , or for not going to the Parish Church , or for not Conforming to the Worship which there is practised ? And how People can stand by these things , and yet profess Christianity ? And whether they do not stand upon a slippery place , let them all consider ? But many are come to know the Lord Jesus Christ , and by his power are redeemed out of all Inventions , and Will-worships , and are made a free People in his Life , and Wisdom , and he over all is exalted , and his Kingdom is set , and standeth firm , in which is Righteousness , and Peace , and Joy for ever . 

And now the root of this matter being found in a corrupted earth , the fruit of its nature hath its perfect savour ; and many have tasted of its bitterness from time to time , until this day ; and there hath been since the first Institution , several Laws made , for the continuing of the payment of Tithes in general , yet by all the Laws in that case made , the recovering of Tithes was referred to the Ecclesiastical Courts , and by Ecclesiastical Judges , and not in any Temporal Court whatsoever , as in diverse Statutes for recovering of Tithes may be mentioned . One in particular I shall quote , namely , 3.  Edw. 6.  Chap. 13.  And that it shall not be lawful unto the Parson , Vicar , Proprietor , Owner or other their Farmer , or Deputies , contrary to this Act , to convent or sue such withholder of Tithes , Obventions , or other Duties aforesaid , before any other Judge than Ecclesiastical . By which it doth appear , how much innocent People are this day wronged in that case , who are sued for Tithes , by original Wirts out of Temporal Courts ; and likewise how much they are wronged through the practice that is used in that Law , and how many this day lie in Holes and Prisons , because the Practice of the Law hath been made a snare unto them , so that they could not proceed in their own case , as of right they ought to have done , and this is manifest in many particulars ; a few of which I shall briefly instance . 

1.  To be arrested by a Sheriff's Warrant , grounded upon an original Written out of any Temporal Court ; and by that Warrant the Sheriff is to have the Body of a man in the Court at Westminster such a day as is expressed , there to answer the Party who hath aught to pled against him , and then the Body of that man to be cast into Prison , and there kept , and not brought into the Court by the Sheriff , according to the Warrant ; is a practice through which many innocent People suffer this day in a deep manner , and is a practice that stands wholly in deceit , lies , and hypocrisy . 

2.  For a man to give Bond for his appearance upon his arrest , and he doth appear accordingly , and in the truth discharges his Bond ; yet notwithstanding his appearance will not be accepted to be good in Law , though by the Law it is only sufficient ; and then to proceed against him upon forfeiture of his Bond , when in the Truth , and also according to Law , he hath really discharged his Bond : this is a deceitful Practice , and through this Practice many innocent People have suffered . 

3.  To be Subpenaed into the Exchequer , and commanded to appear there in a man 's own person , and when he doth personally appear , than not to accept his appearance , to be good in Law , and in that case to proceed against him as an offender , and to cause his Body to be arrested and imprisoned for a contempt , when he hath truly answered what he was commanded ; this is a practice through which many innocent People do suffer . 

4.  For a man to give his own Answer unto any Bill exhibited against him , and to answer it in the Truth , and to tender his Answer to the Court , and that Answer to be refused , as not being sufficient in Law , when it is a man 's own Answer , who by the Law is required to answer , and no Law that enjoins him to answer otherwise ; and notwithstanding his Answer truly tendered , yet to be arrested and imprisoned for a contempt , when he hath observed the thing commanded : this is a practice through which many innocent People suffer . 

5.  To refuse an Answer as insufficient , because a man cannot swear unto it , though in itself it be really true ; and then to cause that man to be arrested , and imprisoned for a contempt , when he hath tendered a true Answer : this is a practice through which many innocent People suffer . 

6.  There being no Law in force , by which any Temporal Court can receive power to proceed in the case of Tithes , it is wholly insufficient on their part , who put such things in practice ; through which practice many have and do very deeply suffer . 

Therefore who are yet in suffering for Tithes , and remain in Prisons upon the account of such proceedings in any Temporal Court , they ought by the Law to be forthwith discharged , and released ; and not only so , but to be repaired for their great sufferings , loss , and damage which they have sustained by such illegal proceedings , and deceitful practices ; through which many have suffered to Death , others to the great loss of their outward Estates , and others to the decay of their bodily Health , by being so long continued in hardships , who are men of ability , and repute in their Country ; and Liberty may be justly challenged and demanded touching all that yet do suffer upon the account here mentioned , and also for these Reasons following . 

1.  Because many who are in Bonds this day , were cast into Prison by Writs original from the Temporal Courts , whose Authority was upheld by Oliver's Power , and now his Power being disannulled , and all that was acted and done by his Power , made void by this present Power , and is now judged ineffectual to all intents and purposes as if it had never been : then why should not that judgement reach to the Innocent , and set them free from their sufferings , which originally was occasioned by his Power , and have for many years together continued Prisoners ? I am sure sound Reason , or a tender heart , will judge this demand both lawful and expedient to be granted . 

2.  This present Power now being in Government , under which Power there are Courts Ecclesiastical appointed ; then all that have been Arrested , by Writs original from any Temporal Court , since this present Power Governed , and who do remain in Prisons upon such Arrests , in case of Tithes ; their Liberty may be justly challenged and demanded , and it will be but a reasonable thing for such as are now in Power to grant it , and cause it to be done . 

I do not state these Cases as being versed in points of Law , but as they are opened to me in the Truth , in which Truth is the pure and sound Reason ; and that Truth and Reason seeth thorough all things that are unreasonable , and also manifests what is reasonable , that the Truth and sound Reason , in another may answer it , and receive it ; and in the Truth man comes to see all vunreasonable things : and let all reasonable People now judge whether it be reasonable on their part , that practise such things as are here mentioned , and through such practices cause Innocent People to suffer ? and whether it be reasonable that Innocent People should yet suffer and be continued in Prison upon such grounds ? And whether such as now do suffer in those cases , can be lawfully detained , being Imprisoned upon original Writs in case of Tithes ? And though such things were done , when there was not another way left to recover them , and greedy men would not be satisfied without them , though at that time there was such a practice and proceedings ; yet that Power being now judged unlawful , and removed , such things are returned into their old channel again , and are to be tried in Ecclesiastical Courts only : Not that I hereby justify the proceedings of any Court in this case , for I have already showed the ground of this matter to be corrupted ; and am now wading amongst the fowl and unclean streams , where I find little delight as to myself , but through a necessity laid upon me , to do good both to Persecutors and Sufferers , I am constrained to travel amongst these things , though I hasten through them , as contraries to my Life . Now these things being duly considered , it cannot but reasonably be judged , that we have good cause , who in these cases are concerned , to demand our just Liberty , and do expect it ; and if Liberty be denied unto us upon this reasonable demand , then let such know who are our Oppressors , that we yet in patience do abide , and in patience we do bear a sure Testimony against all evil-doers and unreasonable men . And here it may be seen what bitter streams the Pope's fountain sendeth forth ; and not only so , but also how those that are concerned in the practice of the Law , do degenerate from reasonable men , and with their unreasonable part do divert the streams from their proper course ; though in that channel they are too bitter for honest men to drink , yet being diverted from that course , they are made much more bitter from such as do practice in them : for if any part of Reason did order the practice in such cases , it would not prove so tedious and burdensome to those that are concerned to make defence ; If a man 's own Appearance would be taken for a sufficient Appearance , as it ought to be ; or , if a true Answer would be taken for a sufficient Answer , without an Oath , as it ought to be ; or , if the Sheriff would have a man's Body to appear according to his Warrant , as he ought to do ; this would come something near to Reason in practice , and would not be so grievous to poor men , who desire to fear God and walk in his Truth : but men are shamefully degenerated from Truth and Reason , and their very hearts and minds are corrupted , and their ways are all crooked , and there is no soundness in their goings , so that an hovest simple man cannot walk with them , but be defiled and ensnared . 

And now I shall mention one thing , and that from the Law , for confirmation of what I have here laid down in the particular case of Tithes , by which it doth fully appear that no Temporal Court hath any power to proceed against any man in that case ; for the Law saith after this manner , ( 32.  Hen. 8. ch . 7. ) That some have not letted to subtract the lawful and accustomed Tithes of Corn , Hay , Pasturages , and other sorts of Tithes and Oblations , commonly due to the owners , proprietors , and other possessors , etc.  wherefore it is enacted , That all and singular persons of what estate or degree soever , shall fully and truly , and effectually divide , yield , or pay , all and singular Tithes and Offerings aforesaid , etc. and if any do detain any part of the said Tithes or Offerings , than the party either Ecclesiastical or lay person , having cause to demand the said Tithes , and being thereof wronged or grieved , shall and may convent the person or persons , so offending , before the Ordinary , his Commissary , or other competent Minister or lawful Judge of the place where such wrong shall be done , according to the Ecclesiastical Laws , etc.  And another branch of the Statute speaketh on this wise , That if any Ecclesiastical or Spiritual profits , which now be , or hereafter shall be made Temporal unto any person or persons ; and that if any other person or persons go about to disseise them , or disinherit them , then in that case the party or parties grieved , may have their remedy in the Temporal Courts , as may be seen more at large in the full Statute . So here is a plain distinction made : for whilst any thing remains in the nature of Tithes , and only denied as Tithes and Offerings , no Temporal Court hath power to examine or determine in that case , but the Ecclesiastical Courts only : but if any man shall call in question the Estate of another in the ground , as it was once counted Spiritual , and now converted into the possession of a lay person , if an Interest in this case be questioned , then have the Temporal Courts power to examine and determine the Interest of such Estate . And there are diverse other Statutes which do refer the recovering of Tithes , where they are denied , to the determination of Ecclesiastical Courts only , which I shall not at this time , and in this place , take notice of to mention ; for that which is already said , may be sufficient to convince a reasonable man or woman , that the ground and rise of them is out of the Truth ; and the way to recover them , if denied , is to be in Ecclesiastical Courts only , and not in Temporal Courts , and that from determination of the Law in that case . All which doth make it evidently appear , how much we have been , and are still wronged , who have been a suffering People many years in this case , and through these practices ; and the wrong is much more at this time in this case , than in times lately passed , because there is now Ecclesiastical Courts set up and appointed , unto which the Law doth only refer for the recovering of Tithes , and some that in those Courts are called in question about Tithes : and therefore the People of God , who are called Quakers , aught to be set free from their Imprisonments in that case , who have been wronged so long together , and yet are sufferers by Writs , and Warrants , and Subpena's out of Temporal Courts , and through the practice of such Courts : And if any man be henceforth grieved for want of his Tithes , then let us come to answer in such Court's as by the Law is appointed to hear and determine the same ; and let us have free liberty to make our just and reasonable Defence on our own behalf , and not to be interrupted in our Defence , for it is a Case that doth relate to our Consciences ; and therefore such as are counted Spiritual men , who are appointed to judge in Spiritual matters , aught to hear us to the full in what we have to say in our own Defence , that so our Answer may be taken and considered , touching the matter which by any Bill may be exhibited against us ; and then however it comes to pass concerning us , or what Sentence may proceed against us , we shall be contented in our places , and shall either actively or passively be subject without resisting , as our Testimony hitherto doth sufficiently evidence for us ; only let us have fair dealings , and legal proceedings , as Men and Christians : for , as Men , we have a perfect understanding , and in truth and soberness we do behave ourselves ; and , as Christians , we have patience to endure , and do not seek revenge ; and therefore we ought to have fair dealings amongst all men who are concerned with us in any case . 

There are other corrupted streams , which descend from the unreasonable part of men towards us , and are practised in diverse cases concerning us , by which great sufferings are inflicted upon us ; and such practices may briefly be reduced into these particular heads . 

1.  To summon us to appear at Sessions , and when we appear according to our Summons , and stand at the Bar to make our just Defence to what may be charged against us , then to tender unto us the Oath of Allegiance , and press us with much violence to take it ; and though that Oath was instituted touching another people , as by the title of it may appear , which is for suppressing Popish Recusants ; and it was instituted in the sense of that danger which was by such a people intended against the King and his Government , by the Gunpowder-plot ; and though afterwards it was pressed to the King , that he would grant the extent of it to all his Subjects , and that he gave his consent so to do , yet it may be seen by that Law which did so institute it in that case , and upon the request of that Parliament , that the Intention and mind both of the King and Parliament , was for the finding out of such a people as did adhere to the Pope's Supremacy ; and though it doth extend to all , as to the tender of it , yet it is with certain considerations ; as if any Officer of a Township do complain to a Justice of Peace , that any person or persons above the age of sixteen years , do not duly repair to their Parish Church , or do not duly receive that which is called a Sacrament , as in the said Act is more fully expressed , That then in such cases the Justice of Peace hath power to send for such person or persons , so complained of , by his Warrant , and may tender unto them the said Oath , which for refusing , he hath power to proceed against them , as is appointed by the said Act : but still it is to be observed , that it is but to discover such person or persons as privately do adhere to the Pope's Supremacy ; and therefore it is expressed in the Oath , that they shall renounce the Pope ; and Praemunire was ordained only against such persons as should purchase Bulls from Rome , as may be seen in the 16th of Rich. 2d . chap. 5.  And now to make this the great business in Courts , and at other times against us , who are an innocent People , who deny the Pope's Supremacy and all his practices , and to entrap us with it , as with a snare , because we cannot for Conscience towards God take any Oath at all , but live in obedience to Christ's Command , who saith , Swear not at all ; and it is the matter contained in the Oath that was chiefly intended in the first institution of it , and now to ensnare us with it upon every occasion , who make conscience of an Oath , and yet answer the matter as full as any people : for our peaceable living under the King's Government , doth evidently demonstrate our obedience to him , whilst many others that fear not an Oath , can swear and yet not answer the matter contained in the Oath ; and here we show forth our obedience to the King , by answering the matter in the Oath ; and we also show forth our true love to God in keeping his Command , for it is Christ's Command that we do obey in this case ; and so it is to us the Conscience of an Oath , and not wholly the matter ; and to proceed against us in this case , is very hard measure ; and how many of us that have suffered Imprisonment , and spoiling of our goods , and diverse other ways have deeply suffered by it , and through the practice of it , though we are not at all concerned , by the intention of those from whom the Oath had its first institution ; and for to fine us , or imprison us in this case , as hath been , and is yet practised , is not only unreasonable from the consideration of these grounds here mentioned , but it is also a practice which standeth opposite to the Law itself , as in the 42.  Edw. 3d. ch . 3. where it is expressed , That for the good government of the Commons , no man shall be put to answer without presentment before Justices , or matter of Record , or by due Process and Writ original , according to the old Law : and if any thing from henceforth be done to the contrary , it shall be void and holden for error , etc.  Now by this Law none should be put to answer without Presentment , or matter of Record , or due Process ; Therefore to wave a Presentment upon which the party stands presented , and for which cause he is summoned there to appear , and doth appear , and then to tender the Oath unto him , and put him strictly to answer whether he will swear or no , it is not legal in Law ; for there is no Presentment , nor matter of Record , nor due Process against him in that case ; and to say , Will you take the Oath of Allegiance ? or , Will you swear ? when a Presentment lies against him in another case , and he stands at the Bar to answer his Charge , and if he do not give a full Answer to that Question as it is demanded , which as a new thing is tendered , and goes beside the matter for which he stands presented , and to fine him , or imprison him , because he doth not give a full Answer , is a Proceeding void in Law , and holden for error ; because no man is to be put to answer without Presentment , or matter of Record , or due Process . 

2.  To be imprisoned , and kept as a Prisoner , and at the Assizes or Sessions brought to the Bar as a Prisoner , and then to tender the Oath of Allegiance , when a man stands a Prisoner at the Bar , and expecteth a due Trial in order to his Releasement , and if he desire to hear his Charge , as a Prisoner , which every Prisoner ought to do , and to call for his Accusers , if any be , who ought to be there present , and that he stand upon the case of his Imprisonment , and doth not give a full Answer to the Question demanded about the Oath ; then to proceed against him as a refuser of the Oath , and to Fine him , or Imprison him , or Disseise him of his Freehold , or any other Estate : It is a Proceeding void in Law , and held for Error ; for in that case he should not be put to answer . 

3.  To be Imprisoned for meeting together to worship God , and to be kept in Prison many weeks , and then to be brought into a Court and set to a Bar of Judgement , and there have the Oath tendered , and no charge imposed upon the Prisoner , touching his Imprisonment , but the Oath alone pressed , and his Answer required , & for not answering fully to the Question demanded , which generally is this , Will you take the Oath of Allegiance ? Or , Will you Swear ? And so to be Fined , or Imprisoned upon the account of refusing the Oath ; or , to have his Lands and Goods seized , in the case of Praemunire ; this is void in Law , and holden for Error : For no Presentment , nor matter of Record , or due Process in that case , lies against the Prisoner ; and the Law saith , That no man , of what Estate or Condition that he be , shall be put out of Land or Tenement , nor taken , nor Imprisoned , nor Disinherited , nor put to Death , without being brought to answer by due Process of the Law , 28.  Edw. 3d. Chap. 3.  And again Magna Charta , Chap. 29.  no Freeman shall be taken or Imprisoned , or be Disseized of his Freehold , or Liberties , or free Customs , or be Outlawed or Exiled , or any other ways Destroyed ; nor we will not pass upon him , nor condemn him but by Lawful Judgement of his Peers , or by the Law of the land And in 3.  Charles 1  And I assure you , my Maxim is , That the People's Liberties strengthens the King's Prerogative , and that the King's Prerogative is to defend the People's Liberties . And again , 3.  Charles 1. in the Petition of Right , no Free man to be Imprisoned without cause showed . And how contrary to these things have men acted against us , who are called Quakers ? and how have they made their Wills their Law , and in their Wills have Imprisoned us , without any cause at all showed , and have restrained us of our Liberty , though Free men of England , contrary to Magna Charta , and diverse Statutes which have been made for the preservation of the Freeborn People of England , of which number we are , and can challenge as much Liberty by our Birthright , in all just Privileges , as any People whatsoever ? and therefore if the good and sound Law was observed , we should be outwardly the Freest of all People in this Nation , as inwardly we are by Christ Jesus , and should not come within the compass of any Law , as Transgressor's ; for by the Law itself it is expressed , That the Law of God is the Law of the Land , and that no man of what estate , degree , or condition he be , hath power to dispense with God's Laws ; and the Law of God doth not take hold of the righteous , but sinners , and disobedient , of murderers , and thiefs , and evil-doers ; and when hath the Law taken hold upon us as such a People ? Hath evil-deeds been found amongst us ? or have we ever been brought before a Judgement Seat , and justly charged with any misdemeanour ? And are not we then cleared by the Law of God , which is righteous ? and the Law itself saith , That the Law of God is the Law of the Land , and , no man hath power to dispense with the Law of God ; as in the 28.  Hen. 8.  Chap. 7.  And if this was practised , than no imprisonment nor restraint , should be by any man exercised towards us , nor no spoiling of our goods and estates would fall upon any of us , but in all things we should be Protected by the Law of the Land , as we are Justified by the Law of God ; and then we should meet without any disturbance , and Worship our God in his unlimited Spirit , and the Law would stand by us in it , and in all that we practise in answer to God we should be Protected ; and that which the Lord increaseth unto us , would not be taken from us , and spoilt , nor an Oath upon any account would be tendered to us ; For by the Law of God , which is Holy , and Spiritual , and Just , and Good , our Meetings are lawful , the Increase of our Estates is our own , and our Yea , and Nay , is true without an Oath , and all that we practise in Conscience towards God , is by the Law of God justified : And therefore no Law , Statute , or Ordinance , aught to stand against us , seeing that no man hath power to dispense with God's Law. And , is it not the great cry against us , You will not be obedient to the Laws , but are a wilful People , and run yourselves into danger and sufferings in your own wills , & therefore you deserve to be punished . But let all people know , that in what we practise , we are justified by the Law of God ; and if any Law in the Land do condemn us , & inflict punishment upon us for our practice , than it is not what the Law itself saith it is , but from another ground ; and we do not run in our own wills to do those things that we practise , but through a necessity in the eternal motion of God's power we are constrained to bear testimony unto the Truth , as we have received ; and I am very sure that in answering the Lord in obedience to what he lays upon us , we have the answer of a good Conscience in it , and peace with God ; and his righteous Law justifies us , and the Law of the Land ought not to condemn us , or punish us ; and let foolish People learn to be wise and not charge the motion of God's Spirit , to be an unruly Will , lest they be found in the unpardonable sin ; for we are a People unknown amongst the Sons of men , though our Testimony stands in Innocency to their view , yet our Life is hid from their eyes , and they know us not , because they know not him . And do not People from their apprehension of our transgression of the Law , take occasion against us , and persecute and spoil us , whilst they themselves are the transgressors , and that by their own Law ; which saith , The Law of God is the Law of the Land : And the Law of God saith , thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ; but he that will Imprison him , and spoil his goods , and persecute him , doth not love him , so is a transgressor ; but we are free , and the Law of God doth not charge guilt upon us , nor condemn us in the things we practise ; and therefore it must needs be that such as act against us are the transgressors , and whatsoever stands for Law this day , which doth condemn our practice , and punish us for the using of it , the same doth differ from the Law of God , and so degenerates from that Conclusion which the Law itself makes , and in plain words expresseth , That the Law of God is the Law of the land And through the miscarriages of men towards us , whose wills have wrested the Law in diverse cases , we have through such things deeply suffered ; and yet the yoke is continued upon us , and our Innocency is made a prey upon , for we being a quiet People , and disposed in the principle of Love towards all men , and cannot seek revenge upon any , therefore are our afflictions increased , whether with Law , or without Law , or against Law , it is not by many much regarded , as in diverse cases might be truly instanced , which is at present waved . 

And seeing that the Law itself doth make such a Conclusion of its own standing , that it is the Law of God , then to examine a little some particulars , and places in it , if in all things it have perfect agreement with the Law of God ; for the Law of God is pure , holy , just and good ; and as it hath been showed , that the practice in diverse cases doth degenerate from the Law of the Land , so it may come to pass that the Law of the Land may degenerate from the Law of God ; for the Law of God speaketh on this wise , 

1.  thou shalt not bow to any graved Image , nor the likeness of any thing ; And whatsoever is set up , and not by the Spirit of the Lord , is graved out of an imagination , and is an Image , and to bow unto that thing is to bow unto a graved Image ; and if the Law of the Land do restrain from such a practice , than it standeth right , but if it do allow such things , or rather compel people to practise such things , then doth it degenerate from the Law of God.  

2.  The Law of God saith , thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain ; And to Swear by his Name , is to take his Name in vain ; and if the Law of the Land do restrain people from all manner of Oaths , than it standeth right , but if it do allow such things , or rather in some cases , compel into such things , then doth it degenerate from the Law of God.  

3.  Christ Jesus the Lawgiver saith , thou shalt love the Lord thy God , and thy Neighbour as thyself ; and to love God , is to keep his Commandments ; and to love a Neighbour , as to love a man's self , is to do him good , and not to harm him ; Now if the Law of the Land do encourage such things , than it standeth right , but if it do allow the breaking of God's Commands , and teach men so ; or if it do allow one Neighbour to spoil the goods of another , or in some cases rather compel such things to be done , than it doth degenerate from the Law of God , and from the Doctrine of Christ Jesus . 

4.  Christ Jesus the Lawgiver saith , God is a Spirit , and must be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth ; Now if the Law of the Land do allow such a worship and protect it , than it standeth right , but if it do prohibit it , or rather compel from it , than it doth degenerate from the Law of God , and from the Doctrine of Christ Jesus ; and in this case , two things are very considerable to be minded , and not to be practised . 

1.  Not to bind People's Consciences into any Practice , or into any Worship which in their own Conscience they are not persuaded into , nor to compel a Conformity unto any Practice or Worship which standeth not in the Spirit and in the Truth ; for to use Force and Compelling-laws in such Cases , is but to force People to bow unto an Image , or to the likeness of a thing which the Law of God doth expressly forbid . 

2.  Not to prohibit or forbid People for meeting together in any place , or at any time above such a number ; for this is to limit God , if it were possible , and to restrain tender Consciences from their holy Exercise in God's Spirit , and to keep them from the pure Worship , which standeth in the Spirit , and in the Truth only ; and to stop them from that practice which the Father seeks them to perform ; for Christ saith , the Father seeketh such to worship him : and no Law of the Land ought to take place to diminish that Liberty which any People have in the Spirit , nor to prohibit that Worship that is performed to God in the Spirit , though in the practice there may be contrary minds amongst them ; for the Spirit of the Lord God is free , and without limitation ; and all that are born of the Spirit they are a freeborn People , and their Worship stands singly to God in the Spirit and in the Truth ; and though there may be a difference in Worships outwardly , and amongst the Worshippers in point of practice , yet none ought by any outward Law , either to compel or prohibit each other , for that is peculiar to God alone ; and no man is to stand up in Judgement concerning it , or to bind the Conscience of another by an outward Law , either to observe the one , or to deny the other ; for whoever hath outward Power to rule , and would set that Power to judge in matters of Conscience , Worship and Religion , and from their own Judgement in such cases , make Laws , to compel to one thing , and to restrain from another thing , such Laws do degenerate from the Law of God , and from the Doctrine of Christ Jesus , and from his Life and Wisdom : And therefore these things considered and weighed , it will be found of great necessity to search well into the Laws ; and where any are found to oppose the righteous Law of God , and yet stand in force in any such case , to repeal them , that so the Law of the Land may be reduced into the truth of its own saying , and stand in Justice , Equity and Mercy , as doth the Law of God ; then Persecution would cease about Religion , and there would be a stream of perfect Liberty to all tender Consciences , and no Restraint would be upon any in case of Worship or Religion , otherways living peaceably in the Nation ; so would hearts and minds of men come into Love , into Peace , and into Settlement and good Order , and it would allay all the heat and heartburning amongst men , and cool them and quiet them ; and then there would not need Swords and Spears to preserve Order : for People coming to that of God in themselves , and worshipping and serving God in the Spirit and in the Truth , and every one standing in the spirit 's Liberty ; then People would settle and be quiet , and love one another , and be at Peace one amongst another , and there would be good Order through the Nation ; but this being wanting , and Compelling-laws ruling , it makes Broils in the Nation , and causeth Distractions amongst People , which would be prevented , if Liberty in matter of Worship and Religion was granted and tolerated : And what harm would this do to any man ? or what prejudice could come to any man by so doing ? Surely none at all , but rather happiness both to such as rule , and such as are ruled ; and the comfort of it would be found to be very great unto all that truly fear the Lord : And this is the Liberty which the King's Prerogative is to defend , according to the Maxim of Charles the first . But however it hath been , or yet is with us in these cases outwardly , our trust is in the Lord God , and in him we do rejoice ; and we desire that all people were likeminded with us , and were as we are , except our Bonds and Afflictions ; for the Presence of the Lord God is with us , and by his Arm we are supported , and through all these things the Truth standeth , and that is the Word of the Lord to all people , Truth standeth : And if any yet think with themselves that with their strength they can prevail against the Truth , then let them try their strength , but let them also mind what will be the end of it ; for this I know in the Truth , that whosoever rises against the Truth will toil themselves in vain , and spend their strength for naught , and in the end will lie down in sorrow ; for Truth standeth : And how many have come up , and have appeared in full strength , and have been permitted to have a blow at Truth ? but how are they wasted , and how are they passed away and perished ! yet Truth standeth . Therefore all people , fear the living God , and in time be warned , for no weapon form against the Truth shall prospero ; for Truth standeth over all , and Christ Jesus reigneth , his Power , and Glory and Dignity is set on high , and in his Love all Wrath is swallowed up ; and here is the beginning known , and here is the ending set ; for the Love of God was first , and the Love of God is last , and here is the finishing of the Work , and the closing up in perfect Peace ; and with this Love all contrary Being's are comprehended , and in its own Being it remains unchangeable , and it is Truth and no lie ; and Truth standeth , Glory to the Most High for ever and ever , Amen . 

W. S.  Here is the Wisdom and Patience of the Saints : Who have ears to hear , let them hear .
