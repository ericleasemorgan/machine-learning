An account of what passed between the King and Richard Hubberthorn , after the delivery of George Fox his letter to the King . 

R. h.   Since the Lord hath called and gathered us to be a persons to walk in his fear , and in his truth , we have always suffered , and been persecuted by the powers that have ruled ; and been made a prey of for departing from iniquity . And when the breach of no law could be charged against us , than they made laws on purpose to ensnare us , and so our sufferings were unjustly continue . 



K.   It is true , those that have ruled over you have been cruel , and have professed much which they have not done . 



R. h.   And likewise the same sufferings do now abound in more cruelty against us in many parts of this nation , as for instance , one at Thetford in Norfolk , where Henry fell ministering unto the persons , was taken out from the meeting and whipped , and sent out of that town from parish to parish , towards Lancashire , the chief ground of his accusation in his pass which was shown to the King was because he denied to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy ; and so because for conscience sake we cannot swear , but have learned obedience to the doctrine of Christ , who saith , swear not at all ; hereby an occasion is taken against us , to persecute us ; and as it is well known we have not sworn for any nor against any , but have kept to the truth , and our yea hath been yea , and our nay nay , in all things , which is more than the oath of those who are out of the truth . 



R.   But why can you not swear ? for an oath is a common thing among men to any engagement . 



R. h.   It is manifest , and we have seen it by experience , that it is so common amongst men to swear and engage either for or against things , that there is no regard taken of them , nor fear of an oath : that therefore which we speak from the bottom of our hearts is more than they swear . 



K.   But can you not promise as before the Lord , which is the substance of the oath ? 



R. h.   Yes , what we do affirm we can promise before the Lord , and take him to our witness in it ; but our so promising hath not been accepted ; but the ceremony of an oath they have stood for , without which all other things were accounted of none effect . 



K.   But how May we know from the words that you will perform ? 



R. h.   By proving of us , for they who swear are not known to be faithful but by proving of them , and so we by those who have tried us are found to be truer in our promise than others by their oaths , and to those that do yet prove us , we shall yet do the same . 



K.   Pray what is your principle ? 



R. h.   Our principle is that Jesus Christ is the true light which enlightens every one that cometh into the world , that all men through him Might believe , and that they are to obey and follow this light as they have received it , whereby they May be led unto God and unto righteousness and the knowledge of the truth that they May be saved . 



K.   This do all Christians confess to be truth , and he is not a Christian that will deny it ? 



R. h.   But many have denied it both in words and writings and opposed us in it , and above a 100  Books are put forth in opposition to this principle . 



Lords ,  Then some of the Lords standing by the k. said that none would deny that , one of the Lords asked how long we had been called Quakers , or did we own that name ? 



R. h.   That name was given us in scorn and derision about twelve years since , but there was some who lived in this truth before we had that name given us . 



K.   How long is it since you owned this judgement and way ? 



R. h.   It is near 12 years since i owned this truth according to the manifestation of it . 



K.   What is your name ? 



R. h.   Richard Hubberthorn . 



K.   Do you own the sacraments ? 



R. h.   As for the word sacrament i do not read of it in the scripture , but as for the body and blood of Christ i own , and there is no remission without blood . 



K.   Well that is it , but do you not believe that every own is commanded to receive it ? 



R. h.   This we believe that according as it is written in the scripture , that Christ at his last supper took bread and broke it , and gave it to his disciple , and also took the cup and blessed it , and said unto them , as often as ye do this , that is , as often as you break bread you show forth the Lord's death till he come , and this we believe they did , and they eat their bread in singleness of heart from house to house , and Christ did come again unto them according to his promise , after which they said , we being many are one bread , for we are all partakers of this own bread . 



K. friends .  Than one of the k. friends said , that is truth , for as many grains make one bread of they being many members are one body , another of them said , if they be bread they must be broken ? 



R. h.   There is difference between the bread he broke at his last supper , wherein they were to show forth his death as in a sign till he came , and this whereof he spoke they being many are one bread , for herein they were come more in the substance , and to speak more mystically as they know in the spirit . 



K. friends   Then they said it was truth and he had spoken nothing but the truth . 



K.   How know you that you are inspired by the Lord . 



R. h.   According as we read in the scriptures that the inspiration of the almighty gives understanding , for by its inspiration is an understanding given us of the things of God . 

Lord's then one of the Lords said how do you know you are led by the true spirit ? 



R. h.   This we know because the spirit of truth it reproves the world of sin , and by it we were reproved of sin , and also are led from sin unto righteousness and obedience of truth , by which effects we know it is the true spirit , for the spirit of the wicked oh doth not lead unto such things . 



K. and l.   Then the King and Lords said it was truth . 



K.   Well of this you May be assured that you shall none of you suffer for your opinions or religion , so long as you live peaceably and you have the word of a k. for it , and i have also given a declaration to the same purpose , that none shall wrong nor abusâ€¢ you . 



K.   How do you own magistrates or magistracy ? 



R. h.   Thus we own magistrates whomsoever is set up by God , either k. or supreme , or any set in authority by him , who are for the punishment of evil doers , and the praise of them that do well such we shall submit unto & assist in righteousness and civil things both by body and estate , and if any man do that which is unrighteous we must declare against it , only submit under it by a patient suffering , and not rebel against any by insurrections , plots , and contrivances . 



K.   Then the k. said it is enough . 



Lords ,  Than one of the Lords asked why do you meet together seeing every one of you have the church in yourselves ? 



R. h.   According as it is written in the scriptures the church is in God , thes. 1. 1. and they who feared the Lord did meet often together and speak one to another and were edyfied and comforted one in another , and so is our meeting together in the fear of the Lord , and to us it is profitable and herein we are edyfied and strengthened in the life of truth . 



K.   How did you first come to believe the scriptures were truth ? 



R. h.   I have believed the scriptures from a child to be a declaration of truth , when i had but a literal knowledge , natural education and tradition , but now i know the scriptures to be true by the manifestation and operation of the spirit of God fulfilling them in me . 



K.   In what manner do you meet , and what is the order in your meetings ? 



R. h.   We do meet in the same order as the persons of God did , waiting upon him , and if any have an exhortation from the Lord he May speak it , or if any have a word of reproof or admonition , and as every one hath received the gift , so they minister one unto another , and May be edyfied one by another . 

Lord , one of the Lords said , than you know not so much as you May know but there is a growth then to be admitted of ? 



R. h.   Yes , we do grow daily into the knowledge of the truth in our exercise and obedience to it . 



K.   Are any of your friends gone to Rome ? 



R. h.   Yes there is one in prison at Rome . 



K.   Why did you send him thither ? 



R. h.   We did not send him thither but he found something upon his spirit from the Lord whereby he was called to go to declare against superstition & idolatry which is contrary to the will of God . 



K. f.   The King's friends said there were two at Rome but one of them was dead . 



K.   Have any of your friends been with the great Turk ? 



R. h.   Some of our friends have been in that country . 



Some other things would have been spoken but the King passed away . 

Finis .
