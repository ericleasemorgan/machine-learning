A short testimony on the behalf of truth's innocency ; declared in plainness and simplicity , being done at the command of the Lord God , that all out of the truth May see their way and proceed no further . With a discovery of the national ministry , whose time now is , and is no more . 

By one who loves truth and righteousness , and desires the naticns' peace , and the good of all persons , who amongst many brethren is called a Quaker , but known by the name of William smith .

The truth of the Lord God endures for ever ; what it was in the beginning , it is the same at this day , and no man can lay another foundation ; it is pure , and the appearance of it is glorious , it doth not join with evil , neither hath any agreement with the works of darkness , it sheds itself abroad in the hearts of all that believe in it ; the intents of all hearts it makes manifest , and is a reprover of the workers of iniquity ; it seeks nothing of this world , neither joins to the glory thereof ; it comes from God , and seeks the glory of God , and this is the sent of God , who is true , and no unrighteousness in him , he comes forth from the father , and comes into the world , not to destroy the world but to bear witness unto the truth , that all in the truth Might believe ; he is meek and lowly , peaceable and gentle , full of mercy , goodness and compassion , he loves his enemies , and doth good to those that hate him ; there is no strife in him , but a patient suffering and forbearing ; when he is reviled he revileth not again , when he suffers he threatens not , but as a lamb he is led to the slaughter , and neither cries nor lists up his voice in the streets ; he is come forth in his might , and in his strength is risen , to cut the work short in righteousness , and to tread upon the high places of the earth , that man May know there is a God that ruleth in the kingdoms of the world , who is jealous of his glory , and will not give it to another , but in his right will reign , who is King of Kings , and of his government there is no end ; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is glorious , and this he is establishing upon the top of all mountains , and exalting over the high places of the earth , not with sound of trumpets or the alarm of war , or the mighty host of men and horses , but with the outstretched arm of his own power that he hath made bare in the sight of all nations ; he hath appeared in his power , and visited the poor in this day of his mercy , and hath helped the needy in their great distress ; he is come who hath been long waited for , and he is now revealed who is the salvation of God , he hath chosen a persons to delight in him , and gathered a remnant to make mention of his name , and to declare his goodness from day to day ; he leads them in his power , and order them in his wisdom ; and they are given up unto him , and are made willing to follow him ; he hath redeemed them to himself , and chosen them to be a peculiar persons ; they are not of the world as he is not of the world , but out of the world he hath gathered them , and over the world he hath set them , and they have no fellowship with it , but testifies against it , for which cause the world hates them , not knowing the life that is revealed in them , for they are born again of the immortal word , which mortal man doth not know , nor cannot comprehend in his earthly wisdom , therefore doth the birth after the flesh persecute the birth born of the spirit ; who knows him not in his appearance , nor cannot behold his glory who is full of grace and truth , but hath always turned against him and hated his appearance , and could not believe that it was he , and so hath persecuted and reviled him , crucified and slain him , and in whom he hath made himself manifest and chosen to delight in him , they have been always Counted the offscouring of the world as it is at this day ; and though we be hated of man , yet bear we no evil to any , but patiently gives our back to the smiter , and what is permitted we endure , and Counts reproaches great riches , and to suffer for righteousness sake more joy than to live in the pleasure of sin ; and though you strive against us , yet we are preserved , for we are born of the seed which is blessed for ever , & we abide in our tents and rest in the strength of the glory of our God , and none can curse us ; therefore be at rest concerning us , for you do not know us , nor our restingplace , where we are set down and are preserved in perfect peace , and are not in fear what man can do unto us ; and though we walk among you , and in the midst of you , we are not of you , nor have no fellowship with you nor with the works that are brought forth by you , for God hath redeemed us from amongst you , & chosen us to be a holy persons unto himself , that we May show forth his praise in walking blameless and harmless in the land of uprightness , and in the life of innocency , and we have nothing in our hearts but love to all , pitying those that are our enemies , praying that God would give them repentance unto life , for we are followers of him who laid down his life for his enemies , and made himself of no reputation , unto the cross humbled himself that sinners Might he saved , and enemies reconciled unto God , and this is his love to you all who would not have you perish , and he hath begotten the same mind in us , and our eye is toward him who is gone before us , and he is a leader and commander unto us , and we confess to him alone who is the Lord of glory and the Prince of peace , who unto peace hath called us and in peace to rest , that in peace we May conquer the nations , and in quietness overcome the persons that delight in war , and this is the conquering power unto which we are subject , and this is the captain of our salvation whom we follow , and we have not used either sword or spear , or looked unto the arm of flesh to be a defence unto us , neither is it in our hearts so to strive with any , or persecute any , or destroy any persons , but in peace to rest until he plead our cause , and execute judgement for us , that all May behold that we are a persons saved by the Lord , whom we follow in obedience to do his will , and in his power are made willing to go through good report and bad report , as deceivers and yet true , as dying and yet we live , and this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears , and we do not speak it , because it was the condition of saints before us , but as we are witnesses of it , through the leadings of the same spirit ; for you are not ignorant how many bad reports hath been raised and spread abroad concerning us , crying , report and we will report ; and so have reports been spread in the nation of the Quakers rising and cutting throats which are bad reports , yet we have gone thorough them in patience , having no guilt upon us concerning them , but stand clear before the Lord our God , and in our innocency are justified in his sight ; how are we Counted deceivers by the wise generation , and yet we are born into the truth , and walk in the truth , and live the life of truth , and we know the freedom that is wrought by it , and we have the seal of God's spirit , which hath revealed it in our inward parts , and this we go through in the leadings of God , in whom we have peace ▪ how often hath death been threatened to us by unreasonable men , and yet we are preserved in the power of God and live before him , and thus do we walk as a despised and an afflicted persons , and yet we are led through all , and in the power of God walks upon the top of all , and stand over all those things , and heed them not , for our delight is in the Lord our God , and in his righteous law we meditate day and night , that our minds May be exercised unto him , in that which is pure of him , that gives us peace with him & seals assurance of his everlasting love unto us ; so we mind not who are against us , or what is reported concerning us , or how we are Counted in this world , but we mind the light of Christ manifest in our consciences , and in the light our minds are exercised , and with the light all evil thoughts are judged , and we are justified before our God , & though the world be against us , taking counsel what course to take with us , and many fretting themselves about us , yet we do not frowardly strive with any man , but follow peace with all men , and in peace we are preserved when our enemies are confounded and overturned by the arm of God . Behold and see ye despisers , what a work is this , how can you believe when it is declared , that God should plead the cause of his chosen persons , and make bare his arm for his innocent lambs , and by his invisible power to over-turn the mighty counsels of men , when neither sword nor spear hath been on our side , nor any thing without us hath appeared for us , than hath our god been near at hand , and a present help he hath been unto us , and with his outstretched arm he hath from time to time delivered us from the wrath of unreasonable men ; and thus we have experienced his everlasting loving kindness , and his wonderful works we are made to declare amongst the children of men , that all May know there is no god like unto our god , unto whom alone we look , and our eye is towards him , and we cannot join with weapons of war , nor with any party who is striving with them , but we set all men aside in the work of our God , and cannot meddle with other men's matters , but looks unto the Lord and cries unto the god of our strength , and our eye is single to him , and our expectation is from him alone , and he hath never failed us , but hath appeared to deliver us , and in the strength of his own life hath wrought our works for us , and with the arm of his salvation he hath saved us , unto whom be glory , dominion and praise for evermore . 

Now all persons see and consider what is the ground that you appear so full of enmity against a persons that neither threatens you , nor appears against you , nor bears no evil will unto you ; is it because you are in fear of your persons , and that we seek to destroy you from off the earth ? Then let the offence cease , and be quiet in your minds , for we stand clear before our God , and in our innocency are justified in his sight , and neither our hearts nor hands have joined , nor can join with such a work ; therefore , be not afraid where no fear is , nor be not envious from groundless jealousies , but mind the light of Christ in your consciences , and wait to receive the love of God in it , that you May cease from anger , wrath , malice , or bearing evil will unto a persons who walks innocently before the Lord and towards all men : and that which troubles you , and is a terror to you , and brings fear upon you , it is your own consciences , for there is your trouble , terror and fear , and it will terrify you , and fearfulness will surprise you who are in the hypocrisy , for it is the same that passed through Egypt of old , and wrought mighty signs and wonders upon Pharaoh and all the Egyptians who stood in their hard-heartedness and would not obey the Lord , nor let Israel go , though God sent Moses to lead them out of Egypt , and from under Pharaoh's power , yet he withstood the Lord , and his heart was hardened against the mighty God , until every house was searched , and the first-born was smitten and died , and then there was a cry amongst the Egyptians , and great fear was upon the land , and then was the time come in which Israel should be set free : you must read that can , for he that wrought then is working at this day to break off the yoke that the oppressed May be set free , and he will not leave a house amongst you , but he will pass through it , & smite the first-born in it , that his seed May come forth from under your cruel oppression : and this i have received of the Lord , and declares it in the auth••ity of God , that all May dread before the holy one of Israel , and if your enmity arise towards us concerning the law of our God which in our hearts he hath written , and is holy , just and good , and that you cannot receive truth as it is made known unto us by the revelation of Jesus Christ , then be still in your minds and wait to receive counsel from God , and be not rash nor forward in an envious spirit , but be cool and moderate that you May receive an understanding in the things of God , for we dare not deny the truth which God hath made manifest in us , whatever you can do unto us , and if truth offend you , then are we clear from the offence , for truth gives not offence , but the wicked one takes offence at truth's appearance , and so the offence comes of yourselves , and the woe is to you who takes offence at the truth and turns against the little ones that are born into the life of it , and offends them by your cruelty and oppression ; therefore let it be well considered what truth is , and who they be that are come to the knowledge of it , and walks in it ; that while you are warring and fighting about that which you call truth , ye be not ignorant what truth is , and so set up error in truth's stead , and give judgement against Christ who is the truth and life , of whom we testify , and confess him before men , and that with boldness in his power , and we are not ashamed of the gospel , but bears witness of it to be the power of God , and necessity is laid upon us so to do , and we cannot be silent , but as the Lord gives utterance we are constrained to make mention of his name , and to declare his truth from day to day ; and we do not take thought concerning men that rise up against us , neither heed them as to what they can do unto us , therefore let not the preaching of the cross of Christ offend you , neither stumble at that stone any longer , least it fall upon you and grind you to powder , for our testimony is unto the name of Jesus , and that there is not salvation in any other name , and this is known in the light which is manifest from him , that lets all see the need of salvation , for this is your great want who are from the light , you want God's salvation , and so remains in your sins and in your lusts from whence wars and contentious do arise ; and this is truth unto you all persons , and do not Count us your enemies because we tell it you in plainness , and labours for you that you Might come to the knowledge of it and besaved by it , and though we have born much from you , and suffer much by you , yet this is our care for you that you May be saved , and our desires to God for you that he would not lay to your charge what you do unto us , and we stand innocent before the Lord in all things that have been done unto us or intended towards us , and we seek not revenge upon any man , and though truth be Counted heresy by such as are yet in darkness , yet we know the power of it , and the salvation in it , and after that way now called heresy so worship we the god of our fathers ; therefore all persons behold and see what your way is , and go not on to your own destruction , but cease from evil , and let not envy and malice lodge in your hearts , nor strive not in your wills against the truth of God , for he is establishing the throne of his glory , and who art thou that contends against him ? It were better for thee to be still and quiet , and meddle not in things too wonderful for thee , but let that alone which concerns the most high : therefore all persons , in time your ways consider , and proceed no further in that which is evil , which tends to persecution and destruction , but all take warning from the Lord , and all turn unto him , before the day of his fierce wrath come , for if you neglect the light of Christ in your consciences you neglect your salvation , and if you turn against the appearance of God in his persons , and conspire against the just , and murder the innocent , God will find you out , and the hour of his judgement will come , and his wrath will abide upon you for ever . So all mind the light of Christ within you , that is manifest from God unto you , that you May depart out of evil , and be led unto God from whence the light comes , that you May come to discern the things of God , and understand that which belongs to your peace , for all that the Lord hath gathered in this day of his mercy , to make known in them his wonderful works in his mighty power they walk in God's fear , & stand in his counsel , and knows all things in their place , and what is of God they honour , & what is of man they cannot own , for God hath raised his own seed that cannot consent to any custom or fashion or tradition of the world , but testifies against them all , and we are born of the seed which hath no part in the world , and in the power of it we are redeemed out of the world , therefore we cannot conform to the world neither in custom , fashion or tradition , nor we cannot exercise ourselves in any thing we are convinced of to be contrary to the truth , and this is all that you have against us , because we answer a conscience void of offence towards God and man , and walks in obedience to the teachings of God , which doth not answer your vain minds which are puffed up , so you cannot receive the pure language of truth , but rejects and scorns it and are angry , and if you be not bowed unto and spoken unto according to your customs then you are offended , and so you fret yourselves in the pride of your hearts , because we cannot answer your vain minds in your customs , fashions and traditions , and this is the great offence you take at us which provokes you to anger , and fills you with wrath and indignation against us , when we walk simply in the truth of God and do not give offence to any in the truth speaking , or in not moving or bowing to any man's person to have it in respect , for such things are out of truth , and where they are practised the leading of the spirit is not known , so you that are in those things you are in the vain customs of the heathen & follows your own wills , and satisfies your vain minds in your lust , which grieves the spirit of God , and we cannot own them , nor be conformable unto them , we dare not speak any other language but thou to a single person , knowing it is the spirits language , and hath been from the beginning , and the scripture declares of no other ; we cannot put off our hats and bow unto the persons of men , knowing that he who respects persons commits sin , and is convinced of the law to be a transgressor , and we know that when our hat is on our head , it is where it ought to be , being given for a covering unto that part , so we cannot move it , or put it off in honour to any man , but as our freedom is in God , for we have denied such things in obedience to God , and we cannot return again into them to be entangled with them , but stands in the freedom of God into which we are redeemed by his mighty power , and we see all these things to be vain which are practised in the world , and are not after the spirit but after the flesh , and from the heart which is deceitful and desperately wicked , and we cannot join with them , nor be conformable unto them for conscience sake , for we are set free by the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus , and we know them to be works of darkness , and so we testify against them , and we have the answer of a good conscience therein and peace with God , and in this we rejoice that we have not at any time suffered as evil doers , but for the testimony of a good conscience in simplicity and innocency in the sight of God who upholds us in his arm , and preserves us in his power from the wrath of unreasonable men ; so in faithfulness we stand approved to God , and is manifest to the measure of God in you all , and before the Lord we stand innocent , neither seeking nor striving after any thing but the glory of God and the good of all persons : and we do not deny any thing in the truth , therefore we are hated without cause , nor we cannot own any thing out of the truth , therefore our sufferings are not grievous to us , though we be kiled all the day long , and Counted as sheep for the slaughter , and the eyes of all are upon us for evil , yet we are preserved by an invisible power , and our hearts are enlarged and our tongues are unloosed , to magnify the god of our salvation : therefore take warning all persons and do not withstand truth any longer , nor proceed no further in your enmity against an innocent persons , for your folly will be made manifest if you go on in your way , and still continue the yoke and the burdens upon us , and have it in your hearts to spoil and persecute us who cannot for conscience sake submit to your customs , nor allow your practices which arises from your own inventions ; so from high to low consider , and what is past let it be sufficient , and let it not be in your hearts to proceed any further in your wills against the innocent , that God May divert his judgements which will certainly fall upon your heads if you go on in your wickedness , and there will be no escaping the fiery wrath of the almighty . Let this warning reach unto you and take place in you all ( Persons ) that you May dread before the Lord , and he that hath done wickedly do so no more , and who doth intend any evil towards us , let it not abide within you , but cast out your evil thoughts , and entertain them no longer , and let not your tongues be so perverse , but know the bridle for them that you May not speak unadvisedly as many have done , who have called light darkness and truth delusion , and so have reviled and scorned us who are by the light guided and in the truth walk , and let your moderation appear to all men that you May do unto others as you would have others to do unto you , for you make such measure as you would not have measured unto you again , so you are not come to the law and the prophets , therefore your way is not good nor to be proceeded in any further , but it is to be denied , and cast off and departed from ; so be stayed in time , and all mind the things that belong to your places , and let him that rules mind his place & rule with diligence , and make sweet & wholesome laws for the government of nations , that persons therein May be protected from injury , violence , or any wrong , and be ordered in peace , and dwell in safety every man in his place , and that sin May be cut down which does so much abound , and all evil doers restrained from their evil ways , and the well doers encouraged in their holy walking , that so true judgement and equity May abound in the nations , and truth and righteousness May run among the persons as a mighty stream , and let him that serves serve with carefulness , and mind his place , that he run not beyond his power , and so pervert the issuing forth of wholesome laws in their right course , and turn them into a corrupted channel ; therefore let him that serves be careful that he stretch not himself beyond his line as many in the servant's place do at this day , who act both beyond law , and contrary to the law , and so neither regards God nor man ; let this be all denied , and mind your-places in singleness , that you May perform them with carefulness as unto God , that both he that rules , and he that serves May be subject to the higher power which is of God , and know that to be over all powers , that none May enter into his work or meddle with those things that are too high for you , as many have done , who have busied themselves and spent much time but never could perfect any thing , but have been over turned and overwhelmed and none could be found to uphold them , and this is the work of the Lord , and the outstretched arm of his power that does all these things , who appears to be the salvation of a persons that trust in him , and to over-turn all those that conspire against them . How did he deliver Daniel out of the lion's den , and Mordecay and the scattered Jews from the wickedness intended against them , and Shedrack , Mesheck and Abednego out of the flames of the furnace , and from the wrath of Babylon's King ; and this is our god , on whom we wait and whom we serve and worship , and our eye is towards him , and our expectations from him , and his hand is not shortened towards us , neither doth he fail us , therefore our hearts are filled with joy , and our tongues with praises , and our spirits rest in hope , for God hath made his tabernacle with us , and dwells among us , and he is our god , and we are his persons in truth and righteousness . 

Oh ye dear children of light whom God hath gathered in this day of his compassion , and Counts you worthy to suffer for his name sake , rejoice and be glad , for great is your reward ; lift up your heads in the strength of the Lord , and walk in the power of his might , that you May be preserved by him in faithfulness to him , that the crown you May receive which no man can take from you ; oh let your souls rejoice in him , and all that is within you praise his holy name , for there is none like unto him who is over all gods , and over all Kings , sitting upon his throne and judging right ; let all bow before him and be subject to his power , that in peace we May lie down together , and in rest be established by the arm of his salvation for evermore . 

Oh thou holy righteous seed , thy day is come , thy day is come , thou holy one , thou art the lamb , thy day is come , and victory thou wilt obtain , thy power is known that makes us rejoice in thee , thou art the King of glory over all , we are subject unto thee , and with one accord we praise thy name , and our voice we lift up to thee ; thou hast redeemed us , and we are thine , and in thy love we are overcome to thee ; thou art the undefiled one , and what we are , we are in thee , thou art our life , and we live in thee ; thou glorious birth we have been thy star , and we worship thee , and present unto thee a living sacrifice of holy praises , everlasting glory and endless dominion for ever and ever . 

Oh ye ministers of England and nations afar off , your time now is , and is no more ; you are not upright before God , but are seeking yourselves , and are double-minded men ; you serve the times and not the Lord , and you turn amongst the changeable things , every man after his own way , having your time in your hand , so you can run with the times , and turn with the times , and what the times are , you are the same in show ; this is your own time , and now it is , behold it passeth away , and is no more , for God is dividing the times , and raising his own seed in his own time , which in your time you cannot comprehend ; how have you limited the holy one in your observing times , you have had your time so much in your own hand that you have forgotten the Lord whose power is unlimited , and his time unchangeable ; and you have brought forth your own inventions in your own time , and have set them up for doctrine and worship , and you have not regarded God's time which is in his own hand , so he is not to be found amongst you , nor in your time , but hath left you and departed from you , and you are become like a barren wilderness and a wild forest where briars and thorns grow ; and if any cannot observe your times , than you take hold like briars and tears them , and strikes like a thorn into their side ; and this is the spirit of presecution that reigns in you oh ye national ministry , there is sufficient witnesses against you who are oppressed by you in the prisons this day , into which you have caused them to be haled , and torn with your briars , and where you prick them with your thorns ; and is not this your work at this day ? When will you be weary of it you perverse men of corrupt minds who are after earthly things acting against God and his persons for filthy lucre sake ? And for this end you can be any thing in show , and turn with all times , that your gain from your quarter May be upheld to you , but the Lord is uncovering you to your shame for ever , though your time seem now to be , for the Lord is against you , and his controversy is with you , and all that strive to uphold you , and you must all fall together , and there shall be none to delivery on out of his hands ; and thus you have served the times thorough all the changings and turnings , and now you have it , but it is no more ; you sigh deep , and draw your breath from far , for that which is out of time is come to reign over you , and you are now striving for your life , not being willing to die ; what a time have you , and what a life do you live ? Consider it in the fear of God , and let your envy and malice cease towards those that cannot uphold the things in which your time and life is ; what is it you would do in your time ? Would you build your nests so high that the Lord May not see you ? Or would you enclose yourselves with cedars that he May not find you out ? Declare what is in your minds to the nations , that persons May be satisfied concerning you ; how do you manifest yourselves to be of the wicked one , who with a secret breath blows the coals until they kindle and break out into flames ; and all this hath been done in your own time , which makes you manifest to be of Cains race , and in the wolf's nature , for the day hath declared you , and nothing can cover you from the all-seeing eye of God , but your inward parts is opened , and an ill savour arises from you , and all your merchandise is become loathsome to the upright in heart , and they cannot buy them any more ; therefore behold where you are : and what is the place of your rest , for Babylon must be destroyed , and all her merchants must be spoilt , and you must not be spared who are found in the midst of her ; for the Lord God is strong that judgeth her , and he will dash all her brats against the stones , and burn her with fire , and you that favour her shall then mourn for her , and you that have taken up your rest in her lap , and partakes with her of her sins , you must partake of her plagues , and destruction will come upon you in one day , and a hiding place you will not find ; this is from the Lord God unto you , that you May come out of Babylon and trade no longer in her , nor drink no more of the wine of her fornication , nor do not cause others to drink of the cup of her abomination ; but all be still in your minds : and wait to know the measure of God in you , that the light of Christ which doth enlighten you May be your guide , that your eyes May be opened , and all your confusion discovered unto you , that you May see your way and come to repentance ; for you are not fit to be teachers of others while envy and malice remains in your hearts , and while you are time-servers , and men-pleasers , and loves your pleasures more than God ; you are not like Christ's ministers who knows the love of God in Christ shed abroad in their hearts , and in his love are constrained to serve him , and to deny all for him ; therefore come out of Babylon , and keep not persons any longer in her with your enchantments and sorceries with which you deceive , but come to the light of Christ with which you are enlightened , that his power you May know to crucify the proud nature in which you live , so will you come to a good understanding of the things that belongs to your peace , and know the Lord's time in his own hand , and his own arm that perfects his own work to his own praise , and do not strive against God , nor fret not yourselves when he appears , but walk like sober men , and let every man stand in his freedom that he hath in God , in which he answers a good conscience unto God , and be content with such maintenance as they are free to allow you , and give over forcing and compelling , suing and imprisoning those that are not of you , nor cannot join with you for conscience sake , for that is not the practice of Christ's ministers , neither is there any scripture on your side by which you can prove your practice warrantable , but it arises from the beast and the whore which gives life to the false prophet , who must all be taken alive , and cast into the lake , where the worm never dyes , nor the fire is not quenched , and their carcases shall be an abhorring to all flesh , and their time shall be no more . 

The end .
