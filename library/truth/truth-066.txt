The faithful witness . 

Give ear all ye inhabitants of the earth , for these sayings are true and faithful ; be meek and lowly in your hearts , and how your ears to wisdoms voice , and turn at her reproof ; for in your own ways are you wandering , where peace you know not ; the bowels of compassion is freely opened from the father's love , and his good will is made known amongst you , in that he is striving with you to turn you into the right way , that you Might walk therein ; for he hath not left himself without a witness in all your consciences , which doth not consent to your ungodly deeds , but doth convince you thereof , and bears testimony against your ways of vanity , which your minds are exercised in , and all your wicked practices which by you are brought forth from your vain minds , where you are beset with sin , and servants thereunto , your carnal minds being at enmity against God , and not subjected to his law , you are at liberty in the flesh ; and satisfying the lust thereof ; and though you all profess to know God , yet in works you deny him , and your hearts are far off from him , therefore is your worship vain ; for God's fear is not before your eyes ; therefore you run to do evil , and rebels more and more against the Lord , wallowing in the mire of defilements , that pollutes and stains your own consciences , your minds being in the earth , and your faces downward , thick clouds of darkness doth compass you about , and the Prince of darkness ruleth over you , and leads you all out of the way , where none doth good ; you are a cage of unclean birds , every one following the lust of his own heart , that you multiply your transgressions with delightings , and commits sin with greediness , and strengthens your hands in wickedness ; a sinful nation you are , and a seed of evil doers , filling up the measure of iniquity , and nourishing your hearts as in a day of slaughter ; from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet , there is no whole part in you . O! how long will you suffer the Lord to wait that he May show mercy to you ? How often have you rejected his loving kindness , and grieved his holy spirit ? What a day of a patience and forbearance hath he exercised towards you , that you Might have turned unto him , and received his mercy ? You are a stiff-necked persons , who sets yourselves against the Lord , and every visitation of his love , refusing to return , and hating to be reform ; for when you have been called by that of God in your own conscience , you have not harkened ; and when it hath smitten , you have refused correction ; have you not felt a witness in your own conscience against you , when you have been acting iniquity , & that it hath judged & condemned you for your secret faults , that fearfulness hath surprised you & paleness of face hath come upon you , when no man hath been near you , nor no tongue accused you , yet that hath been within that hath numbered up your transgressions , & set your sins in order before you , and brought them all to light in your own conscience , which the eye of man hath not seen , nor for which the tongue of man could accuse you ; yet they have appeared fresh in your minds , though many years before they had been committed by you : oh consider what it is all you that have so long outstood it , and yield obedience to the reproof of it , that you May be acquainted with it , and thereby know it to be God's faithful witness in your own conscience placed against sin , and the hand of love reached forth to lead you out of sin , and so come to have communion with it , and walk in the light of it , that you May not fall under the eternal condemnation thereof ; for though it be as a sign , everywhere spoken against by those who are at enmity with it , and that they call i••atural , and a delusion ; yet if you turn at the reproof the of , and yield obedience to it , you will know it to be God •ighty power unto salvation ; and this will give you the e•••ence in yourselves , that it is a manifestation of God which doth discover all that in you which is contrary to its own property , which it hath no fellowship nor communion with ; and this can neither be natural nor a delusion , which doth reprove the natural man in his natural state , where he is an enemy to God , a fervant to sin , and under the devil's power , by whom he is tempted and deluded to consent to the motion of sin , and to bring forth the works of iniquity , which the faithful witness doth not consent to , but testifies against , and shows it to be evil in the conscience of every man , and reproveth thereof , and calls every man to separate from it as an unclean thing ; this you May all read in yourselves , in the light which you are enlightened withal : yea drunkards , swearers , liars , and all profane persons , you all have a manifestation of God in you , which doth discover your sins unto you , and brings them unto your remembrance , and many times strikes you with fear and terror for the evil of your doings , and brings you into sadness and mourning for your sins past , which in the light is made manifest unto you in your own conscience ; and this is not a natural thing , nor a delusion , but it is Christ the light of the world , who was before the world was , and is the power of God made manifest to destroy sin , and the devil's works ; and this is he unto whom you are all to look , and stand obedient unto whatsoever he doth command you , that you May know salvation in him , and redemption by him whose hand of love is reached forth in this his day of power , that a willingness he Might beget in you to follow him , & be guided by the hand of love out of darkness , where the god of this world ruleth , who is a deceiver , unto whose delusions many are given up , and do believe his lies , in which they oppose the truth , and are at open enmity with it , being silled with wrath and envy against it : now such whose deeds are evil , loves not the light , neither will come to it , but runs from it , and speaks despitefully of it , as the Pharisees did of him who is the son of God ; and though mighty signs and wonders he did amongst them , making the blind to see , and the dumb to speak , yet were they filled with envy against him , and said he cast out devils by Beelzebub the Prince of devils , but he knowing their thoughts ▪ said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself , is brought to desolation ; and if Satan cast ••t Satan , he is divided against himself , how shall then his kingdom stand ? But if i cast out devils by the spirit of God , than the kingdom of God is come unto you ; this you May read matth. 12.  And here you May read whose offspring you are ; for this scripture is fulfilled this day upon this ungodly generation , though your eyes be blinded that you see it not ; therefore repent , and be converted , that the hand of love May lead you , and that your sins May be blotted out ; for with a light of Christ are you all enlightened , that doth discover your secrets parts , and makes manifest the counsels of all your hearts , and is the true light that lighteth every man that comes into the world , ioh. 1. 9  This is plain scripture , and you say you believe the scripture ; but you say again , this scripture doth not speak of a light within ; then weigh it wisely , and see how every man that comes into the world is enlightened , and by it you May read 2 cor. 4. 6.  For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ : this is plain scripture , and this was the apostles testimony , that the light shone in the heart , ( that 's within persons ) and there gave them the light of the knowledge of God's glory : but than you say , these were believers , and you grant that believers have a light of Christ in them , but not persons in their natural state ; the apostle was once in the natural state , and was a persecutor of those that did believe in the light , yet was the light in him , shining in the darkness , but the darkness comprehended it not ; but when it came to shine round him , and convince him that he was an enemy to it , and kicking against it , he bowed before it , and submitted unto it , and yielded ready obedience , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? then did it shine forth of darkness , and did shine in the heart , in which the knowledge of God's glory was made manifest ; read this in God's pure fear , and consider if you be not where the apostles once were , and there stands in open rebellion against that which he came to believe in , and bear his testimony unto ; and further witnessed , that a persons who held the truth in unrighteousness , had a manifestation of God in them , rom. 1. 19  Because that which May be known of God is manifest in them , for God hath showed it unto them : here was a persons who was not in the faith , and yet that which Might be known of God , was manifest in them , and whatsoever doth make manifest , is light , eph. 5. 13. than the light was within them , and the truth was within them , but they did not believe in it , but changed it into a lie , ver. 25. and did not like to retain God in their knowledge , ver. 28.  Therefore unto vile affection did God give them up , that they Might believe lies , because they received not truth in the love of it ; this is a witness which none of you can fly from ; whithersoever you go , it will ••nd you out ; contend no longer against it , for in it doth the grace of God appear to all men , by which the love of God comes to be felt in all that do obey and submits to the teachings of it ; and though there be many in the unbelief , that speaks unadvisedly of it , neither knowing what they say , nor whereof they affirm , who calls it a natural light , and delusion ; yet in that love which unto me is freely opened , and through the grace which i have received in it , i am constrained to bear my testimony , and to declare unto all persons , that the light of Christ with which every man is enlightened , is the mighty power of God unto salvation to every one that do believe in it , and a living witness in every man's conscience is placed , to condemn the workers of iniquity , who hath not a love to it , because their deeds are evil ; there is no escaping of it , for it is quick and powerful , searching , trying & proving all secrets , and the counsels of all hearts are naked and bare before it : read this soberly , for it is written plainly in the love of God , who is rich in mercy , and plenteous in goodness and truth , whose bowels of compassion moveth in pity towards a sinful generation , who hath no pleasure that any of you should die ; therefore in this his day doth he reach forth a hand of love to lead and guide out of darkness all that turn unto it , and are made willing to be guided by it . Now all prove yourselves in the light which you are enlightened withal , and examine yourselves truly , and see if you cannot witness this testimony to be faithful and true , and feel the testimony of the spirit bearing witness in your inward parts , unto what is here declared ; for unto that of God in all consciences i am manifest , which doth not consent to your sins , but is separate from sin , and made manifest to take away •in , who is the lamb of God , pure and undefiled , and though you have a general talk amongst you of faith in Christ , and living by faith upon him , and that he is your saviour and redeemer , yet you work iniquity daily , and pleads for sin term of life , and neither knows salvation nor redemption in him , who is the son of God's love : therefore be not deceived with a vain hope , and groundless faith , which stands only in words , when your works denies your faith to be living , being yet in your sins , for the lusts of the flesh you do fulfil , and draws iniquity with cords of vanity ; look inward , the light will not deceive you , but manifest every secret sin which lodgeth in your hearts , which you would keep hidden to have your life in ; for though you May not be committing all sin so greedily as May stand with your hearts against many things which May be commonly Counted profane , yet examine if you have not something secretly lodged , which your minds are captivated in , and which the light of Christ in your consciences doth reprove you for ; there is your lover ; and that must be cast out , and trodden under foot , if ever you come to witness redemption by Christ . Some men are not common drunkards , as the world calls them , yet secretly hath a love to be in the excess , some in neither of these , yet hath another lover ; so some in pride , some in covetousness , some in foolish jesting , and idle talking , some in vain sports and pleasures of the world , that so you are all found to have some secret lover which you would not have tried in the light ; now there is nothing so secret which shall not come to light , though long you May hide it , and smothe• the witness of God in your own conscience , that testifies against it ; yet to the light must every secret thing come , whether it be good or evil , and in the light be tried and judged in righteous judgement . Therefore all unto the light give up yourselves , and yield obedience to every motion thereof in your own consciences , that you May become followers of it , in love to it ; for if you stand in the enmity against it , and be more in love with your evil deeds than you are with the light , there will be no escaping the condemnation of it ; therefore let this be a warning unto you all who live in pleasures upon the earth , that you May cease to do evil , and depart from your iniquities , and break off from your sins , before the time come in which you will say , there is no pleasure in them . 

Oh hearken ! hearken ! for this is the day of your visitation , now is the accepted time ; now is God's witness striving with you ; now is the hand of love reached forth unto you ; therefore whilst it is called to day , harden not your hearts , but turn unto the Lord who stands ready to have mercy upon you , for therein doth he delight : now let not your hearts be hardened to outstand this day of visitation , left the day of vengeance and indignation come upon you , and overtake you , because mercy you have refused . Consider this all you who have your life in pride , covetousness , drunkenness , swearing , lying , envy and malice , and vanities of the world , if these things be not showed you to be evil by something in your own conscience that doth convince you of them , and reprove you for them , and brings you to an understanding that you ought not to do them ; this is the light of Christ which is pure , and hath no communion with darkness , nor the unfruitful works thereof , but is separated from the unclean , neither joining with it , nor consenting to it , but hath a life in itself which is holy and undefiled , and doth pursue the evil-doer in judgement , who is at enmity with it , and in disobedience to it . Oh sink down in God's fear , and consider what a day of patience and forbearance he hath continue unto you ; how long hath he spared you ? And what a time of repentance hath he given you ? And how many years hath he striven with you , that with the cords of love he Might have drawn you , and with the hand of love have led you ? But you have rejected it , and casts love behind your backs , and likes to retain your evil deeds better , and to love darkness rather : what visitations of God's pure love have you set at naught , that you Might walk after the way of your own hearts , & the lust of your own eyes , rising up in rebellion against the pure witness of God in your own conscience , and •laying it , that you Might live in pleasures , and walk at liberty in the flesh , without reproof : and thus is the just condemned and killed by you , and he resists not ; he is rejected and despised by you , wounding him by your transgressions , and bruising him with your iniquities , yet doth not he open his mouth , but as a lamb is he led to the slaughter ; oh look up unto him whom you pierce , and mourn , let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your joy into heaviness ; for he doth not so deal with you , but suffers and bears in patience , and in the bowels of pity is yet striving with you , that his goodness Might lead you to repentance ; and thus doth he love his enemies , and doth good to those that hates him : therefore all bow your ears , and hearken , and be diligent to obey the light before it cease striving with you , and the long-suffering of the Lord come to an end concerning you , and his tender love be shut up from you , who have gainsaid and outstood the day of your visitation , and then you begin to knock like foolish virgins , when the doors is shut , and all things quiet , and to seek a place of repentance when it cannot be found , though you seek it with tears . 

Oh prize the day of your visitation ; and let all vain disputers of this world lay their hands upon their mouths , and confess they have done foolishly in contending and striving in their own wills against that which hath so long striven with them , that they Might be turned from the darkness unto the light , and from the power of Satan unto God , tha• the hand of love Might guide them to receive the grace of God which so freely he hath made manifest unto them : read you priests , professors , and all persons ; who hates the light , and will not •bide to hear of it so near you , as in your own conscience , but are filled with rage and fury against it , speaking scornfully , proudly , and disdainfully of it , and hast that are guided by it ; in this you are all friends ; and joins together ; fear and tremble before the living God , for his wrath is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodliness of men ; and a day of sad lamentation is kindling from the breath of the almighty , and will fall upon the heads of the ungodly• who in their stout-heartedness outstand the day of God's loving kindness ; this testimony will reach you all , and that of God in your conscience answers to it ; give all diligence thereunto , for it is a sure word , and teacheth right things ; it will not deceive you if you incline your m••dss unto it , that you May be doers of what it teacheth ; for it is God's grace that appeareth , and if you yield obedience to it , you will know it brings salvation with it , and will teach you to deny the ungodliness and worldly lusts , in which the Prince of darkness leads you , and deceives you , and brings forth his work by you in all manner of sin and wickedness , in which you are serving him , and in which your minds are captivated by him ; and the light of Christ in your conscience hath no communion with such works of darkness , but stands a witness against them , and reproves you for them , as you join unto them : and this is the word of his grace , that would have you to deny them , and forsake them , and to live soberly , righteously , and godly in this present evil world ; for the fashions of this world passeth away , and all your vanities will wither , and your beauty consume , and the later end will come upon you , when the Lord will have no pleasure in you , but will give you your portion with hypocrites ; consider all you vain persons of the world , who live in rioting and drunkenness , chambering and wantonness , strife and envying , what will you do ? And what account will you make unto the righteous God , who is judge of all the earth , and will re•ard every man according to his deeds ? Run not so headily in the exercise of wickedness , but stand still , and hearken to the still voice in your conscience , which tells you that is not the way ; for death and destruction is before you , and the pit is near unto you , and many of you are come to the brink thereof ; be stayed in time , before you fall therein , from whence there will be no recovery ; and let the time past of your lives suffice that you have spent , and lived so many years together in the lusts of the flesh , against the light and love of God . Therefore all in God's fear stand , and feel it placed in your hearts , that from iniquity you May depart , and •in no more , but all come into obedience to that of God in you , which makes •in manifest , and there God's power know , to sanctify and cleanse you by the washing of water through the word , that a new life you May come into , and walk in the regeneration ; he that hath an ear to hear , let him hear ; for the love of Christ constraineth me to bear testimony of what is made manifest unto me in the light , that you May all come to the knowledge of the truth , and be saved ; and likewise knowing the terror of the Lord , i cannot but persuade men to depart from the evil of their ways , which the wrath of the Lord is revealed against , and that you May all come to know that the long-suffering of the Lord is salvation , and that his saving-strength is near at hand , to help in the needful time ; and here you will find power to preserve you from the temptations which the enemy casts in , and then labours to draw your minds to join unto ; for as obedience is given unto the light , power is received that destroys the devil's work , and weakens his kingdom ; and than the hand of love is reached forth to take hold of you , and to lead you out of darkness , and from under his government , into the new and living way , and there gently guides you , and order• you , and keeps you from all the assaults which the enemy doth pursue withal ; and he who hath life in himself , will give life unto you , and make you able to stand and •ight the good fight of faith ; and here the divine nature is felt , and the glory of the only begotten of the father is beheld : and this is the testimony of the faithful witness , which from the father's love is made manifest in the conscience of every man , that you Might believe in it , and know the saving-strength of it , working redemption for you , and putting an end to sin , and overturning the powers of darkness , and bringing in everlasting righteousness ; and this is the hand of love reached forth unto you all , to lead you out of the house of bondag• , into the glorious liberty of the •onss of God ; where your understandings will be opened to know the scriptures , and the power of God ; for as you give obedience to the reachings of the spirit , so will the things of God be made known unto you , and no man can know the things of God by any e•her way , either by art , study , learning , or any industry of the natural part , but as the spirit of God makes them known in the children of obedience , who give up themselves to the teachings of it , and by it are guided to know the scriptures fulfilled in themselves ; & this will bring you to a right understanding of the scriptures , as you receive the same spirit of faith , and walks in it , as they received and walked in , by whom the scriptures were declared ; for he that was then light , life and power unto all that did believe in him , and gave them an understanding to know the things that were true ; he is the same now , and changeth not ; but wicked men have changed his glory into shame , and minds earthly things ; yet is his light , life , and power the same unto all that believe , and comes to have the spirit of their minds renewed by him , and so the scripture is truly owned and witnessed , being fulfilled in all that walk after the spirit , and have the spirit of their minds renewed by it , as they had who hath declared it in words , which are written : and so the same spirit guiding , brings into unity with the same words , which was given forth from its own movings in the hearts of those who by it was constrained to declare them ; and thus the children of obedience owns the scriptures , and hath unity with them in the same : spirit that gave them forth , & knows them fulfilled in themselves , walking after the same spirit . Let this be well weighed by you who are wise in your own eyes , & prudent in your own sight , and in that wisdom talks so much of what is written , and gets the words thereof , and with them contend in your wills , and fights against the Lord , and every appearance of righteousness , brought forth in the motion of the spirit , which is the mystery hide from your eyes , and revealed unto the babes , who walk in the light which reveals secrets , and makes them to be of understanding hearts , to know the true God , and eternal life ; and here is the door of hope for all you tender ones , who are breathing after God ; come , walk in the light that an entrance you May feel ministered unto you , and •n enjoyment of the possession of that which in the door of hope is opened for you , where the rivers of God's good pleasure runneth freely , with which he doth satisfy the poor of the flock , who waits to be refreshed thereby , which he doth renew their strength in , to follow him in the narrow way , in which flesh and blood cannot walk , nor no unclean thing must enter ; therefore do not you hew broken cisterns , nor feed upon husks any longer , but to the streams of life all come , and feel how good the Lord is ; so all wait to know the hand of love to lead you , and the spirit of truth to teach you , which will not deceive you , but teach you right things ; though such who are at enmity with it , speak unadvisedly of it , yet it is truth in itself , and abides the same for ever , and will overturn all who in the height of envy and fury do pursue it with swelling words of vanity . 

Therefore let all things be tried and proved in the light , and in it search yourselves , that you May come to the bottom , and have all the dross purged out , and the tin taken away , that your hearts May be purified in the light , that so you May stand approved in the sight of the pure God : and here is the right way of the Lord opened , and a hand of love reached forth to guide you out of all crooked paths , and to bring you into the way of righteousness , truth , and holiness , and bring you to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled , where joy unspeakable is possessed : and this honour hath all the saints , who are found faithful before the Lord , to follow the lamb whither soever he goes . 

Therefore let this testimony come unto you who have had some openings of God's love , and have felt the gift of grace made manifest in your conscience , that hath convinced you of many things , and brought you to forsake much of the world's fashions , and customs , and worship , and have brought you to a separation from it , that you are not so openly profane as many of them are , but are turned from many appearances of evil , which the light did truly make manifest in you , and convince you of in your own conscience ; and a simplicity there was begotten in you , that truth was precious unto you , and a love you had unto it , and came to have a sight of many things afar off , and a desire in you to press after the enjoyment of them ; and by the light you were guided out of many things which it did convince you of to be evil ; and you could not any longer continue therein , because they were made manifest unto you to be works of darkness . Deal truly with your own hearts all of you , for there is nothing secret which shall not come to light ; and you cannot deny but that it was something of God in your own conscience that made sin manifest , and convinced you thereof , and moved in your hearts to draw you from it , and made discoveries of secret things , which in your hearts were lodged , and showed you the world's ways and worship to be against the truth , and did convince you thereof , and brought you to separate from it in appearance . And •ere was pure breathings in you which longed for God , that you Might come into his court , and enjoy his presence ; oh this was a simple and innocent state , in which you were precious in God's sight ; and whilst you did abide faithful , waiting in patience for God's loving kindness , therein to grow up into the measure of Christ's fullness ; the Lord was not wanting to you , but was large in his love , and free in his mercy , as in obedience you walked to the measure of the gift of grace ; and your prayers and tears came up before him , and was had in remembrance by him : oh what breathings , pantings , and hungerings hath there been in many of you after the Lord , with strong cries and tears , for a visitation of his love ; and that you Might walk in the light of his countenance ! How zealous & fervent have you been after righteousness , & to follow the motion of the spirit of life with cheerfulness ! Have you not cried down forms , and set up the spirit's worship , and its teachings ? And hath not the spirit judged you in your own conscience , when you have not obeyed it ? And have you not been brought to stoop down , & lie low under the sense of judgement , & that you could not find a resting place , but still that of God in your own conscience pursued you whithersoever you went , you could not leave it in any place ; but near you it did appear , witnessing against you , and judging you for your disobedience ? Can you not witness these things to be true , many of you ? and that this hath been your condition , going heavily and mournfully under God's displeasure made manifest against you ? And hath not your anguish and trouble been within you , which hath brought you into meekness and lowliness , and beaten you down in yourselves , that you have confessed your own nothingnes• and insufficiency , and here hath been brought to wait on the Lord alone in simplicity , that his saving-strength you Might feel to help you ? And did not you find him to be a God near at hand when your eye was towards him , and your expectations from him ? Did he not open his love freely , and gave you savoury refreshment and comfort , and made bare his own arm to help you , & wrought all your works in you , and for you , that you have even admiredd his goodness , and acknowledged his power in his free gift and grace unto you ? and whilst the simpli•ity did abide in you , and you was faithful to what was made manifest unto you ? What pure breathings had many of you after a greater measure of the gift of grace , and that the Lord would pour forth more of his spirit upon you , that you Might be made fruitful , and grow up to the Lord in it ; and here you had precious discoveries , as you stood in obedience to the measure of God's spirit , thereby to be guided , and so separated from the world's form , in obedience to the light of Christ in your own conscience , and that it did constrain you to depart , having made known unto you something more excellent , which was above the world's worship , and which you found to be your duty to walk np unto , that you Might come into liberty , and to serve God in the spirit ; and here you stood in God's fear , and assembled together to wait for the spirits moving , that it Might teach you to speak , and teach you to pray , and that all your duties Might be offered up , and performed in the spirit ; hath not this been declared by many of you , from what you have truly felt of God's loving kindness made manifest in you , which brought you to deny , & testify against many things which you were convinced of to be evil ? but you have forsaken your first love , and have not been faithful to the end ; therefore the Lord hath somewhat against you , because you uphold that woman Jezzabel , and suffers her to teach and seduce , by whom many are overcome , to commit fornication with her ; for the true guide you have lost , which once did lead you in the way , and would have brought you to the true rest , had you kept your minds stayed in it , and walked in obedience to it ; but the enemy hath deceived you , and prevailed over you , and drawn you into crooked paths , where you are got into the earth again ; for the simplicity is betrayed , and your desires are cooled ; and your breathings and pantings after God are stayed , and you are set down in a form which once you were convinced of to be dead and barren : let not this offend you , for it is the truth concerning many of you , and the witness of God in your conscience doth answer to it . Therefore remember from whence you are fallen , and repent , for the •ord would not have you perish , but still reacheth forth a hand of love unto you , having more pleasure to save then to destroy ; therefore is he still striving with you , and gives you no rest nor peace in the way which the god of this world hath led you into , and blinds your minds in ; for your actions witness against you daily , that you are servants to sin , and that liberty you speak of , and saith you are redeemed unto , is but an occasion for you to serve the lusts of the flesh , which makes you one with the world again in words and practices , where the enemy hath taken you captive , and leads you in earthly pleasures , and covetous practices , in which you are wanton and light-minded , in foolish jesting , and vain talking , turning the grace of God into wantonness , and making shipwreck of faith and a good conscience , being heightened in your imaginations in what you have taken up in the observation , in which Satan hath transformed himself by his deceitful working , in bringing forth a form in the imitation , where you are set down , and have taken up your rest ; and here he hath deceived you with a vain hope , having settled you in a form without power , and doth work a persuasion in your minds , that it is the right way , and so sets you in enmity against the pure motion of the light of Christ in you , having got your minds out , to look abroad , and have your expectation from something that is without , and so he hath drawn your minds from that which is within , that once did truly move in you , and would have brought you into the power , had you been faithful to the end ; but you are fallen short of that which they witnessed , whose practice you pretend to follow , and are turned against it , and become the greatest enemies unto it ; for he that hath prevailed over you , and betrayed the simplicity in you , seeks to pervert the right way of the Lord by you , and fills you with fury to cry out against those that walk in uprightness of their hearts before the Lord , and in his fear are kept , that they dare not sin against him , but walks in righteousness and holiness , in which the light leadeth them , and which by his grace he teacheth them , from which you are erred and gone astray , and walks after the imaginations of your own hearts , where your own wills leads you , to take up a practice in imitation of what others have done , who was by the spirit of truth guided , and by it commanded , and in which they performed all their services ; but unto this spirit you are found enemies , and fighting against it in the strength of your own wisdoms , and so runs into error , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God , but denies that which gives the understanding to know them , and so never comes to the fulfilling of them , nor to have unity with them , but as they are words declared and recorded ; for you stand not in obedience to the same spirit , that in the inner man it Might teach you , and lead you to the Lord God , who hath life in himself , and gives life unto all that come unto him , and believes in him , by which all the children of obedience are refreshed and satisfied , who lives by faith , looking for , and waiting to receive those things which are not seen ; but that which you take up your rest in , and are satisfied with , is visible and temporal , which is seen , and beheld with natural eyes ; and so you miss that which is spiritual , and cannot be seen , which is the substance , and the end of all changeable things , not living by faith , but by sight , and contents yourselves with create refreshments ; but that which the soul hungereth after , and panteth for , is living bread that comes down from heaven , which whoso eats , shall never die : for it is the bread of life , whose flesh is meat indeed , and whose blood is drink indeed ! Oh pure refreshment from the Lord's presence ! Blessed are all that are found worthy to sit down at this table , and to partake of this bread , and drink of this cup , which is the communion of Christ's blood . 

Be ye of an understanding heart , oh ye professors , and consider if you have the substance , and that you live in Christ , and he in you ; and that you feel those things you feed upon to have life in themselves , and to give life unto you ; if life be not in your bread and wine , they are not the communion of Christ's body , nor blood , but bare bread and wine , retaining their own quality and virtue , as create refreshments ; and if you say this was their practice who enjoyed Christ , and fed upon him , and that the bread which they broke was the communion of Christ's body , and the cup which they drank was the communion of Christ's blood ; but i say , examine yourselves whether you be in the faith , least you eat and drink damnation to yourselves , not discerning the Lord's body ; for that which they received , and had communion in , who lived by faith , was not bread of grain , nor wine in a silver cup ; but the bread which they broke was the communion of Christ's body , and the cup which they drank , was the communion of Christ's blood ; and you cannot prove any other thing without inventions ; and they being many , was one bread , and one body ; but the mystery is hide from your eyes , who in your earthly wisdom would comprehend the things of God ; for you being run from the guide which once did give you light , and for a season you rejoiced in it , you are departed from that which would have given you a true discerning of the lo•ds' body , & wrought faith in you to have believed , though you had not seen ; and if you had been obedient to have followed that of God which once did truly move in you , than you would have continue in the holy commandments given of God , and have walked in them as children of obedience , and discerned the Lord's body , and the communion which they had in it , who did eat and drink , and fed upon it in their hearts by faith ; and this was the bread which they did eat , and the cup which they drank , and had their life in him who is the bread of life , whose examples none can follow in truth , but such as receive the same spirit of faith , and walks in obedience to it , which you are found fighting against with the words which from it were declared , which you say is more sure than it is in its movings : what a veil hath overspread you ! And what thick darkness hath covered you who denies the motion of the spirit from which the scriptures were declared ! Did not holy men of God speak as they were moved by the holy ghost ? Did it not first move within them , and gave them a divine inspiration , by which they came to know the things of God made manifest in them , and from the motion of the spirit declared as it gave them utterance ; and so the scriptures came to be given forth , and a true record it is of what they were made witnesses of , who had communion with the spirit , and tasted of the word of life ? and the scriptures are profitable where the manifestation of the spirit is received , and believed in , by which the understanding is opened to know them , and the power of God , but not to set them above Christ , not against him , as you are doing , who are yourselves departed from him , and yet uses your tongues to speak the words which were declared from the motion of the spirit , and sets them in opposition to the same light and spirit which now as truly moveth in the children of obedience , as it did in them who were made witnesses of the grace of God , and through the operation of the spirit did declare it . 

Therefore be not so rash in your minds , as to call good evil , and truth a delusion ; but sink down in God's fear , and know that which is near you , to reprove you in your ignorance , and then you will know there is nothing so sure as that which was before the world , or man , or scriptures were , which is that which changeth not , but is to day as yesterday , and abides the same for ever . 

And this is the everlasting truth which from the beginning hath been made manifest through ages and generations , according to the dispensation of God's good pleasure , which all the holy men of God have walked in , and been obedient to , and declared of , whose sayings are all true and faithful , and are owned to be a true declaration of the living word which from the beginning was , & now is , which changeth not , in which they felt God's loving kindness made manifest unto them , as they walked in obedience unto him ; and likewise declared of God's severity and displeasure revealed against the ungodly and unbelievers ; and thus was the truth known from the beginning , to instruct , and lead , and guide the righteous in the holy way , wherein they erred not , and to convince and condemn the world for sin , who walked with a froward heart against the Lord : be not deceived , for all visible things must perish , and that which hath a beginning , hath an end ; howsoever it May appear in show unto you , there will be no help found in any create being in the needful time ; for your foundation which in your own wisdom you have laid , and in your own strength you are building upon , one tempest will beat it all down , and your labour will be lost after so many years spent . 

Therefore be meek and lowly in your hearts , and •ink down to the cornerstone , and reject it no longer , for it will not fail , neither can the gates of hell prevail against it : all wait for the hand of love to bring you thither , that there your footsteps May be placed , and your goings ordered , that a spiritual house you May know raised up by the arm of the Lord ; and here Christ is known , who is true for evermore , and leads into all truth those that believe in him , and are guided by him ; the alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , the first and the last ; there is none besides him , nor any to be compared into him , who baptizeth all that believe in him into one body , by one spirit , and there cleanseth them by the washing of water through the word , where the regeneration comes to be witnessed , and the answer of a good conscience received , the pure water flowing forth which washeth and cleanseth the body inwardly , by which believers comes to be baptised into Christ , and puts him on ; and this is the one baptism , known and witnessed by all that follow the light of the Lord , and walks in obedience to his commands : and if you do not wilfully outstand God's witness , you cannot but confess this is the baptism in which believers are baptised , and is the one baptism the scriptures declares of , and that there is not another to be continue . 

Therefore be silent before the Lord , and yield obedience to what he commands you by his spirit in the inner man , and there know that one baptism which all believers are baptised with , in which they are washed and cleansed , to follow Christ in the regeneration and newness of life ; he that can receive it , let him : for you cannot prove by plain scripture that Christ was a minister of water baptism , or that he did command it , or preached it for doctrine , or pressed it as a duty ; but he sent his disciple forth to preach the gospel of the kingdom , and to give that which they had received freely ; and you cannot prove that when they were thus sent forth , that they had received water-baptism ; but what was made manifest in them , and which they had received , that they gave , and declared thereof in God's power ; and this reached the inward parts , and pricked the hearts of those that heard it , and brought them to inquire what they Might do ; unto whom Peter said , repent , and be baptised every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ , for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost , Acts 2. 38.  This day is this scripture fulfilled , praises be unto the Lord God for ever ; and many are true witnesses of this baptism , whose hearts have been pricked by the eternal living word in their own conscience , that they have been brought to inquire what they Might do ; and the living word hath been obeyed , and the reproof thereof , which hath wrought the godly sorrow unto repentance , never to be repent of ; and there the fountain hath been opened , which washeth away sin and uncleanness , and baptizeth into the name of Jesus Christ , where sins are remitted , and the gift of the holy ghost received : and in this scripture water is not once named , where the apostle preaches the doctrine of baptism , and was the first which was preached after the holy ghost fell upon them . 

Therefore be not so envious against those who witness the truth as they know it in Jesus , and are baptised with the holy ghost and fire , and hath felt him whose fan is in his hand , thoroughly purging his floor , and cleansing the inward parts from all unrighteousness ; and this licks up the water , and consumes it , as the fire did which fell from Elijah's altar , which was a true figure of the two ministrations , if you could read it ; for had you obeyed that which once did truly move in you , and opened God's love unto you , and gave you a sight of many things which in your hearts were secretly lodged , and let you see the ways and worship of the world to be vain ; if you had continue faithful unto this pure guide , it would not have left you on Jordan's brinks , nor in the midst thereof , but would have opened it unto you , and led you thorough it , and over it , and given you an inheritance in the true rest for ever . 

Therefore be awakened , and lift up your eyes , and behold where you are ; for you are not come where •ongs of deliverance are sung , but are set down short of the pure rejoicing , from whence you are all called to arise , and join to the hand of love which is still reached forth unto you , that thereby you Might be gnided in the way of peace that leadeth to eternal life ; and though many of you May swell in wrath because the little stone is smiting your image , and that you know not how to uphold it but by contending for it , and talking of the scriptures , yet this will not uphold it , nor your worship and obedience to it ; for the witness is true , and the testimony thereof doth stand against you , and over it you cannot prevail ; and this is my rejoicing in it , that i have the answer of a good conscience , and peace with God ; & though many of you May be hardened , and set yourselves against the word of truth , and hates to be reform by it ; yet truth is the same , and you cannot change it with all your inventions . 

And let all the simple-minded who are yet seeking rest , and are not satisfied with what you are feeding upon , oh return unto the Lord , and come again to that of God in you , who will heal your backslidings , and open your understandings , where the right way of the Lord will be made known unto you ; for it is man that doth deceive you , and leads you in many ways that they have imagined ; and in their wills sets up their own inventions for the way of God , when the Lord hath not required it at their hands ; and whilst you are 〈◊〉 bewitched with the enchanters and soothsayers , and 〈◊〉 your delight in their crooked paths , you will not find that wherein satisfaction is , which some of you are truly se•-king after : therefore unto you is this moved from the living God , who are tender hearted , and in whom there is yet a true breathing after God , who cannot be satisfied with those things that will perish , but are seeking after the enjoyment of something that will abide ; hearken to the light of Christ and feel the hand of love , and join yourselves unto it , that you May be acquainted with it , and know the leadings of it ; this will bring you to the life from whence it comes , as you yield obedience to it , there will you feel living springs opened freely to you , and plentifully to refresh you , where you will know the water that faileth not , which yieldeth satisfaction and pure refreshment ; and though many be set down with their hearts hardened , and denies every motion of the spirit in them , and instead of being filled with the spirit according to the apostles doctrine , they are filled with envy and fury against it , and every appearance of it , and opens their mouths in blasphemy against it ; but they shall all know a day of trial , in which a recompense of reward will be given from the righteous God , who will bring every secret thing into judgement , and make all his enemies his footstool ; let not their hard heartedness be an occasion to make your tender hearts stumble at the way of truth ; neither give your minds to hearken to their enchantments , who hath so long bewitched you from obeying the truth ; but all be diligent to hearken to the light which is truly moving in many of you , and doth couvince you that you are not walking in the right way , you see something amiss amongst you , which you cannot have communion with , and something which you are not come to live in , and which you cannot deny but to be truth as it is brought forth from the spirit of truth in others . 

Therefore do you weigh and consider wisely where you are , that you May be no longer deceived , but May come and know the right way of the Lord . So all in the light keep your minds stayed , and hasten not , but lie down and patiently wait , that you May see salvation brought unto you , as you are brought to stand still ; and so will the Lord work his own work for you , by the arm of his power , and make known his secrets , and reveal his son in you , that you May not confer with flesh and blood . 

So unto the light of Christ with which you are enlightened , all give up yourselves in obedience , that every motion thereof you May be willing to follow , that it May be your leader , & guide you out of your own ways , and words , and works , and thoughts , and bring you into subjection , to do the father's will in all things , and to obey his teachings which by his spirit he requireth , and it will bring you to know truth in the inner parts , which the Lord loveth ; and as you obey the light , and follows it , you will feel every motion thereof to be precious , and bringing you nearer unto the life from whence it comes , where the pure openings of God's love you will feel to satisfy you . 

So all in God's fear stand , and sink down to the cornerstone which in you is placed , and know that to be your foundation , and this will be a sure way to come to Christ , when you feel his virtue to stay your issue ; and this is the grace of God that brings salvation , and appeareth to all men , & teacheth what to deny , and what to walk in , which if you take heed unto , you will need no other teacher , but as the anointing teacheth you , which is in you , and is truth , and no lie , which will open your understandings to know the things of God , and let you see things that differ , and bring you to a true discerning betwixt the precious and the vile , where man's way and God's way will be plainly opened unto you ; for the seeds sake this is declared : reject not counsel ye tender hearts , but be willing to receive instruction , that your minds May be informed where to wait for God's loving kindness , that the hand of love May lead you in the new and living way that brings to the father , where the true rest you will find , and perfect peace . 

Truth defended and cleared from the lies and slanders declared by Jonathan Johnson . 

Having observed the envious spirit to rage for a long season in Jonathan Johnson against the truth as it hath been declared and published in the motion of the spirit of life , and that as books hath come to his hand which hath been so published , he hath been set on work in his busy mind to write in the leaves thereof against the truth which hath been therein declared ; for which cause i , having unity through the love of God with that truth so declared , and being made a witness thereof , it was laid upon me as my duty to write unto him , and declare against his secret working , in which i offered this unto him in the fear of the Lord , that he would set out his own work , and make it public in print , and also sent him some queries for to answer publicly , and thereby did let him know that i should not receive him upon any other account , but as he made his work public , having heard much of his contentious spirit ; unto which offer and queries , he sent me a plain denial in writing back again , in which were many words and false accusations against the truth , which i did not find my duty to reply to in writing , having before let him know that i should not receive him upon that account ; therefore my duty was now to let him know that it was my desire that truth Might appear , and be seen where it was , & so was ordered to write to him again , wherein i then offered in the fear of the Lord , to reason with him , which he would not receive , but put it by , under false pretences , & false accusations , which in writing he sent unto me again ; & then the boaster was got up , and told me i stood spechless , and was silent , and had nothing to answer ; and seeing he would not be brought to any way by which his false accusations Might come to light , and his deceit discovered , i was moved to return unto him in writing some of his lies and slanders with which he falsely accused the truth , and the righteous generation , whom his scornful spirit calls the generation of Quak•s , whom he had also accused with many other things , which i did not return unto him with the rest , because he said i Might ere long hear him make them manifest in print ; and in that writing he sent me some queries to answer , though he had plainly denied to answer mine ; therefore i laid it upon him , that what he had in private papers written , and charged upon the truth , he Might prove , and print them and his queries also , with the rest which he had said he would make manifest in print ; but he not being willing to make all his lies and deceit so public , as in print , he writes unto me again , and therein offers proof to what was returned unto him , and laid upon him to prove publicly , and saith he had proved them all before , as his writings made manifest , and it was but shifting and dissembling to call for new proof ; yet he saith , that both i and others May see his readiness to prove what he had said , he had sent plain proofs of the 20 particulars , which he said i Might have drawn into 12 or 14 , seeing 6 or 8 of them , all concerned one and the same thing : but he said , the Quakers loves to be numerous . 

Let the simple-minded here observe , and the spiritual judge what thick darkness is upon him , to say , we love to be numerous , when all the particulars which i returned unto him , were invented by him , or some other for him , and sent with his own name unto them , which now he saith Might have been drawn into fewer ; did not he first make them numerous , by multiplying of them without need ? and i did but writ ▪ what i received from him , which he now condemns as numerous , and so out of his own mouth is judged to be a transgressor , allowing that in himself , which he condemns in another : and that some of his deceit May come to view , and that it May be seen what proof he offers , and of what nature they are , and thereby it May be judged how he proved his lies before , which he saith his writings will make manifest , i shall here therefore give forth the particulars which unto him i returned , and the proofs which he hath offered , with a short reply unto them severally , in which he is unveiled . 

Particular . the first is , that the Quakers observes the world's form . 

proof . this charge was to thyself , in observing the world's form in thy title page , of thy book , in which thou hast laid down thy weapons of defence . 

reply . that , by which every thing is proved to be truth , is truth , but no lie is of the truth , therefore thou hast but added sin to sin , offering one lie to prove another ; for in thy writing , these were thy words , i do not say that writing scripture phrases in a title page is against the truth , but against your own principle as you are Quakers , who cry out against •therss for following the world's form , and yet yourselves do observe it , therefore thou art found guilty of making lies thy kefuge , and would in thy ignorance persuade others that it is a proof of the matter : let the wise in heart consider , and that of God in all consciences judge , if this be a proof , of what thou hast falsely accused the righteous with , or if this charge was only to myself , or in general , from thy own words be thou judged , which i have here truly set down , that all honest minds May be truly informed , and thou May be convinced by that of God in thy own conscience to be a false accuser , and that is my weapon , in which i stand to defend the truth from thy lies , and it will cut thee down , and there shall be none to hold thee up . 

2. partic. that they maintain their device of formal quaking . 

proof . that they labour to maintain their formal quaking , is laid open in their books , and writings . 

reply . such a proof May shame a formal professor , to reproach the saints condition , and call it formal , when the Lord by his power makes the earth to tremble and melt at his presence , of which condition , Moses , David , habakknk , and many others , were true witnesses ; which condition we own , and on the Lord do wait , that by the power of his spirit it May be wrought in the inner man , and it is the work of the Lord , who is unlimited in his power , and what he doth , who shall say unto him , what dost thou ? who works when , and where he pleaseth , as the wind bloweth where it listeth , which is in no formal practice bound up , or limited , neither do we so maintain it , either in book or writing , but thou hast added sin to sin again , and manifested thy envy to all moderate spirits , and no way that thou canst find out to help thyself , but by making lies thy refuge , for a liar thou art proved , and therefore hast no cause to think why thy words should pass for proof in any matter against which thou contendest , without thou canstbring plain scripture , to manifest that what thou contendest against , is contrary to the leadings , and guidings , and work of the spirit of truth , and the doctrine of Christ and the apostles in the scriptures declared ; but what thou hast done , doth manifest thy folly , and en•ity against the truth , and those who walk therein . 

3.  Pa••ic . That their light within , is a false harlot . 

proof . their light within is their false religion , being against the light and teachings of the scriptures ; and false religion is known of all , who knows any thing , to be a false harlot . 

reply . who comes to the knowledge of God's glory , comes to know him in the light which shines in their hearts , which light shines within , and brings to know God , where the pure religion is witnessed , which the scripture declares of ; but thouknowest nothing as thou ought to know , and so puts the true light for darkness , and calls pure religion a false harlot , for the true light which lighteth every man that comes into the world is Christ , joh. 1. 9 and he is the truth , John 14. 6. and they that follow him comes to the light of life , joh. 8. 12. and they examine themselves , and knows Christ to be in them according to the scripture , 2 cor. 13. 5. and he is in them the hope of glory , col. 1. 27. and this Christ we preach , and this grace of God we declare , which we know to be in us , and is truth in the inward parts which the Lord loveth , and will stand above thee , and all thy deceit , though thou hast blasphemed him . 

4 ▪ partic. that they steat scriptures to deck their false harlots with . 

proof . is proved in first calling the scriptures dead and liveless , to bring their false harlot called light within , into osteem , and then fills their mouths with it , to seem spiritualised , and to make the world believe 't is from themselves , and not from scripture ; and this was proved against these in thy title page of thy book to h. h.  

reply . the light within is already proved from plain scripture to be Christ the light of the world , and the eternal truth and power of God , and the scriptures are dead and liveless unto thee , who art at enmity with the light and life from which they were declared , and unto which they bear testimony , and therefore we deny thee , though thy mouth May be sometimes filled with scripture expressions , and of which it is now empty ; but the scriptures we own , and have unity with them in the same spirit from which they were given forth , and knows them to be fulfilled in us , who walk after the spirit ; and what thou sayest was proved before to this matter against me , is a proof which was of thy own inventions , as these are , which thou hast now offered to thy shame for ever , not giving a scripture expression , nor naming a scripture for what thou hast said ; but thy mouth is filled with lies instead of scripture , and that thou calls a proof . 

5. partic. that they labour to have the scriptures dead in m•nss est•mation . 

proof . is proved plain•y in telling men the scriptures are a dead letter , and a liveless book ; and saying it is a damnable doctrine to say the spirit is received by the hearing of faith preached , and believing according to the scriptures , and in calling the doctrine and ordinances of Christ in the scriptures , outward forms and liveless . 

reply . that which hath not life in itself is dead , and thou cannot deny it , and the book hath not life in itself , neither can the letter thereof give life to any , though they May read it and hear it all their life time , and if ever thou come to know the scriptures , and the true use of them , thou must come to the light which is the life of men , without whom all things are dead ; and it is a damnable doctrine to preach the letter for Christ , and set it above him , which is not according to the doctrine of those who were ministers of the spirit , and not of the letter , and this doth the letter declare ; and the spirit is not received by hearing or reading the letter , but by the hearing of faith preached in the heart by the spirit that quickeneth , and the doctrine of Christ and the apostles , which the scriptures do declare , and believing according to that doctrine we own , and in it walk , by the same spirit which doth not lead any contrary , who by it are guided , but leads into the fulfilling of all , and into the life where living virtue is received which from the beginning was ordained , which is not dead nor formal , but life and power ; but thou can sit down in thy own time , to eat and drink in imitation of what thy imagination comprehends by reading the scriptures , that the saints did , and so thou glories in appearance , and not in heart . 

6. partic. that they deny the scriptures . 

proof . is proved afore in which they are manifested to be the most audacious deniers of scripture that ever hath been , of all the Antich istian party . 

reply . that which thou hast proved afore , thou hast manifested thyself in , to be a servant unto him who is an enemy to truth , and every appearance of righteousness , which by the light is brought forth in the children of obedience , that strikes at every work of darkness , having no communion with it , and this makes him rage , in wrath and fury in thee , to speak great swelling words of vanity , and offer them for a proof that his lies Might have a likeness of truth put upon them , by which many are at this day deceived ; for the scriptures are owned and believed in , and the doctrine of Christ is obeyed , and the light is walked in , which gives us fellowship with the father , and with the son , where we have communion with the life ; but Antichrist denyeth the father and the son , and is at enmity with the divine nature , and fighting against every appearance of godliness , which from the living virtue thereof is brought forth , which thou makes thy great business to oppose , and contend against . 

7. partic. •hat they are not guided by that light and spirit that gave forth the scriptures . 

proof . is proved both by their denial of those scriptures and commands g•u•n forth by the light and spirit of God in the scriptures , and also in their se•ting up a pretended light within , contrary to any teachings of the spirit of God in the scriptures . 

reply . thou art proved a liar by plain scripture , in the third reply , where it is proved , that Christ is the light , and it was in their hearts , and this doth the teachings of God's spirit in the scripture witness , and we neither deny the teachings nor commands given forth by the light and spirit of God in the scriptures , but have unity with them , and the s•me light and spirit teacheth us , and unto the commands thereof we wait to yield obedience ; but it is thy business to make lies thy refuge , and adds one to another without shame , neither showing what the teachings and commands are ; which thou sayest the scriptures teacheth and commandeth , and what we deny ; nor what the light and spirit is , nor where to be waited for , which thou sayest we are not guided by ; but thou passeth all for proof , because thou sayest it . 

8.  Par : that they are evil dealers , and fighters against God . 

proof . is proved in their evil dealing , and fighting against the spirit of God speaking in the scriptures , and denying obedience thereunto , and railing against those that d• obey , to exalt their lying spirit against it . 

reply . what shall be done unto thee , oh thou false tongue , who without fear uttereth such lies against the innocent , who are guided by the spirit of truth out of all evil dealing , or wrong doing ! but thou art in the depth of the bottomless pit , and from thence foaming out thy own shame , not fearing to speak any thing which the lying spirit puts into thy mouth , and calls it a proof , when thou hast neither scripture ground , nor reason , to show for what thou sayest , but as the devil hatcheth mischief in thy heart , so with a ready mind thou serves him in what he will have thee to do , and so falsely accuses the innocent , who in all obedience serves the Lord , and walks-after the spirit , and yields all obedience to it , and yet thou sayest they deny the spirit of God speaking in the scriptures , but hast not showed what those speakings are , nor who they are that do obey , that they rail against , nor what the lying spirit is that they exalt , for what thou hast here laid down , is but in substance one with thy whole matter , which thou calls proofs ; for what thou hast to say is chiefly against the light within , and disobedience to the scripture teaching , in which thou hast been proved a liar and a false accuser , manifesting nothing but envy against the righteous generation , whose foundation is sure , and their footsteps so ordered upon it that all thy darts cannot make them to move , neither can the strength of thy might shake their foundation . 

9 part. that they have n•ither part in , nor fellowship with the scriptures . 

proof . what part or fellowship can they have with the scriptures , who deny their teachings , and commands thereof , and the spirits speaking 〈◊〉 and  〈◊〉 from their teaching , except that part and fellowship of condemnation which the scriptures doth pass sentence of , against all that disobey their teaching . 

reply . wilt thou not here see thy ignorance , to ask a question and offer it for a proof ? was ever any that thou readest of in the scriptures , who were guided by the spirit of truth , thus taught ? for the scriptures doth not set up itself , to be the teacher , neither canst thou prove it , or that the scripture passeth sentence upon any , but the Lord gives forth his word , that gives sentence against all the disobedient , & the scriptures do but declare that sencence which was given forth by the Lord ; and it is the grace of God that teacheth , and the anointing within , and this the scripture bears witness of , & directs the minds of all persons unto , where true teaching is received , from the true voice , & this we labour to draw all men unto , therefore thy condemnation will be from the light which thou art at enmity with , and hates it , because thy deeds are evil . 

10. partic. that they are guilty of taking counsel together against Christ . 

proof . is proved in their binding themselves together in many & several places , & thereby all the violence of words and writings that they can , draw men from the teaching of Christ & his apostles , to follow their false devices , and secret pretended light : 

reply . thou art in the heathens rage , & there fighting against the Lord , & speaking evil of the things thou knowest not , calling the light false and pretended , which Christ & his apostles preached for the doctrine of salvation , unto all that love it & believe in it , & for condemnation unto all that hate it ; & unto this light we exhort all persons to look unto & be saved , which is the eternal truth , which thou canst not prevail against . 

11. partic. that they seek to kill Christ in his witness . 

proof . is proved in their seeking to kill that Christ which is preached and taught in the scriptures , to set up their own fals• idol , which they call Christ within , never preached or taught in scripture , but the scriptures will be lively witnesses to their condemnation . 

reply . thou art a cruel blasphemer to call Christ within a false idol , & dare affirm that he never was so preached or taught in the scriptures ; dost thou talk so much of the scripture and their teaching , & hast thou never read in the declaration thereof that Christ is in heaven ? & did not he teach unbelievers to look for the kingdom of heaven within them ? and hast thou not read joh. 17. 23.  i in them , and thou in me ; and gal. 1. 15 , 16.  But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb , and called me by his grace , to reveal his son in me , that i Might preach him among the gentiles ; and col. 1. 27 , 28.  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery , among the gentiles , which is Christ in you the hope of glory , whom we preach : now let the wise in heart judge thy blasphemy , who hath denied Christ & the plain words of scriptures , & saith Christ within is a false idol , & that he was never so preached in the scriptures , when they preached that Christ that was in them , & not another , whom we know to live in us , & so preaches him , which thou by wicked hands crucifies & slays in thee , & so blasphems his holy name ; i am moved to warn thee to repentance , that thou Mayst not go on in the hardness of thy heart , to treasure up wrath , against the day of wrath , & revelation of the righteous judgement of God , for thou art in the gall of bitterness , and the bond of iniquity . 

12. partic. that they set up a kingdom of darkness . 

proof . is proved in setting up their low-bred devices of darkness , against the glorious and heavenly light of Christ in the scriptures . 

reply . let thy mouth of iniquity be for ever stopped , who hath denied Christ & the scriptures , & stands an open enemy against the glorious light of Christ , declared of in the scriptures ; but where is it written that the heavenly light of Christ is in the scriptures , but it is written that the true light is Christ , and the scriptures are not Christ , but are they which testifies of him , therefore thy understanding is darkened , & the god of this world hath thee captive at his will , & fills thee full of witchcraft , that by thy sorceries the simple minds are deceived , unto whose view thou art now opened , and thy enchantments is discovered , that thou May be seen naked and bare . 

13. partic. that they are against the scriptures . 

proof . was there ever any more grossly & wickedly against the scriptures than they who denied their life , disobey their teachings , boldly & audaciously , and sets up their own darkness which they call light , against the light thereof ? 

reply . thou hast here manifested thy folly , in asking a question and offering it for a proof , & speaking the same sentences over again which thou hast used before , and is replied to , but thou art is a lost man , who knows not which way to take , & so many times goeth backward , when he should go forward , as thou art doing , who knows not what to say to make up something , to call a proof ; but the scriptures thou hast denied , and it is plainly proved against thee , and the light which they bear witness of thou art an enemy unto it , and fighting against it . 

14. partic. that they deny the Lord that bought them . 

proof . is proved in their bringing in damnable here•ieses ; 2 pet. 2. 1. under a pretence of a light within , to deny the •ight of Christ held forth in the scripture ; as in the doctrine of redemption , saying , their light within is the redeemer , and that nothing without a man can redeem• him ; by which is denied that great redemption , and redeemer , who without •ll men , did redeem all men . 

reply . thou hast here brought a scripture , which is owned , and seen to be fulfilled in thee , that hast denied Christ within , who is the Lord , which is a damnable heresy , & contrary to the scriptures ; & doth not that scripture say , that such as bring in damnable here•ieses shall also speak evil of the way of truth ? & is not this thy great business to speak evil of Christ the light of the world , who is the way and the truth , which thou art speaking against , & so act out of the doctrine of redemption , not knowing thy redeemer to live , having not obeyed from thy heart the form of Christ doctrine , & so art not come to the work of redemption , which worketh by his own mighty power in all that believe in him , saving from fin , & redeeming from all iniquity , and making perfect for ever through the sanctification of the spirit , which is his work within , and yet without all men ; these things thou canst not reach unto , in thy wisdom below . 

15. partic. that they make the word of God of none authority . 

proof . is proved by their traditions against the teachings of the word of God , which tells men , that they who are without faith are without Christ , & the true light , eph. 2. 12.  But the Quakers tells men , who are without faith , that they have & must look to Christ & the true light within ; a flat contradiction to the diu•n• authority of the word of God . 

reply . all that knows the word of God , & the teachings thereof do see thee to be in that state as they were , who were without Christ ; & the apostle doth not say that Christ was not within them , but that they were without Christ , & without God , in the world , & therefore he calls them to awake & arise from the dead ,  Christ Might give them light , which was not a light without •nem , for that they had whilst they were dead , but to the light within them , did he mind them , which when they had received , they were made light in the Lord , & knew him to be the author of their faith , which he wrought in their •ea••ss by the word of his power , which is the word of faith preached , & stands in the divine authority of God , that so it is the true doctrine which the word of God teacheth , without any contradiction , that they who are without faith are without Christ ; & yet who are without faith are to look unto Christ within them , & obey him there , that he May work faith in their hearts , which those who are at enmity with him , doth not come to know , & so abides without him in the unbelief , & in the world , having no comunion with his life , & though such be without him , yet he is within them a faithful witness to reprove them in their own conscience , for their transgression & disobedience ; but the book unto thee is sealed & thou art unlearned & thy heart hardened , that thou wilt not believe truth , though from the living word of God it be declared . 

16. partic. that they set their hearts against the Lord's teachings in the scriptures . 

proof . is proved in their setting themselves in array against the teachings of Christ & his apostles in the scriptures , which is the open manifestation of the true light , & calling men into the desert and secret place , to look for light in the house of darkness . 

reply . Christ said , false Christ's & false prophets should arise & show great figns and wonders , insomuch that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect ; but saith he , behold i have told you before , wherefore if they shall say unto you , behold he is in the desert , go not forth , mat. 24.  If thy understanding was opened to know the scriptures , Christ's own words declares the• plainly what thou art , & what signs & wonders thou art showing to deceive by , saying , Christ is without , behold him there , Christ saith , go not forth , this is his own doctrine , & all believers obeys it , & that which they were not to go forth from , was within them and when those false prophets came which Christ said should come , John see their deceit , & their seducing spirit , in the same light , in which thou art now made manifest , & he exhorted to beware of that which did seduce , & to look unto that which was within them , which is the anointing , saith he , that ye have received of him & abideth in you , & you need not that any man teach you , but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and no lie , joh. 2 27.  And thus the scriptures comes to be known and witnessed in the unity of that spirit which is but one in all , Christ said false prophets should come , go 〈◊〉 forth , John saw them when they did come , and he said , abide in the anointing which is in 〈◊〉 ; and here is the pure doctrine of Christ & the apostle declared in the unity of the spirit , which thou art at enmity with , and so teacheth another doctrine , as all false prophets & deceivers do . 

17. partic. that they set up their own traditions . 

proof . is proved in setting up their pretended light , which is quite contrary to the light and teachings of scripture : 

rep. thou being in the state of darkness , calls good evil , and so falsely accuses the truth by thy lying spirit , which to make way for thy lies to be brought in , cries out against the truth to be contrary to the scripture-teaching ; and under this veil of thick darkness , was the Lord of glory crucified by the wise scripture-learned , who cried out against him , to teach contrary to what was written in the law and the prophets , and so enviously set themselves against him who was the end of the law and prophets , and falsely accused him ( As thou in that wisdom art doing ) who is the light of the world . 

18. partic. that they pull down the oracle of God in the scriptures . 

proof . is proved in their calling the scriptures dead and lifeless , and pulling their teachings from men's hearts and minds , that they Might receive their false voice which is quite contrary to them . 

rep. Christ's sheep hear his voice , and follows him , and his voice they know from strangers ; and it is the true voice which is uttered from God's holy habitation , which is sweet to all that love it , and a terror to all that hate it , unto which we mind all persons to give diligence , that with a ready performance they May obey and do whatsoever it doth command ; and this is the still voice which is behind thee , from which thou starts aside , and will not abide the reproof thereof . 

19 partic. that they set up their own idol-books as a living voice . 

proof . is proved in their setting up their books for teachers , and calling the scriptures dead and lifelefs ; which books compared with their denial of the scriptures teaching , are set forth with bl•sphemous titles . 

rep. the Lord God who lives for ever , pleads the cause of the innocent against thy false tongue ; and he that searcheth all hearts , and judgeth right in every conscience , knows that thou dost falsely accuse the righteous generation , and that there is no guilt upon them , as to what thou hast charged against them ; for they do not deny the scriptures , nor sets up their books for teachers , neither are the titles thereof blasphemous ; but in this thou hast served thy Master to the full , and to all moderate spirits art manifest to bear the image of him who was a liar from the beginning ; and thou hast neither showed what they deny the scriptures in , not what titles their books bears , nor how they are blasphemous , neither hast given any scripture-proof or expression for what thou hast said , but as thou hatcheth mischief in thy heart , so thou utters it without fear . 

20. partic. that they persuade themselves and others of a light within , without & against any testimony of scripture . 

proof . is proved in all their teachings by word and writing which chiefly consists in this , to te•• men who are not in the faith , that they must look only to the light within them , and not to the scriptures light , which is without , and against all scripture-teaching . 

rep. the beast hath been sore troubled for any defence against the lamb's power ; for thou hast had thy proofs so far to seek , that if thou hadst not gone down into the pit of darkness , where lies are invented , thou Might'st have stood silent , which had been better for thee then to make lies thy refuge , and with them accuse the truth , and rise up against the lamb and his followers , to make war , & rather than thou wilt stand still , thou wilt add lie to lie , & speak them over and over , as is manifest in the particulars , and what thou hast offered to prove them by ; and it is a true doctrine , and hath before been plainly proved , that all men are to look unto Christ who is the light of the world , that in his light they May walk , and know him to be the author of faith , and to work it in their hearts with power , and no unbeliever is to look unto any other thing but Christ the true light , and the author of faith , and the teacher , and there is not another , neither doth the scriptures set themselves in that place , but bear witness unto him unto whom all power is given , who by his own living voice calls all to come unto him , and they that come , he doth not cast off , neither sends them to the scriptures ( Not any thing else ) for life or salvation , but opens the fresh springs , where satisfaction and pure refreshment is received , and eternal life witnessed , and the scripture-testimony owned , and so by the light are thy lies and false accusations condemned . 

then thou sayst , th•• reminds me of what i ought to prove against 〈◊〉 which is , that thou goes upon thy belly , and feeds upon the dust . 

Thou didst confess in thy writing that it was the Lord's sentence against the serpent ; then look into the 23. of Matthew ; and there see what sort of persons they were that Christ calls serpents ; & though there be not thy name , yet thou hast the nature , and in that is working the same wickedness , and filling up the measure of thy fathers : and here thou Mayst read thyself , and thy portion ; and this is a plain proof to all the children of light , unto whom i offer it , who hath unity wi•h that which proveth all things 

than thou bids me labour to have my mind enlarged , though my body be in prison , & then askest , if the light within hath taught me to deny tithes without the scriptures ; and if i will say my cause is good , being for the nonpayment of tithes , and if the light within hath taught me that without the scriptures , than thou sayest he who throws me in prison May pretend as good a light within to demand them , as i to deny them ; but if i deny to pay because the scripture hath taught me otherwise ; thou askest , why i will not as well obey them in what they command me in other things , as in the nonpayment of money ; and then askest , why i will call them dead and lifeless , and yet call them for my defence when i am in need , then thou bids me consider well of this , and be not deceived . 

It is not my own labour that can enlarge my mind unto God ; neither is it the imprisonment of my body , that can keep my mind bound , but in the Lord's power my heart is enlarged , and i made willing to run the way of his commands , who is near unto me , and in the midst of my sufferings ; his comforts delight my soul , and his right hand upholds me , and my cause is good , being for the nonpayment of tithes , and thou canst not overthrow it ; and by the light of Christ in my conscience i am taught to deny them , and in the light i have unity with the scriptures , and am made to stand a witness against all deceit and oppression , as they did who gave forth the scriptures , knowing Christ the end of all types & figures , tithes , & temples made with hands , who is the unchangeable life ; but this gate is too straight for thee to enter in at , and the way to narrow for thee to walk in , and so thou lightly esteems of those that are truly called by the Lord to walk therein , and unto all things which by the doctrine of Christ in the scriptures i am commanded , i desire to wait , that i May perform them with a ready mind , and that i May as a good servant do the will of God who is my helper in the 〈◊〉 full time , and doth defend me from all false tongues ; neither  own , or call any thing for my defence in the truth , but he 〈◊〉 who is my life , in whom i trust , that doth not fail me , but 〈◊〉 wrought great things for me by his own arm , and i trust will 〈◊〉 deliver me , when the good pleasure of his will he hath performed ▪ so thy secret parts are unveiled , & thou art manifested where 〈◊〉 goes , and upon what thou feeds ; for it is the serpent's poison whi•• out of thy mouth is cast , who would give him that casts me into ••••on as good right to demand tithes by a pretended light , as i to deny them from the true light , & so by thy rule would make the thing pretended to be of equal weight , with that which in the truth is ••••blished ; for all that receives the spirit which is of God , knows the things that are freely given of God , and the light of Christ which enlighteneth every man that comes into the world , doth not give unto any man as good a right to demand any part of the substance which the Lord gives and increases unto me , as it doth unto me 〈◊〉 deny that ▪ •an of his demand , & to receive my own which the Lord hath increased unto me : and he who pretends such a light to ••mand that which is not his , nor which no man can in the truth giv• him any interest in , he errs from the true light , & his pretence 〈◊〉 not make his demand neither equal nor warrantable ; for the 〈◊〉 light doth not lead any man to covet , or to desire that which is 〈◊〉 his , but brings all that are guided by it to be satisfied & contented with the Lord's free-gift and increase unto them ; and so the tenth cock of hey or corn , or other increase , is as truly my own as the nine , being the same increase unto me from the Lord , and i 〈◊〉 challenge it as the Lord's blessing , and so receives it as my own , ••••ly from the Lord , without yielding any account to any man ; 〈◊〉 have the answer of a good conscience in it , and peace with God in suffering for it ; & who receives tithes , denies Christ the true light and who pays tithes , are not guided by him who is the end 〈◊〉 tithes , and of that covenant under which tithes were paid . 

Therefore look over thyself again , and be covered with shame , and let thy 〈◊〉 tongue be forever silent , who hath so proudly , scornfully , and disdainfully spoken 〈◊〉 the right way of the Lord , and those that walk therein ; so i have considered thee  light , in which all things are considered wel• , and sees thee to be a blasph•••e• , a 〈◊〉 a liar , and a slanderer , a•d so hath proved thee . Therefore the doctrine of 〈◊〉 is prea•ed unto thee .
