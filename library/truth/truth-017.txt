To the reader . 

Forasmuch as many who are partakers of the father's love , manifested in his son in measure , in whom these epistles hath found greeting ; with the same love in the upright hearted , to which it is a sure testimony of love from life itself , to the quickening , strengthening , confirm•ng , and arming of all such as have in the love , life and power heard , and received , and believed the truth as it hath been declared , and is in Jesus , in whom our faith is standing ; which faith worketh by the love shed abroad in our hearts , wherein we are reaching after each other in the sameness of love , which is the bond of our unity , wherein we are called together to be joined in the purity , power and life of one faith and love , therein to bear testimony ( As we have in our measures received ) to , and of the everlasting truth , wherein finding these epistles of such manifold service to the whole body , both for instruction , exhortation , strengthening , and forewarning , whereby there is or May be a safe arming against all decee•t and decivable spirits ; hence it is from the earnest love and desire stirred up in many here among us that are faithful , whereby this they put in print , that thereby the service May reach unto all who are worthy thereof in these nations , for to them is it sent , who are called of God ; therefore in the fear of the Lord let every one of us to whom this comes walk worthy of the father's love , grace , mercy and peace , whereinto we are called in one body , of which Christ is head .

An epistle to all the saints whom God hath called . 

To all the children of light everywhere , who feareth and loveth the Lord , who are begotten of God , and unto whom he is known in the spirit and in the truth ; this is a testimony of the father's love unto you , grace , mercy , and peace from him that lives for ever , the god of light and life be multiplied in you all , that you May daily be renewed in strength , and girded with truth , and armed with the whole armour of God , and May be kept by his power until the day of salvation , to walk in the government and subjection to Jesus Christ , witnessing the power and presence of God in you , and amongst you , giving you power to fulfil his will in all things , and that in all righteousness , and out of all evil you May be led , and preserved unto the end , and in the end , to show forth the praises of God in this generation , as a persons called of him , and redeemed by him for his glories sake ; even so amen , and amen . Dearly beloved , be not ignorant , but this know , this is the message which came unto you , which is true and faithful , and everlasting , that the true God is light , and in him is no darkness at all ; and this is the message of peace and reconciliation , and of glad tidings unto all that have sought the Lord , which we received of him , and you have heard , and there is not another to be declared ; and all that have received it , are gathered up to God , and are in covenant with him , and one with another , and are in that which reconcileth and joineth unto Christ Jesus ( The husband ) and second Adam , who is the Lord from heaven , the Prince of peace , the saviour and the deliverer , who is made manifest in power , and condemneth the transgressor , and slayeth the enmity , and raiseth the life out of death ; and this is he who kills and makes alive , even the god who is light , who brings down one , and sets up another ; who makes war against the mighty , and gives peace to the poor ; and besides him there is none ; he searcheth man's heart , and trieth the reins , and knows the thoughts , and every creature is manifest in his sight , who gives to every one according to his doings ; and this is he who standeth in the congregation of the righteous , even in the midst of us , & sitteth judge among the gods , unto him must all the gods of the earth bow , and the inhabitants of the earth must tremble before him , and unto him every tongue shall confess , and the light in every man shall answer when he ariseth to judgement , who is a swift witness to condemn or justify all the children of men upon the face of the earth . 

This is the god of truth whom we worship , and who will be worshipped in spirit and in truth , who is the god of Abraham and his seed for ever ; and with him there is no change , nor shadow of turning ; and he hath made known his name , and his power , and his wonderful works in this his day , and hath caused his voice to be heard in the earth , and the dead hath heard and now liveth . 

And his name is exalted on high amongst all that fear him and obey his voice ; and he hath given his son a covenant of light , who lighteth every man that cometh into the world with the true light of life , or condemnation , that all who receive him May come to the knowledge of the father , whom to know is life eternal . 

And this is the Christ , the saviour , in which we have believed , and which we preach , who is the way , the truth and the life , the foundation of God which cannot be moved , the word of God is his name , and there is no other name given for salvation . This is he that was dead , and is alive , and lives for evermore ; and there is no other to be looked for ; if any preach any other , let him be accursed ; and if any bring any other message , let them not be received . 

And all you who have believed in this Christ Jesus , who is the light of the world , and who have received the knowledge of this God , who is light himself , and that searcheth your hearts , i exhort you , and warn you all in his presence that lives for ever , to wait upon him , and to fear before him , and to walk with him for ever in uprightness of heart , which is of great price in his sight , and forget not his righteous judgements which he hath made known , least you wax fat through mercies , and rebel against him , and become disobedient and gainsaying , and so be destroyed from being a persons ; but be stayed upon the Lord , and let your hearts be established with grace , and be not tossed nor shaken with any wind of doctrines of men , which is not from the life of God , nor reaches to the life in you , but begets into idolatry , to worship other gods than he who is light ; and be not troubled at temptations , nor at sufferings , nor at reproaches , nor any other thing , but stand in the counsel of God , and in his long-suffering , and wait patiently upon him in your own measure of the grace of God received , which is sufficient for you to preserve you , that victory over death and over him that hath the power over it , you May receive , to trample upon all that which is contrary to the life of God within you , and without you ; neither be you troubled nor offended in Christ if any among you deny the Lord , and backslide from his pure way through an evil heart of unbelief , and so become disobedient children , and vex the righteous soul ; such shall bear their own burden and condemnation in the day of the Lord ; and know , that truth changes not , but is the same for ever , though the deceitful hearted , through unbelief , depart from it , and choose their own ways , and despise the counsel of the Lord to their own destruction ; but be ye more watchful , and faithful , and valiant for the truth upon earth unto the end , that you May be found faithful witnesses unto the name of the Lord in this crooked generation , and May receive the fulfilling of the promise of God , and May witness God with you , the Emanuel , the saviour , God with us ; and this is the whole salvation , and there is no other to be expected or witnessed then this , that God dwells in us , and walks in us , according to his promise ; and all that know this , needs not go forth to the right hand or to the left ; but salvation is come unto us , he that takes away sin , and saves from it , and from condemation ; and who witnesseth this , are begotten by the word of God , and born of the immortal seed , and are new creatures ; and there is now no condemnation , but the reward of righteousness and peace to us , who are not in the flesh , but in the spirit ; and here we witness the Lord is our god , and we are his persons , and he sees no sin in us who are born of him , nor remembers iniquity ; but his covenant is with us , and the kingdom is become the Lords , and his dominion is set up , where God is all in all , where the Prince of darkness is cast out ; and this is the end and substance of all ministrations , which we bare witness of , and i do exhort all you that are called of God everywhere , patiently to wait in the way of the Lord , and in his judgements to receive this , and to possess it within you , that you May be worshippers of God , and doers of his will , and May have the witness that you are accepted of him , and May know your calling and election sure , where nothing that defileth can enter , but that May be taken away and removed , and him you May feel and witness , which Satan hath nothing in , who is the second Adam , and cannot be overcome , but is greater than the first Adam who was overcome ( Though innocent ) and is lost from the presence of God ; but he in whom there is no sin , & who cannot transgress , comes to seek & to save that which was lost in sin , and to bring back that which was driven away by sin ; and he is greater than innocency , and overcometh the devil , and is called the son of God ; and to him that overcometh , who is the light of the world , is all power given of the father : and know him in you all to be the greatest , who is not of the world , nor cannot bow to the devil , to give you dominion and authority over all the world , and the powers of hell and death , even he who sealeth up the old dragon in perdition never more to deceive : and who witnesseth this , knoweth the election which it is not possible to deceive , or be deceived ; and as every one of you hath received him who is the Lord from heaven , so let your faith stand in him , and walk in him ; and let all your conversations be ordered by him , in all pure and blameless walking in the sight of your enemies , that it May be manifest that you are branches in him , and that you have received power to become the sons of God , and that you are heirs of the inheritance which shall not fade away . And all you that witness this , your eye is opened to see God , and you are cleansed from sin by the word of God , and you have received the peace with God , and glad tidings from him in your own souls ; and this is salvation by the second Adam ; herein be established and settled , and look not for another ; for there is not any besides this saviour and this salvation , but if any preach another , believe them not ; and if any cry , lo here , and lo there is Christ without you , go not after them , nor follow them , but know him within you , which is greater than all ; yea , if we ourselves , or an angel from heaven , preach any other Jesus than he which lighteth every man that cometh into the world , or any other salvation than God with us , let us be accursed ; for this is the gospel of our salvation , Christ Jesus within us the hope of glory , the power and wisdom of God to rule and reign in us , by which we are changed from death to life , and translated from the power of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son . 

And now all friends and elect of God , who are called and faithful , you that have received this testimony which God hath given of the son , and which the son hath given of the father , which in faithfulness hath been testified in this generation , i exhort you all in the fear and counsel of the Lord , take heed to that which you have believed , and heard , and learned of the father , which is the truth as it is in Jesus , and shall abide for ever ; and be not removed from your hope , nor given to change , but mind the life of God in you all , which is immortal , and is but one , and it answereth to the Lord in judgements , and in mercies one to another in that which is righteous and just , and witnesseth against all the works of the world , which are evil , and not wrought in God . 

Ye that know this which is of the father in you , dwell in it , and walk in it , and be not shaken out of it , nor removed from it , for it is the way of peace unto everlasting rest , where there is no sorrow but righteousness , peace and joy in the holy ghost , and every one in particular have salt in yourselves to savour withal , that you May resist the wicked one in all his temptations , and May not join to any thing which is out of union , and contrary to the life of God , & to the truth which you have received , that you May never be betrayed of your hope , nor of the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus , in which the father is well pleased ; and let the light of the world guide you in all things , that your works May be wrought in God , never to be condemned , nor you to suffer loss , knowing this first , that none are justified by him but them that are led and guided by him ; and to whom he is a saviour , he is also a teacher , and he is given to teach in all the ways of truth . 

And now let your fellowship be in the power and life of God , and know not one another in words only , and in shows , and in outward appearance , but witness one another in the spirit and in the truth , and have communion there in breaking the bread of life , that Christ Jesus May be seen to be the head in you , and you members to serve him and one another , all receiving wisdom from the head and virtue , and virtue from the vine ( Christ Jesus ) that you May abound in love , mercy , and peace , and all the fruits of righteousness unto the father , and dwell in the fear and counsel of God , and be subject to his will , not despising the cross which is the power of God , which slays the birth that is born of the flesh , which is not heir of the promise ; but walk in the cross daily , that your understanding May be kept open to try and discern all spirits , whether they be of God , and believe not every spirit , for lying spirits May arise among yourselves , and go forth from the light , who is not in the truth , but in the feignedness and hypocrisy , with false visions , and lying imaginations , handling the word of God deceitfully , and corrupting and perverting the pure way of God , having the form , but not the power , having left the power , and gone from the light , and such utters the words of truth without the life , and is but as the chaff to the wheat , and they are to be denied and resisted , and not joined to , least innocency and simplicity be betrayed , and your faith made void , and so you be destroyed from the life of God , and death surprise you , and darkness enter into your dwellings , and so unbelief , and doubtings , and murmurings , and luings after evil arise in you , and you be perverted from the worship of the true God , and grieve his righteous spirit by bowing to idols , and following of other lovers , and so the true God , which hath brought you out of Egypt , and made manifest his power in you ; be forgotten , and the faith of his son made shipwreck of and your later end be worse than the beginning , and the name of the Lord be dishonoured by you ; and then woe unto you , his wrath shall suddenly break out against you ; wherefore hear , and fear , and hearken unto the word of the lo•d , he hath caused his light to shine forth , and his voice to be heard ; he hath proclaimed his name amongst you , and hath caused his marvelous light to approach when you set in darkness in the land of the shadow of death , when you were lost he sought you , and when you were driven away and scattered , he found you , and brought you home ; when you were in your blood , and no eye pitied you , he had mercy upon you , and bound you up , and healed you ; when you were dead , he said unto you , live , and it was so ; when you were led captive by the devil , under the power of death , he break the chains , and set you free ; and when there was none to help & to save , his own arm brought deliverance and salvation , and the way of life and peace he set before you . 

And now all this hath his own arm accomplished , that you should be a praise unto him for evermore ; now if you walk in the way which he hath set before you , and keep his covenant which he hath made with you , and fulfil his will , and walk in righteousness , in love and unity , in meekness , lowliness , humbleness , and in soberness , and watchfulness , and in fear of his name ; then shall his presence never forsake you , nor his outstretched arm cease to defend and preserve you , but he shall go before you , and be your reward ; and he shall be your God , and you shall he his persons ; and you shall dwell in him , and he shall be your hiding-place ; and he will be to you a father , and you shall be his children , and his blessing and peace shall remain in your habitations for ever and ever ; but if any of you turn aside for a thing of naught after vanity , and deny the way of righteousness , and forget the Lord , and kick against him , and follow the way and counsels of your own hearts , and worship other gods , and join yourselves to strangers , and commit adultery with other lovers , and make the cross of Christ of non-effect , and turn from the light of Christ within you , and fulfil your own wills , and the desire of your own minds , and go out of the fear of the Lord into the liberty of the flesh ( Which is not the liberty in Christ Jesus ) and so seek yourselves , and strive for mastery to be one above another , and so surmise evil one against another , and the bond of peace be broken , and vain contention and strife appear ; then shall the rod of God smite you , and his wrath be suddenly kindled against you , and you shall not prosper , but his countenance shall be hide , and the terrors of the Lord , and lamentations shall possess you , and peace shall flee far from you ; and such shall be cast out of the camp of the Lord , and shall have no part in the inheritance , but the blessing shall depart , and the curse shall enter till utter destruction ; yea , and if any of you deny the Lord unto whom his way is made manifest , he will deny you , and you shall have no part in him , but vengeance in flames of fire will he render upon the disobedient , manifold more than if his love and way of peace had not been made manifest to you , and the light of the world is your condemnation for evermore if you turn from it . 

And in the presence of the living God i warn you all , believe not that spirit , neither follow it which brings any other message then what hath been declared from the beginning ; believe not him which cries , lo here , or lo there is Christ without you , or that draweth from the measure of Christ within you , to hearken to , or to be taught by any other thing , for that spirit is not of the father which preacheth any other Christ than he that is the light of the world , and lighteth every man that cometh into the world , and which bringeth any other message then that God is light in himself , and hath given his son a light into the world ; and this is the true testimony of the father and of the son , and he that testifieth any other message , is to be judged and denied ; he is not a worshipper of the true God , but out of the truth , and in the error , and a deceiver , and being deceived . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which ministers to others that which it hath not learned of the father , but hath the words without the power , and lives not in the power of what it ministers forth in words , nor is not what it declares , but is in the outward shows , in the hypocrisy and feignedness , and reacheth not the life of God , but vails and covers it , and that spirit is not of the father , but is to be denied and judged , and not received nor believed . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which is at liberty in the flesh , and makes the offence of the cross to cease , which is exalted out of the fear of the Lord in the liberty of the earthly , which crucifies the life , and darkens the eye ; and that spirit will boast of joy , and peace , and experience , and knowledge , and speak high words in the airy mind , and that would lead you out of your conditions to glory above the cross , till you be past feeling of the life ; and that spirit begets into feignedness and hypocrisy , and into the love of the world which passes away ; and beware of that spirit , for it is not of the father , but to be condemned . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which is hasty , and forward , and rash , for that goeth out of God's counsel , and betrays the just , and strives to be greatest , and to be above the weak , and despises him , and would be Master , and not a servant , and would rule , and not be ruled in the meek & lowly government of Christ , and that spirit will judge out of thoughts rashly and unfavourily , and condemn another in secret in what itself is guilty of ; beware of that spirit , for it is not of God , but to be judged with the life of God . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which seeks itself to have praise of men , and to be accounted , and would beget into divisions , and would have parties to itself , and respects persons , and glories in gifts , and knowledge , and parts , more than in the giver , and admires men more than he that gives the increase , and feeds of the knowledge in that nature which is to be famished , and glories in what hath been done by it as though it had not received power from the Lord , and is exalted as though it bare the root , not knowing that it is born of the root ; and that spirit spends its treasure which it received in the father's house , amongst harlots , and despises the poor , and seeks occasion to glory over the weak , that it May be renowned ; beware of that spirit i charge you all , for it is not of the father , nor to be followed , but to be condemned , and resisted unto death . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which preaches not from the measure of God received , and to be manifest to it in you , and approved by it only , but speaks above the measure , and reaches not to the measure of the grace of God ; that spirit leads after words and outward shows , and cries peace to the rich , and judgement to the poor ; & the word of God is not divided aright , but heals up falsely , and daubs with untempered mortar , and cries peace where gods speaks war ; and cries war where God speaks peace ; and that spirit is a deceiver and a betrayer , and feeds but the ear , and not the life , and darkens the counsel of God by words without knowledge , and is not of the father , but of the world , & to be denied and condemned . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which is not subject to rule and order , and is not meek , and diligent , and long suffering , but heady , and high , and untoward , seeking occasions against the just , and watches for evil ; that spirit will not bear reproof , but is idle , slothful , and careless , and surmising evil , and backbiting , and conforms in appearance , making a fair show , but is not unto God , as appearing unto man ; and that would go , and is not called ; and will not go when it is called ; and seeks for the praise of men more than God , and that is fruitless ground , and brings forth briars and thorns in secret , which chokes the seed of God ; beware of that spirit , it is a lover of this world ; have no fellowship with it , for it is not of the father , but a deceiver , and is to be denied . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which is tossed and unsettled , and is given to change , and is not established with grace , that is an adulterer , and hunts for the precious life , and seeks by flattery to beguile the innocent ; that spirit is zealous for a moment , but is soon overcome , and is stony ground , and brings not forth fruit to perfection , but withers , and its later end is worse than the beginning . That spirit is exalted into presumption , and in peace , and cast into desperation and trouble , and the double mind lodgeth in it , and it is unstable in all its ways , & is a ground for the seed of Satan , and to it there is no peace from God ; and beware of that spirit , for it is not of the father , but to be condemned . 

Again , believe not that spirit , neither follow it , which is more zealous than knowing , whose zeal is without true knowledge , and stands in that which is corrupted , that flourisheth for a moment ; but cannot endure for ever ; it hath no root in itself , but is furious and passionate , and not long-suffering , that spirit knows not itself , but would devour its adversary with bitterness , and not gained by long suffering ; that is not the spirit of the father , but must be denied in all . 

Again , believe not that spirit which draws back into the world , into its lusts , and liberty , and fashions which passeth away ; that spirit forgets God , and draws back , for his soul hath no pleasure in it , but is vexed with it , where the cross is made of non-effect , and the false liberty is walked in , which murders the life ; that spirit is of the devil , and is to be condemned . 

And now all friends of God everywhere , who knows him , and are known of him whom he hath gathered out of this untoward generation ; be diligent in your callings , and keep your meetings in faithfulness , waiting upon the Lord , that you all May receive of his fullness to be filled with it , and May be nourished up unto himself , as trees of righteousness , the planting of his own right hand , to spread forth his name and glory , as a persons saved by him , and to whom there is none like besides . And this know and understand , that spirit is not of the father which confesseth not the son to be come in the flesh , who destroys the works of the devil , and takes away sin ; and that spirit it believe and follow which condemns sin , and destroys it , and takes it away , and so gives peace with God in your own consciences , and leads you into all truth , and keeps you from all evil ; & you that witness this , the son you know , and the father you know to dwell with you , and in you ; and this is the first and the last ; believe in him , and follow him , and look not for any other ; and in this the father of life and glory , whose dominion is without beginning and end , establish you , and preserve you , amen , and amen . 

I a beloved brother , and a companion unto all the saints in suffering , and in rejoicing , who have received this testimony from the father , doth with it in this epistle salute the whole church in the love of the father , as moved of him by his eternal spirit , who beareth witness to me that we are of God , and the whole world lies in wickedness , and that all that are of God heareth us . And this testimony i give of the father , and of the son , and of the truth , and of the salvation of which i am made a witness , and against all that ever shall deny it , or turn from it : and this is thus far the words of my testimony by the spirit of the father , not knowing when the time comes it May be finished , and the night May come when no man can work . 

Edward Burrough : 

To all that suffer for the testimony of Jesus , and for his names sake . 

The glorious god of truth hath appeared and made known his way and truth perfectly in this our day , and hath chosen unto himself faithful witnesses , to testify of his name , and of his truth before rulers and persons , and hath brought forth a seed which is not of this world , which cannot bow to the devil , but is heir of God's inheritance , though a sufferer in this world under the powers thereof , and many in this generation , who are called , and faithful , and chosen , bears witness unto the name of the Lord in sufferings and tribulations , whom he will honour because they honour him , who is exalting his truth and his persons through sufferings . 

And now all friends who are called to suffer for the testimony of Jesus , and for the exercise of a pure conscience which you hold , be valiant for the truth upon earth and faint not , but finish your testimony with joy for the Lord , and against all your enemies , and look not forth at afflictions and sufferings , but look beyond them to the recompense of reward ; neither be offended in Christ , though ye are called to suffer for him , and for his names sake ; but dwell in the peace with God , which is a sufficient reward ; and take heed to your life which is immortal , that it you May feel and enjoy , and account that the present sufferings is not worthy to be reckoned with the glory that is to be revealed , and of which you have the earnest , even present peace with God ; and look beyond your sufferings , and before the rage of man was , and feel the life of God in you fresh and lively , which is more than all things , to carry you above all the world , and all its envy , which is against the seed of God . 

And take heed of temptations , for the power of Satan will work , and is near to tempt you in sufferings , to gain dominion over you , and to touch your life , and to cast you down : therefore mind the life of God in you to have dominion , which Satan hath nothing in , which is not given him to touch ; and that is more than all , yea all that a man hath will he give for his life to enjoy it when he is tried ; ( This i witness ) & you are tried by sufferings and tribulations , and your faith and patience is proved ; therefore approve yourselves faithful unto the Lord by long-sufferings and patience , that Satan overcome you not , though he May touch you , and have power to cast some of you into prison , and otherways to win now you , and to try you for your life ; but be faithful unto death , and you shall receive the crown of life eternal ; and keep the word of his patience , that you May be delivered , and Satan May bow under your foot . 

And all you that suffer for well doing , who holds fast the testimony which you have received of God ; now when your hearts are searched , blessed from the Lord you are , your reward you shall possess , which no man can take away , even the life , and liberty , and treasure which Satan cannot touch nor spoil you of . 

Ye that suffer because you cannot fulfil wickedness , nor the will of man , but are of the seed which cannot please man , nor bow to the devil ; ye suffer for Christ , and for righteousness sake ; who cannot walk contrary to the light of Christ within you , but rather chooses to suffer under corrupt men and laws , then to transgress God's righteous law written in your hearts ; you are chosen to fulfil the will of God by sufferings , and are not of the world , and therefore the world hates you . 

And all you that suffer imprisonment of body , or spoiling of goods , or travels , or any other thing , because you cannot pay tithes , this is the word of the Lord God unto you , you suffer for righteousness sake , and for the name of Christ , and unjustly , by the oppression of men for well-doing , & not for evil ; & the Lord will be your exceeding great reward ; look beyond your outward liberty , and know the liberty in spirit , in the father , and in the son ▪ where is everlasting peace and freedom , which none can bring into bondage ; and look beyond all outward treasure and riches , and see God's treasure , and possess it , which never waxes old , which none can spoil you of , as witnesses for the Lord , and for his truth and covenant ; you suffer , and it is for a testimony against all your enemies , and against oppression , and oppressors ; for the cry of that oppression the land groans under , and for ages hath done ; but the Lord is now risen against it , for its cry reacheth to heaven against the unrighteous exactors , whose cruel hands hath heavily oppressed the just and the poor in this particular ; and herein your suffering is for a testimony against your cruel adversaries , ( Whether priests or others ) and against the unjust judges and lawyers , and their whole train of oppressors ; for this end are you called to suffer , and to you it shall be made easy if you abide in the counsel of God , till vengeance overcome your adversaries ; therefore lift up your heads , and fulfil the will of your father in patience and in faithfulness , till the Lord appear for you , who hearkeneth to the cry of the poor , and regardeth the unjust sufferer , and will recompense the oppressors into their bosoms , and will break every yoke , and be a terror to all the cruel hearted . 

And all you that suffer , who are moved by the power of the Lord to bear witness against the false worships , and against the false teachers and idol-temples , of which the land is full , and who are moved to testify against sin in rulers , priests , or persons : whether your suffering be imprisonment , or beating , and stoning , or other abuses or cruelties whatsoever , which the devil hath power to lay upon you ; you suffer for righteousness sake , and for the name of Christ , and for well doing , if in the wisdom of God you be guided , and the Lord will be your reward and peace for ever ; lift up your head , and rejoice in him , and abide in his counsel , ye that suffer herein for him , and for his names sake ; for your suffering is for a testimony against all this generation , against the idol worships and ways , which God's soul loathes , and which he will confound ; and against the idol teachers , and false prophets and priests , who preach for hire , and make merchandise of souls , against whom God's wrath is kindled , and upon whom his indignation will be poured , and it is a testimony against the sins of rulers and persons , which abounds in this generation , till the measure of it be fulfilled through persecuting of you , who warn them of the evil , and bears witness against their evil deeds , that God May be justified when he condemns them ; and he is risen against the worships , and ways , and teachers , and persons , whose abominable iniquities hath overgrown the world , and profaneness hath gone forth from them , through nations ; rulers , and teachers and persons are all out of the way , and given to vanity , to covetousness , and idolatry ; and the breath of the Lord shall consume you together ( All who doth oppress the just ▪ ) 

Therefore friends , be patient and content under all tribulations and sufferings , and feel God's living presence near you , to overshadow you , and to be your hiding-place ; and know the life which the wickedness and cruelty of man cannot touch nor reach unto ; and dwell in the power of the Lord , which moves to bear witness for him , and against all those abominations ; and that will keep you above all the afflictions which can be cast upon you , and you will be on the top of your enemies , and the seed of the serpent shall hardly bruise your heel . 

Woe unto the idol worships , and temples , and teachers , to all the hirelings and deceivers , who feeds themselves and not the flock , which abounds in the world , and in this nation , they must down into perdition ; the Lord is risen against them all , to pluck up the root , that the branches May wither ; and his arm shall watch over them to overthrow them all , and to make them desolate , that the just May be delivered . 

And all you that suffer anywhere imprisonment , or finings , or reproaches , or any other thing , because you cannot swear for conscience sake , nor respect persons , according to the vain customs of the heathen , but are redeemed out of the customs and superstitions of men which are of the world , and are evil , and not of God , nor justified by him ; you suffer for righteousness sake , and for Christ's sake , and are witnesses for God herein against the superstitions , and wickedness , and pride , and high-mindedness of men ; and the Lord is with you if you be ruled in his wisdom , and are faithful to him ; and he will lift up your head till his and your adversaries be confounded . And i charge you all in the presence of the Lord , who suffers for righteousness sake in these things or in any other , who are moved of the Lord to bear witness of the truth , and against the deceits of the world , be not exalted in the flesh in your sufferings least you forget God : nor be not cast down into sorrow , least ye be overcome of the devil ; but dwell in the measure of the power and life of God , which is above all , and more than all , and feel God's living arm to stay your hearts to watch to his own in you , to refresh you continually . And resist the devil on every hand with the armour of light and truth , that your life May be preserved in dominion over all things ; even the life which is not of this world in you , May not be veiled nor overcome , for to enjoy the life of God with you is enough , if you pass through the fire and through the water , it keeps you , and carries you above all , [ this i witness ] and it is more than all outward freedom , or liberty , or riches and treasure of this world ; and walk herein in boldness , and faithfulness , and patience , as you have us for an example in Christ Jesus , who are in jeopardy every hour , often in trials , and sufferings , and dangers , and loves not our lives unto death for the testimony of Jesus which we hold , and that his name and truth May be exalted in the earth ; but as the Lord moves are carried through nations , among lions and devourers , such as seeks our life for their prey , and yet the Lord is with us , our defence , and arm , and preserver above all . Therefore look you at the Lord in all afflictions and distress , and know his reward with you , that your burden and yoke May be easy , and not hard ; for his presence makes all things joyful ; and know , that it is for the name of the Lord , and for his honour , and for his kingdom which God will set up through suff•ring ; for this cause are ye called to suffer , and your life , nor liberty , nor any other thing is not to be measured nor compared herewith . 

So unto every one of you i am moved to write , and to warn you all 〈◊〉 the fear of God , be content , and long suffering , and patient , and finish your testimony with rejoicing , if ye seal it with your blood , and dwell with the Lord in his holy habitation of peace , out of respect to time or places , or things , and give up yourselves , that his will in you May be fulfilled . And think it not strange though you have fiery trials ; neither be moved at any suffering without you , or troubled in spirit ; neither let it break your peace nor fellowship with God by any impatiency or murmurings , or temptations , for then will your sufferings be grievous to you , and the enemy within and without will have ground against you to overthrow you , and know , it is that which ever was in all ages , and no new thing the seed of God suffered by the seed of evil doers ; and the wicked always strengthened their hands in cruelty against the righteous , and laid heavy burdens upon the just , and caused the innocent to groan under them for a time , till iniquity was fulfilled , that they Might be broken , and the oppressed delivered , and always the Lord exalted his name by the suffering of his persons , as we have a cloud of witnesses of our forefathers that went before , who did bear witness to the name of the Lord through faithful suffering ; so it is no strange thing hath happened unto you , but that which is common to all the saints , who enters the kingdom through tribulation ; blessed are you if you be faithful unto the end , that you May leap the reward of your works of your sufferings and patience ; even the crown of life that never fades away ; so the Lord God of life preserve you . 

And all friends everywhere , i am moved to warn you , dwell in love , and unity , and fellowship one with another in the light , and in the spirit of the father , and fulfil the law of Christ , and bear one another's burden , and suffer with one another , that none be oppressed among you in any thing whilst others are free ; but that the burden of all things , and the care of all things in relation to the truth , be equal among you according to every ones freedom , and as every one is moved of the Lord , so to administer to one another's necessities , as members of of one body , to the honouring of the head ; and spreading of the truth , that there be no complaining , but equality and justness , and the government of Christ ruling among you , and his wisdom in all things ; feed no excess , nor the lustful devouring mind in any ; neither suffer the distressed to perish for want , but reach one to another in love and like mindedness , suffering for one another , and all caring for the truth above all things , that God May dwell among you , and be known that he is in you of a truth . And in this the wisdom of God guide you all , amen . 

this is diligently to be sent among friends to be read among them , and to be sent from one to another as they are moved ; by a companion in tribulation to all the saints everywhere , 

Edward Burrough .
