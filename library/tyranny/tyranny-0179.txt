A mournful elegy upon the three renowned worthies , Duke Hamilton , the Earl of Holland , and the ever to be honoured Lord Capel , who were tyrannically murdered by a usurped illegal power of the wicked court of injustice , and pretended parliament , upon Friday , the 9 of March , 1649.  in the palace-yard before westminster-hall-gate . 

Awake my muse in a sad elegy , 
T' relate the murdering acts of tyranny , 
A once known vice , but now a virtue made , 
And ushered in by those who be not afraid 
Of heaven nor hell , of death nor judgement sure , 
There seared consciences do sleep secure ; 
With hands imbrued in blood of innocents' , 
With hearts remorseless , and with souls condence , 
Harder than flint , or rather adamant , 
killing the father , careless of th' infant ; 
Making poor widows comfortless abroad 
To wander with their children t' seek abode , 
In foreign lands , being bereft of goods , 
lands , houses , rents , yes and their husband's bloods , 
Spilt by base traitors to inebriate 
Their thirsty souls , whose stomach 's ne'er abate , 
But still are dry , and do again desire 
More loyal blood to quench that burning fire , 
Of hell's instigation which within 
Their envious bosoms hath this long time been 
Kept close and smothered , wanting power to vent , 
What hath this many years been their intent ; 
Till now at length our sins and vile transgression 
Hath moved our god , t' permit them with oppression , 
rapes , plunder , murder , tyranny , what not 
Well nigh the name of King amongst us t' blot , 
But this our comfort 's we have a sovereign God , 
Who when he  As scourged us , he will burn the rod : 
But what doth this avail us ? oh ! alas ! 
Whilst that our glory doth form 'mongst us pass , 
What shall we do ? alas ! let 's howl and weep 
To see our loyal nobles , killed like sheep ; 
Slaughtered by rebels , who like wolves devour 
And seek new ways t' entrap them every hour 
With subtle begins and snares of Tabor laid 
Like fowlers which are wont to that trade , 
Mispah's the hill whereon these tyrant's play , 
But all the land they make Akeldema : 
Come then join issue that Aonian band , 
Distil the sad complaints into my hand , 
With mournful muse complete my doleful pen 
T' bewail the loss of these three noblemen ; 
First Hamilton , who though he was a Scot 
Was honest to his King , therefore forgot ; 
He ne'er shall be for to 's immortal fame , 
Sad elegies shall be writ on his name ; 
Then drop a tear , and stain this paper now 
To see how loyalty is made to bow 
By base rebellion , oh ! with watery eyes 
Let each true subject read these elegies , 
Of famous Hamilton , and both the other 
Who shall in order follow one the tother : 
Of him ( Because a Scot ) I 'll say no more , 
But will the Earl of Holland's death deplore ; 
Who is our countryman , and aught to be 
Beloved , though blemished , with disloyalty ; 
Whether deserved or no i cannot tell , 
But of the dead , I 'll nothing say , but well : 
His actions at the last , did prove him t' be 
A lover of his King's posterity : 
And this is truth , then let black envy bark , 
And spit its venom , it will miss the mark ; 
For his fame will aye endure , and he 
Will sure be taken for an enemy ; 
traitors , and rebels , and with loyal tears , 
he 'll be lamented as the murdered peers , 
Of England , will be ; who , t' serve the King did die , 
The only badge of true nobility ; 
What can be more expected from one's friend 
Then t' give his life his person to defend , 
All which was done by these forementioned Lords , 
Whose loyalty both grief and joy affords ; 
T' each honest heart , even the flintyest stone , 
Lying in th' streets , with drops of dew bemoan : 
Our murdered nobles offering tears to shed 
To see nobility thus ruined : 
Their houses tattered , look like as forlorn , 
The pleasant birds that chirpt upon each thorn , 
Do seem to hang their wings , and cease to sing 
Aught but doleful notes , for our lost King : 
And his true subjects who have death disdained , 
And by their valours , honour have obtained ; 
Which would endure with them t' eternity 
If possible the world so long could be : 
And so I 'll leave them both to speak of him , 
Who hath substance of true valour been , 
renowned Capel , whose undaunted spirit 
Amongst his greatest foes did honour merit ; 
Whose actions manifested him to be 
A second Hector , or more in degree , 
Hated by Achilles , 'cause his fame 
Did seem to blemish great Achilles name ; 
Therefore with 's myrmidon's , he murdered quite 
That worthy Hector to increase his light , 
But come you Muses nine Melpomene 
And your dread mother sad Mnemosyme , 
For to lament brave Capel's death combine 
With eyes distilling tears , of crystal fine , 
heaven's weep your fill , and if the rocks be dry â–ª 
Lend water to them all their wants t' supply , 
For if i had th' monopoly of tears 
I 'd shed them all for these three murdered peers , 
And for my faults i wish that i could dip 
My pen in Helicon or Aganip , 
Then i could justly claim the honour t' be 
The author of bold Capel's elegy ; 
But tears do stop my genius , and my heart 
On recharged with sorrow , and possessed with smart , 
For such a noble worthy , whose brave deeds 
May be a mirror unto him that reads , 
In after ages and May cause them then , 
T' observe bold Capel as the best of men ; 
Then let both hills and rocks echo amain 
Hadaddrimmons , mourning on Megiddons plain , 
As for Josia's t'did that champion bold , 
So now for Capel , who is dead and cold , 
Why howl the fir-trees on mount Lebanon , 
Are all the stately cedars felled and gone ? 
No , no , alas ! they 're but removed 
Into a better soil , where they 're beloved : 
No envy there 's amongst them but true glory , 
Therefore with confidence I 'll write their story ; 
And shall desire each eye if not of flint 
To melt itself with sorrow , and to hint 
A show of grief , and doleful tears distil 
Upon the earth , or else the heavens will 
Water the plants with showers of greatest rain 
For him whose fellow , we's ne'er have again : 
Capel , the wellspring of true valour decked 
With loyalty , and a just true respect 
Of 's country's good , and of his sovereign's cause , 
Scorning t' submit himself to rebels laws , 
Was murdered by them ; but my comfort 's this , 
He now enjoies his god in heaven's bliss : 
Where he with angels pure , by God's permission 
May sit in judgement , and send to perdition 
Bradshaw , Steel , Cook , ask , Dorislow , and th' rest , 
Who did our King , and 's subjects all divest 
Of 's regal power : so give me leave to end , 
And to God's judgements , traitors t' recommend . 
Printed in the first year of rebellious liberty , and democratical tyranny . 1649.
