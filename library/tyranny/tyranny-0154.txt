AN ELEGY , UPON The Death , of that Famous and Faithful Minister and Martyr , M R. JAMES RENWICK . 

here 's work , alas ! for Mourners , to deplore 
This fatal stroke , sadly presaging more ! 
In such a day , let 's hang our harps on willows ; 
it 's not a time of laying heads on pillows : 
In such a day of Wrath , and Consternation , 
In such a day of Dread , and Desolation ; 
A day of trial , and of treading down , 
A day wherein our head hath lost its Crown , 
A day of Blasphemy , Rebuke and Trouble , 
A day of Darkness , and of Sorrows double , 
A day of great Vexations , and Confusions , 
A day of great Temptations , and Delusions , 
A day of Jumbling , manifold Distractions , 
A day of Stumbling , manifest Defections , 
A day of Famine of the word of Life , 
A day of Sinning , Suffering , and Strife : 
When Babel's Brats the World so much encumber , 
When Zions' Sons daily decrease in number , 
When now the Godly cease , the Faithful fail , 
When few are left , their Funerals to bewail , 
When naught but Thorns , where Corn grew , we can find , 
When Gold is gone , and Dross but left behind , 
When our Elijahs , Israel's Charot's gone , 
When yet , alas ! their Mantle's left with none , 
When many Hypocrites Christ's Fan discovers , 
When few are left , that are his loyal Lovers , 
When for his Laws , these few are sore oppressed , 
When for his Cause , they 're pillaged and distressed , 
When those are hunted , and always afflicted , 
When of all help , and harbour interdicted , 
When chased through Country , and pursued in City , 
When banished , butchered , yet , in stead of pity , 
( When counted slaughter sheep , and daily killed , 
By such as set at ease ) they much are filled 
With insolent contempt , and sad reproaches , 
Which of all falsehood , still the father broaches : 
When Popish Tyrants : vile Beelzebubs drudges , 
On Thrones of Tyranny , are owned for Judges , 
When now like stupid Asles , Men are mute , 
When such Usurpers challenge absolute 
And arbitrary power , to sacrifice 
Religion , Laws , and Lives , and Liberties ; 
When faithful gospel preachers are so few , 
Ensnaring times , to give a warning due ; 
When now foul murdering wolves , Christ's flock devour , 
When watchmen waiting are on Zions' Tower , 
When few that 's called do deserve the name , 
But many are the age's bane and shame ; 
When now in stead of valour for the truth , 
And crying loud with Trumpets at their mouth , 
Upon such loudly clamant , clear occasions ; 
( When Babel's bastards boldly make invasions , 
By blinding bribes , corrupting flatteries , 
By cunning craft , and cheating shams , and lies , 
Upon our Covenanted Reformation , 
And all our Liberties of Church and Nation 
Betrayed , by this Popish Toleration . 
Whereby this absolute power is recognosced , 
And all its proud encroaching are ingrossed , 
Our Laws Divine , Human , all made void , 
Religious legal bulwarks all destroyed , 
All Blasphemy , Idolatry , and Sin. 
●ow suffered , yea invited to come in , 
〈◊〉 Church of all her privileges robbed , 
And with a Kiss , under the fifth rib stobbed ; 
〈◊〉 Liew of all her laws , securities , 
All Oaths , and Vows , and solemn promises , 
Having no more assurance , than a blind 
Promise of one , whom no such bond can bind : 
Her doctrine , worship , and Church Government , 
According to our Solemn Covenant , 
All hereby undermined and overturned , 
For which her Sons should all have rather mourned ) 
Our Ministers for sin have made Addresses , 
Charmed with Babel's flattering Carrasses , 
Bewitched with this intoxicating drink , 
Which Hell did brew , and Rome with Art did blink : 
Cast in a deep Zeal quenching Lethargy , 
Purchasing hereby ease , and liberty , 
On terms of selling truth , and shifting duty ; 
Whereby Christ's bride 's deprived of all her beauty . 
In such a day to lose a faithful witness , 
And champion accomplished with fitness 
To strive for Christ's prerogatives , and laws , 
Must be bemoaned by all that love his cause ; 
Come therefore all ye Doves , that dwell i' th' rock , 
Come and deplore this wrath presaging stroke ; 
Come chased birds hotly pursued to mountains ; 
Come hunted hearts , which pant and pray for fountains 
Come wand'ring sheep , without a shepherd straying ; 
Come hidden ones , afraid of false bewraying ; 
Come all ye faithful followers of the Lamb , 
Whose heart in Zeal do for his glory flame , 
Whose hearts in fervent love to Christ are burning , 
Whose hearts do melt out at the eyes in mourning ; 
Come , with a flood of tears the valleys fill , 
And make your voice resound from hill to hill ; 
cause all the mountains circling round from Carrick , 
With roaring noise , rebound as far as Berwick ; 
From Carn-table skirts , and Abingilioch , 
To Marocks towering heights , and heads of ●illoch ; 
From Tintoch-tops , and all the hills of Clidsdale , 
To all the hills of Galloway , and Nithsdale ; 
From these about Black gannoch , and the Lothers , 
To Craufoord-muire , and Tweddal hills , and others ; 
Wherein we hunted were , through all the glens , 
Wherein ye hiding places sought in dens , 
Wherein ye often forced were to flights , 
Wherein ye often filled were with frights , 
Wherein your hands were strengthened , heads supported , 
Your minds confirmed , and your hearts comforted , 
While your Renowned Renwick , now a Martyr , 
Was passing through preaching in every quarter , 
His Master's glorious and gracious banner 
Displaying faithfully , in lovely manner : 
Like to a Voice in wildernesses crying , 
Making a noise most sweet , as swans when dying , 
Declaring all God's counsel , and revealed 
Truths , which alive h'asserted , dying sealed : 
But now in those waste desolate recesses , 
no voice is heard , but mourning for distresses : 
no voice is heard but that of grievous groaning , 
The glory gone , deplorably bemoaning . 
Come therefore and put on your sable , Saints , 
Fill all the val's with sad complaints , 
Whereof the eho may be heard in Heaven , 
In lamentation for the blow that 's given 
Unto the wounded weeping remnant left , 
Which of their Renwick is of late bereft , 
By murdering violence of beasts of prey , 
Rome's bloody whelps , torn from his house of clay , 
How may his little flock , alas , complain ! 
How may they now , so great a loss sustain ? 
Scotland hath lost , the world hath lost a man , 
Whose room supply , there few surviving can : 
The church hath lost a son more pure and dearer 
Than Ophirs gold , the truth a Standard-bearer ; 
●ion hath lost , by this complex disaster , 
A Witness , Wrestler , Mourner , and a Pastor ; 
The scattered sheep , a most laborious Leader ; 
Poor hungry Souls , have lost a painful Feeder ; 
The Sufferers , have lost a Sympathiser , 
The doubtful halting Souls , a good Adviser ; 
The weak , a wise encouraging Supporter ; 
The night-wanderers and mourners , a Comforter ; 
The tempted Souls , a Counsellor in terrors ; 
The ignorant , a Guide to keep from errors ; 
The zealous , from extremes , a holding Bridle ; 
The lazy sort , a Spur from being idle ; 
The temporising sort of faint complyers , 
duty 's deserrers , and Christ's truths deniers , 
May boldly now proceed in their backsliding , 
Since they that are delivered from his chiding , 
Who never ceased to be a free Reprover , 
Nor sins and snares in season to discover . 
How insupportable is such a cross ! 
How irreparable is such a loss ! 
O , let us now make search that we may know 
What may the meaning be of such a blow ! 
What sins have this procured , let 's meditate , 
What further sorrows   prognosticate ? 
Our misimprovements le 's now confess 
Of such enjoyments , our unworthiness 
Of Renwicks' gracious Message , little prized , 
And of his percious Ministry despised , 
Our barrenness , and base ingratitude , 
Our weariness of that Angelic food , 
Whereof the worth we know now by the want , 
And must henceforth in tears the loss lament ; 
These have this Rod in righteousness extorted , 
From a just GOD , and left us uncomforted : 
A Rod which we may sadly now suppose , 
A fatal forerunner of future woes , 
Impendent on this base degenerate age ; 
The perishing of worthies must presage , 
That they delivered are from that which we 
Are called to fear , but cannot bear , nor flee : 
But tho' our loss be great , his gain is Glory , 
His Life , his Death , shall be renowned in story ; 
Which death to us most costly and most painful , 
Shall to the Covenanted cause be gainful ; 
In that , in place of a reproached Pastor , 
A Martyr now renowned by this disaster , 
Is left us , to their everlasting shame , 
Who ceased not with lies to load his Name , 
And with reproaches foully to bespatter , 
Which malice did contrive , and madness scatter ; 
Which fraud invented , as its father feigned 
Fury did vent , and folly entertained . 
Now shall his Name in Monuments of praise , 
( Which to his fame posterity shall rise ) 
Still stand recorded , that he was a Martyr , 
Fruitful in life , and faithful in his departure : 
Contemned indeed by Apostats , and Scorners ; 
But eminent among all Zions' mourners : 
For love undoubted , and undaunted faith , 
For constancy unto his final breath , 
For patience abiding in all trial , 
For piety , and humble self denial , 
For meekness true , in condescending tender , 
For strickness due , ( he 'd not a hoof surrender ) 
For uniform true Zeal and Moderation , 
Of more than ordinary Elevation : 
Which with an equal pace did still advance , 
Against all defection and extravagance : 
All Bastard Zeal opposing with all boldness , 
As well as dead Laodicean coldness : 
For Ministerial diligence much framed , 
A Workman needing not to be ashamed ; 
In preaching all the Counsel GOD revealed , 
His Ministry on many souls was sealed ; 
Which in his Master's strength he did commence , 
And unto its fulfilment did advance , 
Against the violentest opposition , 
That ever any Youth in his condition , 
Had to conflict with , and at such a ●●●●on , 
When dangers seemed invincible to reason : 
For like another Athanasius bold , 
He all the World opposed and controlled 
And had all sorts of Men upon his top , 
All Prelatists , and Vassals of the Pope , 
Who did pursue him with all rage and rigour , 
With might , and malice , violence and vigour : 
Those brethren also , whom , tho' still he loved , 
He could not join with , but their sins reproved , 
Who unto Men their Ministry subjected , 
Or had submit to mischiefs they enacted , 
Or by Disorders had their charge perverted , 
Or had their duty in its day deserted , 
Or were in foul Compliances involved . 
Or those to daub and plaster were resolved , 
Or shamefully were silent at the times , 
Iniquities , when duties went for Crimes ; 
With those to strive , Zeal for his Master's glory , 
And indignation at their silly , sorry , 
Foolish , and feeble , fainting , cowardice , 
( That few their all for truth durst sacrifice ) 
His generous soul did vigorously excite , 
For which by some he was opposed with spite . 
With malice envy , and with cruel rage , 
That nothing could unto his death assuage , 
Yet maugre all assaults , his bow abode 
In strength , his hands confirmed by Jacob's GOD : 
By frowns , from duty never could he be daunted ; 
By flatteries , he never could be enchanted ; 
no fear of danger could him ever fear 
From diligence ; Nor disadvantage mar ; 
Nor any want of good Accommodations , 
could stop his pastoral exercitations ; 
〈◊〉 painful preaching , visiting , baptising , 
In conference , and in catechising : 
Even when in wandering he had no repose , 
But hags , or hiding holes , in fear of foes : 
Nothing to lay his weary head upon ; 
no couch but grass , no pillow but a stone ; 
no better chamber ofttimes he could have , 
Than a dark den , no closet but a cave ; 
Yet under all this inconvenience , 
He could possess his soul in patience ; 
His Master's favour above all things loving , 
Himself as his true Minister approving , 
By purity , by charity unfeigned , 
By verity in sanctity maintained , 
By wisdom , patience , by the spirits light , 
By righteousness on the left hand and right , 
Caring for neither calumnies nor honour , 
So that he might his conscience exoner ; 
As a deceiver , yet approven true ; 
As tho' well known , yet known but to a few ; 
As daily dying , and yet living still , 
As chastened , yet above their reach to kill ; 
As sorrowful , yet joying evermore ; 
As poor , yet making many rich in store ; 
In many wants , in manifold distresses , 
In pinching , prison , and in wildernesses , 
In painful labours , and in weary watching , 
In cold , and hunger , still in fear of catching ; 
In many perils , both by sea , and land , 
From enemies , and from false brethren's hand : 
Holland in part , Britain , and Ireland know , 
What perils he was forced to undergo : 
In none of which he any rest could find , 
But every where , both foes and friends combined , 
By tongue , and hand , him still to persecute , 
In a most keen and violent pursuit : 
Hence such a prize was set upon his head , 
And did entice to catch him , quick or dead , 
Hell's hottest Harpies , Villians , vildest Vermin , 
Who by all means to take him did determine : 
Therefore in fury they the chase did follow , 
By Hue and Cry , and many hideous hollow ; 
Through Cities , Country , Villages of Boors , 
Through wettest Mosses , and through wildest Muits , 
Through highest Mountains , and remotest Glens , 
Compelling him to Caves and hiden Dens : 
Where weary , cold , and hungry , he could find 
no comfort , but what from the Heavens shined ; 
Yet after all their proud designs were done , 
His work , to them proved Sisyphus his stone ; 
Still with renowned force , a fresh returning , 
The bush did burn , but did not waste in burning ; 
His despicable Followers , though few , 
The more they were afflicted , more they grew : 
All Proclamation , cruel Prohibitions , 
All Circuit Court's of Spanish Inquisitions , 
( Imposing conscience , cozening Oaths and Bonds , 
Recusants , banishing to Foreign Lands , 
Or Murdering by bloody Butchers hands ) 
could never either yet their cumbers finish , 
Nor so much as their Number yet diminish , 
Nor crush , or cool his unapalled Zeal , 
Nor of his Ministry cancel the Seal , 
Engraven on the hearts of many hearers , 
Who were Iehovah's followers and fearers : 
Which now 's impressed with a deeper stamp , 
Since the expiring of this burning Lamp : 
Whose latest sparklings hath so brightly blazed , 
That many eyes were dazzled and amazed , 
To see now visibly without a cloud , 
( And legibly in Characters of blood ) 
The adversaries tyranny disclosed , 
Their calumnies confute , that him opposed ; 
That those despised truths have overcome , 
For which contending he got Martyrdom . 
His testimony for his Master's Cause , 
The church's Liberties , and Nations Laws ; 
( For which in Life he mightily contended ) 
Now by his Death to many much commended ; 
Who searching what could be the cause , or crime , 
wherefore he lost his Life at such a time ; 
Did find that only he was too distinct 
In speaking that , which many others think . 
This was the only Crime , was on him charged , 
Tho' to the height of hinousness enlarged : 
Because these Soul-enriching Rendezvouse , 
Of Christ's Militia , in the Fields , or House , 
The Devils grand-eye-sore , and great vexation , 
Of all his friends , and foes of Reformation : 
( Where hungry souls with Heavenly food were nourished , 
And where a Banner faithfully was flourished , 
For the Regalia of the Church's Head , 
And Libe●●ies' , wherewith he hath her freed ) 
He never suffer would to be suppressed . 
Nor that the duty should not be confessed ; 
Now when it was declared Capital , 
And when by Law discharged as Criminal ; 
And by its old promoters now deserted , 
Whom Popish Tolerations have perverted : 
In such a case he vigorously contended , 
That Meetings should be valiantly defended , 
By Arms defensive , which the Law of Nature , 
And Law of God , allows to every Creature ; 
When now they were in daily jeopardice , 
Of having blood mixed with their Sacrifice . 
This also was his Crime , or rather Crown , 
That he would not a Popish Monster own ; 
Sitting upon a Throne of Tyranny , 
Usurped by rapine , blood , and treachery ; 
Nor pay alledgiance to his Absolute Power , 
As pimp employed for the Romish whore ; 
Nor say , a Robbers Sacriledgious Rod , 
Was now the Sacred Ordinance of GOD ; 
When such in Sacred writ , is called rather 
A Fox , or Dog , than a Politic Father . 
In fine , for this he also was indyted ; 
Because to bear the Cross he us invited , 
Rather than pay an execrable Cess 
Imposed our Gospel , meettings to suppress , 
For raising Forces Tyranny to strengthen , 
Our much enthraled misery to lengthen , 
For ruin the weak Remnant left devoting , 
The Church and State Supremacy promoting , 
For Tests of lawless Loyalty enacted , 
And for betraying Liberty enacted , 
The full amount then of his Accusation , 
Of all his troubles , the alone occasion , 
Was that at wickedness beed never wink ; 
But still spoke out , what others durst but think : 
From which , unto the death he would not swerve , 
But boldly spoke his mind without reserve , 
To Prelatists , and Papists , in their fury , 
And to Professors sitting on his jury : 
Invincibly he all their tricks withstood , 
Inflexibly resisting unto blood : 
And for his Life to Supplicat disdained , 
lest he should have his Testimony stained 
By which , through blood of Lamb he overcame , 
And loved not Life too dearly for the same : 
Which fruitfully h'affirmed during breath , 
And faithfuly confirmed by his death ; 
●n such a measure of Humility , 
Of Patience , Meekness , Zeal , and Constancy ; 
That it to Enemies hath been confounding , 
To Neutralists conviction much redounding , 
To Hesitants and Halters Confirmation , 
And to all Zions' mourners Consolation . 
Hence in a bloody Chariot he hath gone , 
To see , and stand before , Emmanuel's Throne ; 
His hands with Palms , his head with pleasant Bays , 
His Clotheses in white , do sparkle glistering Rays 
Of Glory ; Glory singing , and salvation 
To Him that brought him out of tribulation ; 
Unto the Throne and Temple of his GOD , 
Where everlasting he hath abode ; 
Where without intermission night or day , 
Where without interruption or delay , 
Without all cares , without all faints or fears , 
Without all snares , without all plaints or tears , 
He serves , he sings , he sees the Lamb that 's feeding , 
And unto Lovely Living Waters leading : 
Where leave we him , full of Iehovah's Joy , 
Whom no more sin , or sorrow , can annoy ; 
And rest lamenting , while in the vale of tears , 
Our growing grief , and fresh recurring fears .
