An exit to the exit Tyrannus : or , upon erasing that ignominious and scandalous motto , which was set over the place where King Charles the first statue stood , in the royal exchange , London . 

To the tune of i made a voyage into France , &c.  

1 

After cursed traitors damned rage 
At length is come that happy age 
Wherein our hopes are crowned , 
Our griefs are turned to joys , and all 
Our miseries and sorrows shall 
Be in canary drowned . 
2 

Thrice happy night which black as thee 
Hast caused that hell black doom to be 
Made by a tyrant crew , 
When to fulfil the devilish lust 
they 'd make it seem both good and just 
That they their sovereign slew . 
3 

'T was not enough with them to draw 
Their sword against the King and law 
To rob and steal and plunder , 
'T was not enough to act all treason 
Pretending still religious reason 
This was in them no wonder . 
4 

'T was not enough they had destroyed 
Our King , to make our name abroad 
A mock and scorn to be , 
But to add further to our shame 
At home they blast his glorious name 
With marks of tyranny . 
5 

Cursed generation of hams tribe 
Their wickedness to him ascribe 
And seek his fame to taint , 
Of whom it justly Might be cried 
He was a martyr when he died 
And whilst he lived a saint . 
6 

To palliate their seditious acts 
They charge him with those odious facts 
Which they themselves commit , 
And 'cause they had by their own fault 
Both church and state to ruin brought 
He must be cause of it . 
7 

exit Tyrannus up they set 
As if the kingdom than did get 
By this their liberty , 
When as indeed from this their crime 
The nation well Might date the time 
Of real tyranny . 
8 

We since have found their zealous tones 
Have caused our true and real groans 
We see their good old cause , 
Was only made for a pretence 
To banish all our freedom hence 
And overthrow our laws . 
9 

Oh Charles that exit which they put 
Up o'er thy statues head was but 
An entrance to our woe , 
That fatal axe which thee divorced 
From us , our happiness hath forced 
Into the grave to go . 
10 

But blessed be providence that we 
This happy night have lived to see 
Wherein for all their spite , 
We see some hope that at the length 
The kingdom May recover strength 
And thou regain thy right . 
11 

Thy fame no more shall be defaced 
But with these glorious titles graced 
Which are due to thy merit , 
Nor shall the babbling rout now dare 
To exclaim against thee in their prayer 
Or curse thee by the spirit . 
12 

Nor is 't our happiness alone 
Thy disgrace is wiped out o' th' stone 
But does proceed yet farther , 
Brave monk has given an exeunt too 
To those these nations did undo 
And did commit thy murder . 
13 

Go on brave George , and as before 
Our nation to her right restore 
Call in the lawful heir , 
Speak but an entrance to our King , 
And none but will thy praises sing 
And bless thee in their prayer . 
Finis .
