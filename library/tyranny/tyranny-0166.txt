Come , come all you that are with Rome offended , 
Come now and hear from whence the Pope descended â–ª 


The lineage of locusts or the Pope's pedegre beginning with his prime ancestor the devil , plainly set forth to be noted of all good Christians and true Catholics , for the avoiding of those subtle snares continually laid for them by his insinuating agents .

The Protestant's conclusion . 

The Pope , himself ( The simple to beguile ) 
servum servorum dei doth instill , 
The servant of God's servants , who ( We find ) 
To seem his Masters better is inclined , 
Christ humble was , humility requiring , 
The Pope is proud to honour still aspiring , 
Christ was content to wear a crown of thorns , 
But the Pope's head a crown of gold adorns , 
A triple crown which hardly him sufficeth 
But of his foul ambition what ariseth ? 
hunc capit infernus , quem deserit ordo supernus . 
Forsaken by the choir supernal , 
he 's taken by the fiends infernal , 
For let false Catholics say what they can 
he 's neither God nor angel , nor a man , 
But a prodigious beast or monster fell 
With all his brood hatched or begot in hell , 
And so i leave him .
