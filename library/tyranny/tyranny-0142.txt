THE DECLARATION OF JAMES DUKE of MONMOUTH , & The Noblemen , Gentlemen & others , now in Arms , for Defence & vindication of the Protestant Religion , & the Laws , Rights , & Privilieges of England , from the Invasion made upon them : & for Delivering the Kingdom from the Usurpation & Tyranny of JAMES DUKE of YORK . 

AS Gouvernment was originally Instituted by God , & this or that form of it chosen and submitted to by M●● , for the peace happiness & security of the Governed , & not for the private Interest , & personal greatness of those that Rule : so that Government hath been always esteemed the host where the supreme Magistrates have been vested with all the power & prerogatives that might Capacitate them , not only to preserve the people from violence & oppression , but to promote their prosperity ; & yet where nothing was to belong to them by the Rules of the Constitution , that might enable them to injure and oppress them . 

And it hath been the Glory of England above most other Nations , that the Prince had all entrusted with him that was necessary either for advanceing the welfare of the people , or for his own protection in the discharge of his Office , & with all stood so limited & restrains by the fundamental Terms of the Constitution , that without a violation of his own Oath , as well as the Rules , & measures of the Government , he could do them no hurt , or exercise any act of Authority , but through the administration of such hands , as stood obnoxious to be punished in case they transgressed . So that according to the primitive Frame of the Government , the prerogatives of the Crown , & privileges of the subject , were so far from justling one another ; that the rights reserved unto the People , tended to render the King honourable & Great ; and the prerogratives settled on the Prince , were in order to the subjects protection & safety . 

But all human things being liable to pervertion , as well as decay ; it hath been the fate of the English Government , to be often changed , & wrested from what it was , in the first setlement & Institution . And we are particularly compelled to say , that all the boundaries of the Government have of late been broken , & nothing left unattempted . for turning our limited Monarchy into an absolute Tyranny . For such hath been the transactions of affairs within this Nation for several Years last passed , that though the Protestant Religion , & Libertyes of the people , were fenced & hedged about , by as many Laws , as the Wisdom of men could device , for their preservation against Popery and Arbitrary Power ; our Religion hath been all a long undermined by Popish Counsels , and our Privileges ravished from us by fraud & violence . And more especially , the whole course & series of the Life of the present Usurper , hath been but one continued conspiracy against the Reform Religion , & rights of the Nation . 

For whosoever considers his contriving the burning of London ; his Instigating a confederacy with France , and a War with Holland ; his somenting the popish Plot ; and encouraging the Murder of Sr. Edmund-bury-godfry to Stifle it ; his forging Treason against protestants ; & suborning witnesses to swear the Patriots of our Religion & liberties out of their Lives ; his hireing execrable Villains to assassinate the late Earl of Essex ; and causing several others to be Claudestinly cut off in hopes to conceal it ; his advising and procuring the Prorogation and Dissolution of Parliaments , in order to prevent enquiry into his Crimes , & that he might escape the justice of the Nation : such can imagine nothing so black and horrid in itself , or so ruinous & destructive to Religion , and the Kingdom , which we may not expect from him , upon his having invaded the Throne ; and usurped the Title of a King. The very Tyrannies which he hath exercised , since he natched the Crown from high Brother's head , do leave none under a possibility of flattering themselves , with hopes of safety either in their consciences , persons , or Estates . 

For in defiance of all the Laws & Statutes of the Realm , made for the security of the Reform Protestant Religion , he not only began his Usurpation and pretended Reign , with a bare faced avowing himself of the Romish Religion , but hath called in muititudes of Priests & jesuits ( for whom the Law makes it treason to come into the Kingdom ) and hath impowered them to exercise their Idolatries , and besides his being daily present at the worship of the Mass , hath publicly assisted at the grossest Fopperios of their superstition . 

Nor hath he been more tender in trampling upon the Laws which Concern our Properties , seeing by two Proclamations , whereof the one requires the collecting of the Customs , & the other the continuing that part of the Excise which was to expire with the late King's death , he hath violently & against all the Laws of the Land broken in upon our Estates . Neither is it any extenuation of his usurpation & Tyranny , that he is countenanced in it by an extra Judicial opinion of seven or eight suborned & forsworn Judges : that rather declaring the greatness and extent of the conspiracy against our Rights , and that there is no means left for our relief , but by force & Arms . For advancing those to the Bench , who were the scandal of the Bar ; and Constituting those very men to deelare the Laws , who were accused & branded in Parliament for perverting them ; We are precluded all hopes of redress in Westminster-hall : and through packing to gather by false returns , new Illegal Charters , & other corrupt means , a company of men which he intends to style a Parliament ; he doth at once deprive us of all expectation of succour , where our Ancestors were wont to find it : and hopes to render that which ought to be the people's fence against Tyranny , & the conservators of their Liberties , the means of subverting all our Laws , & of establishing his Arbitraryness , & confirming our thraldom . So that unless We could be contented to see the reform Protestant Religion , and such as profess it extirpated ; popish superstition and Idolatry established : the Laws of the Land Trampled underfoot ; the Liberties & rights of the English people subverted ; all that is Sacred , and Civil , or of regard amongst men of Piety , or Virtue Violated ; and an Usurper Tyrannising on the Throne : and unless We could be willing to be Slaves as well as Papists ; & forget the example of our noble & generous Ancestors , who conveyed our Privileges to us at the expense of their blood & treasure ; and with all be un mindful of our duty to God , our Country and Posterity ; deaf to the cries & groans of our oppressed Friends ; and be satisfied not only to see them and ourselves Imprisoned , robbed , & murdered ; but the Protestant Interest throughout the whole world , betrayed to France & Rome . We are bound as Men & Christians and that in discharge of our duty to God , & our country , and for fatisfaction of the expectations of the Protestant Nations round about us , to betake ourselves to Arms : which we call Heaven & Earth to witness , we should not have done ; had not the Malice of our Enemies deprived us of all other means of redress , and were not the miseries we already feel , & those which do further threaten us , worse than the Calamities of Warr.  

And it is not for any personal injuries or private discontents , nor in pursuance of any corrupt Interest , that we take our swords into our hands ; but for Vindicating our Religion , Laws , & Rights , and rescueing our Country from ruin & destruction : and for preserving ourselves , Wives & Children , from Bondage & Idolatry ; wherefore before God , Angels , & Men , we stand acquitted from , & do charge upon our Enemies , all the slaughters and devastations , that avoidable accompany a Intestine Warr.  

Now therefore We do hereby solemnly declare & proclaim War against JAMES DUKE of YORK , as a Murderer , and an Assassin of Innocent men ; A Popish Usurper of the Crown ; a Traitor to the Nation ; and Tyrant over the People . And we would have none that appear under his Banners , to statter themselves with expectation of forgiveness ; it being our firm resolution to prosecute him & his adherents , without giving way to Treaties , or Accommodations , until we have brought him , & them , to undergo what the Rules of the Constitution , & the Statutes of the Realm , as well as the Laws of Nature , Scripture , & Nations , adjudge to be the punishment due to the Enemies of God , Mankind , their Country , and all things that are honourable , Virtuous , & good . 

And tho' we cannot avoid being sensible , that too Many have from Cowardice , Covetousness , & Ambition , cooperated to the subverting Religion , & enslaving their Country ; Yet We would have none from a despair of finding Mercy , persever in their Crimes , nor continue to pursue the ruin of the Kingdom . For We Exclude none from the benefit of Repentance , that shall join with us in retreiving what they have been accessary to the loss of ; nor do we design Revenge upon any , but the Obstinate , and such as shall befound at this Juncture , yielding aid & assistance to the said James Duke of York . 

And that We may both Govern ourselves in the pursuit of this Glorious Cause where in We are engaged , and give encouragement to all that shall assist us in so righteous & necessary an Undertaking : We do in the Presence of the Lord who knows the secrets of all hearts , & is the Avenger of Deciept & Falsehood , Proclaim & publish what We aim at , & forth obtaining Where of We have both determined to Venture & are ready to lay down our lives . And tho' We are not come into the Field to Introduce Anarchy & Confusion , or for laying aside any Essential part of the old English Government : Yet our purpose & resolutions are to reduce things to that Temperament & balance , that future Rulers may remain able to do all the good , that can be either desired or expected from them ; and that it may not be in their power to invade the Rights , & infringe the Liberties of the People . 

And Whereas our Religion ( the most Valuable blessing We lay claim unto ) hath been shaken by unjust Laws ; undermined by Popish Councils , and is now in danger to be subverted by a Tyrannous & Idolatrous Usurper . We are therefore resolved to spend our blood for preserving it to ourselves & posterity nor will we lay down our arms , till we seen established & secured , beyond all probability of being supplanted , and overthrown ; and until all the penal Laws against Protestant Dissenters be repealed , and legal provision made against their being disturbed by reason of their Consciences , and for their enjoying an equal Liberty with other protestants . And that the meekness & purity of our Principles , and the moderation & Righteousness of our Ends , may appear unto all men ; We do declare , that we will not make War upon , or destroy Any , for their Religion how false & erroneous soever : so that the very Papists , provided they , Withdraw from the tents of our Enemies and be not found Guilty of Conspiring our destruction , or Abettors of them that seek it , have no thing to fear or apprehend from us , except what may hinder their altering our Laws , & endangering our persons , in the profession of the reform Doctrine , and exercise ofour Christian Worship . 

Our Resolution in the next place is , to maintain all the just Rights & Privileges of Parliament , & to have Parliaments annually chosen & held , & not prorogued , dissolved , or discontinued with in the year before petitions be first answered & Grievances Redressed . 

And seeing many of the miseries under which the Nation doth groan arise from displacing such out of the Number of judges , as would not for promoting popish & arbitrary designs , wrest & misapply the Laws ; and from constituting Corrupt , & Mercenary men in their Room , on purpose to stretch the Laws beyond the Reason and Intention of them , and to declare that for Law which is not : We can neither with silence pass over the mentioning of them , nor should we have peace in ourselves , if we did not endeavour to prevent the like mischiefs in time to come . For by means of Ill men's being advanced to the Bench , and holding their places only durante bene placito , Many persons have been condemned in Exorbitant fines for no Crimes , or for Very small ones ; many statutes made for the safety of the subject , particularly the Habeas Corpus Act , hath been wickedly eluded , to the oppression of Innocent & loyal men ; the Popish Lords that were Impeached in Parliament , for a most Hellish Conjuration , have to the subverting of the rights of the House of Commons , & trampling on the Jurisdiction of the House of Lords , been discharged & set free ; the imposing a malignant Major , & Sherriffes , upon the City of London by fraud & Violence hath been justified , & those who in discharge of their duty opposed it , illegally prosecuted & arbitrarily punished : London , & other Cities & Corporations have been robbed of their Charters , upon unrighteous judgements of pretended forfeitures ; Sr. Thomas Armstrong executed , with out being allowed the benefit of a Trial ; Colonel Algernon Sidney condemned to die upon the deposition of one scandalous Witness : And that loyal & excellent person the late William Lord Russell murdered , for alleged crimes , in reference to which , if all had been truth that was sworn against him , yet there was nothing that according to Law could have reached his life : wherefore we do upon the considerations a foresaid further declare , that we will have care taken for the future , for debarring ignorant , scandalous , & mercenary men from the Administration of justice , and that the judges shall hold their places by the ancient tenure of quam diu se bene gesserint , and do leave it to the wisdom of a Parliement , to settle some way & method , for the approbation of such as shall be advanced to the degree & dignity of judges . 

And for as much as the invasion made upon the rights of Cities , Burrougheses , & Towns corporate , in the seizure of their charters , whether by surrender , or upon pretence of forfeiture , hath been wholly arbitrary & illegal : We likewise therefore declare , that we will to our utmost endeavour to see them repossessed in whatsoever they formerly had , & could legally claim before the late Usurpation upon them ; and that we do esteem all judgements given against them , & all Surrenders made by a corrupt & perjured party amongst themselves , hey-boyss & void in Law ; and do hold & declare their old charters ( norwithstanding the new ones lately granted ) to be good & valid : And accordingly We de invite & encourage all honest Burgesses , & Freemen , to reassume the Rights & Privileges , which by virtue of the said old charters belonged to their several & respective corporations , and to deliver themselves from those Court Parasites , & instruments of tyranny , set up to oppress them . 

more over for restoring the Kingdom to its primitive condition of Freedom & safety : We will have the corporation , & militia Acts , repealed , and all Outlawries of treason , against any person whatsoever upon the late pretended Protestant plot reversed ; and also all other outlawries , banishments , warrants , judgements , imprisonments , abjurations & proceedings , against any other persons , upon any of the penal statutes made against Protestant dissenters , reversed & made hey-boyss & void ; and We will have new Laws enacted , for placing the Election of Sherriffes in the Freeholders of the several Counties ; and for settling the Militia in the respective Sheriffs , and for preventing all military standing Force except what shall be raised & kept up , by Authority & consent of Parliament . 

And whereas several Gentlemen , & others , who have been worthy & zealous astertors of the Protestant Interest , & laws of the Kingdom , are now in custody in divers prisons within the Realm , upon most unjust accusations , pretences , proceedings , & judgements ; We do hereby further declare their said imprisonments to be Illegal , and that in Case any violence shall be offered to them , or any of them , We will revenge it to the utmost , upon such of our Enemies as shall fall into our hauds . 

And whereas the said James Duke of York , in order to the expediting the Idolatrous & bloody designs of the Papists , the gratifying his own boundless ambition after a Crown , and to hinder enquiry into his Assassination of Arthur Earl of Essex , hath poisoned the late King , and there in manifested his ingratitude , as well as Cruelty , to the world , in murdering a Brother , who had almost ruined himself to preserve & protect him from punishment : We do therefore further declare , that for the aforesaid Villainous and unnatural Crime , & other his crimes before mentioned , and in pursuance of the Resolution of both Houses of Parliament , who Voted to revenge the King's Death , in Case he came to an untimely end ; We will prosecute the said James Duke of York , till We have brought him to suffer , what the Law adjudged to be the punishment of so execrable a fact . And in a more particular manner , his Grace the Duke of Monmouth , being deeply sensible of that barbarous & horrid parricide committed upon his Father , doth resolve to pursue the said James Duke of York , as a mortal and bioudy Enemy , and will endeavour as well with his own hand , as by the assistance of his Friends , & the Law , to have justice executed upon him . 

And forasmuch as the said James Duke of Monmouth , the now Head & Captain General of the Protestant forces of this Kingdom assembled in pursuance of the Ends aforesaid ; hath been , & still is believed , to have a legitimate , & Legal right , to the Crowns of England , Scotland , France & Ireland , with the Dominions there unto belonging , of which he doubts not in the least , to give the world full satisfaction notwithstanding the means used by the late King his Father , upon popish motives , & at the instigation of the said James Duke of York , to weaken & obscure it ; The said James Duke of Monmouth from the generousness of his own nature , and the Love he bears to these nations , ( whose welfare & setlement he infinitely prefers , to whatsoever may concern himself , ) doth not at present insist upon his Title , but leaves the determination thereof to the wisdom , justice , & authority of a Parliament , legally chosen & acting with freedom . And in the time mean doth promise & declare by all that is sacred , that he will in conjunction with the People of England , Employ all the Abilities bestowed upon him by God & Nature , for the reestablishment & preservation of the Protestant reform Religion in these Kingdoms , and for restoring the Subjects of the same , to a free exercise thereof , in opposition to Popery , & the consequences of it , Tyranny & Slavery ; To the obtaining of which ends , he doth hereby promise , & oblige himself to the people of England , to consent unto , & promote the passing into Laws , all the methods aforesaid ; that it may never more be in the power of any single person on the Throne , to deprive the subjects of their Rights , or subvert the fundimentall Laws of the Government designed for their preservation . 

And Whereas the Nobility , Gentry , & Commons of Scotland , are now in arms , upon the like motives , & Inducements that we are , & in prosecution of ends agreeable with ours ; We do therefore approve the justice of their cause , commend their Zeal & Courage , expecting their , & promiseing our Assistance , for carrying on that glorious work we are jointly engaged in . 

Being obliged for avoiding tediousness , to omit recounting many Oppressions under which the Kingdom hath groaved , & the giving a Deduction of the several Steps that have been taken for introducing & establishing of popery & Tyranny : We think fit therefore to signify , both to our Country men , & Foreigners , that We intent , a larger Manifesto , & Remonstrance of the Grievances , Persecutions , Crueltyes & Tyrannies , We have of late laid under , and therein a more full & particular account of the Unparralleled Crimes of the present Usurper . 

And We make our appeal unto God , & all protestants Kings , Princes , States , & People , concerning the justice of our Cause , and the necessity we are reduced unto , of having our recourse to Arms . And as we do beseech require & adjure all sincere protestants , and true Englishmen , to be assisting to us against the Enemies of the Gospel , Rights of the Nation , and liberties of mankind ; so we are confident of obtaining the ut av-s_d aid & succour which they can yield us with their Prayers , persons , & Estates , for the Dethroning the said Tyrant & Popish Usurper . 

Nor do We doubt being justified , contenanced , & assisted , by all Protestant Kings , Princes , & common Wealths , Who do either regard the Gospel of Jesus Christ , or their own Interest : and above all our dependence & trust is upon the Lord of hosts , in whose name We go forth , & to whom we commit our cause , and refer the dicision betwixt us & our Enemies in the Day of Battle . Now let us play the men , for our People , & for the Cities of our God , and the Lord do that which seemeth good unto him .
