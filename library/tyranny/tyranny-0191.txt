the reresurrection of the rump : or , rebellion and tyranny revived . The third edition . 

To the tune of the blacksmith . 

If none be offended with the scent , 
Though i foul my mouth , I 'll be content , 
To sing of the rump of a parliament , 
which no can deny . 
I have sometimes fed on a rump in souse , 
And a man May imagine the rump of a louse ; 
But till now was ne'er heard of the rump of a house , 
which no can deny . 
there 's a rump of beef , and the rump of a goose , 
And a rump whose neck was hanged in a noose ; 
But ours is a rump can play fast and loose , 
which no can deny . 
A Rump had Jane Shore , and a rump messaleen , 
And a rump had Antony's resolute Queen ; 
But such a rump as ours is , never was seen , 
which no can deny . 
Two short years together we English have scarce 
Been rid of thy rampant nose ( Old Mars ) 
But now thou hast got a prodigious arse , 
which no can deny . 
When the parts of the body did all fall out , 
Some votes it is like did pass for the snout ; 
But that the rump should be King was never a doubt , 
which no can deny . 
A cat has a rump , and a cat has nine lives , 
Yet when her heads off , her rump never strives ; 
But our rump from the grave hath made two retrieves , 
which no can deny . 
That the rump May all their enemies quail , 
they 'll borrow the devil's coat of mayl , 
And all to defend their estate in tail , 
which no can deny . 
But though their scale now seem to be the upper , 
there 's no need of the charge of a thanksgiving supper , 
For if they be the rump , the army 's their crupper , 
which no can deny . 
There is a saying belongs to the rump , 
Which is good , although it be worn to the stump , 
That on the buttocks I 'll give thee a thump 
which no can deny . 
there 's a proverb in which the rump claims a part , 
Which hath in it more of sense than of art , 
That for all you can do , i care not a fart , 
which no can deny . 
there 's another proverb gives the rump for his crest , 
But alderman Atkins made it a jest , 
That of all kind of luck's , shitten luck is the best , 
which no can deny . 
There is another proverb that never will fail , 
That the good the rump will do when they prevail , 
Is to give us a flop with a fox-tail , 
which no can deny . 
There is a saying which is made by no fools ; 
I never can hear on 't but my heart it cools , 
That the rump will spend all we have in close stools 
which no can deny . 
there 's an observation wise and deep , 
Which without an onion will make me to weep ; 
That flies will blow maggots in the rump of a sheep , 
which no can deny . 
And some that can see the wood from the trees , 
Say this sanctified rump in time we May lose ; 
For the cooks do challenge the rumps for their fees . 
which no can deny . 
When the rump do sit we will make it our moan , 
That a reason be  Nacted if there be not one , 
Why a fart hath a tongue , and a fyest hath none ? 
which no can deny . 
And whilst within the walls they lurk , 
To satisfy us , will be a good work ; 
Who hath most religion , the rump , or the Turk , 
which no can deny . 
A Rump's a fag-end , like the balk of a furrow , 
And is to the whole like the jail to the burrow ; 
't is the bran that is left , when the meal is run through 
which no can deny . 
Consider the world , the heaven is the head on 't , 
The earth is the middle , and we men are fed on 't ; 
But hell is the rump , and no more can be said on 't . 
which no can deny . 
flectere si nequeunt superos achaeronta movebunt . 

Finis , in English , the rump .
