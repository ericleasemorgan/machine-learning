Love's Tyranny : OR , Death more welcome than Disdain . 

Being the Tragedy of Leander for the Love of Roxane . 

Lovers beware , for in Loves Smiles the fates , 
To Ruin two Adventurous Mortals waitss ; 
Women like Sirens , first with Charms allure , 
Until they Wound , then leave us without Cure : 
Such fate Leander found'st , and for disdain , 
took Death's kind portion , which expelled his pain : 
To the Tune of , Let the Critics Adore , etc.  







AH ! how drousie's the Skies , 
Now black Night does arise 
From the Ocean ; 
And all the bright Fires , 
Seem void of desires , 
And of motion : 
While my flames I do discover , 
love charges my Breast , 
O the Nymph there does hover , 
that 's my portion of Rest : 
they 're creating a Desire , 
and such hopes of a Bliss , 
As my thoughts do inspire , 
She does leave me confined , 
And as swift as the Wind , 
she does fly me ; 
Whilst here all alone , 
I do breath my sad moan , 
she does try me : 
Melted in favours of Passion , 
like a Phoenix I 'm fried , 
So beyond alteration , 
my fierce Torments abide : 
And I strait am made Fuel , 
to the Beams of her eyes , 
Till each moment she grows cruel , 
and my Flame does despise 
The second Part , 

to the same Tune . 

While the beauteous fair , 
Does wound with despair , 
I must perish , 
Unless her bright face , 
Will yield my Love place , 
for to Cherish : 
Oh! her Angel-bright beauty , 
does so Charm with Delight , 
That I think it my Duty , 
through the shadows of night : 
For to follow her flying , 
I , and sadly complain , 
And implore her , still sighing , 
for to ease my great pain . 
And when Purple morning , 
The Skies is adorning , 
each Meander , 
Of the wide Grove , 
I importune for Love , 
and do wander : 
While as Echo replies , 
with a doleful harsh sound , 
Thy Roxane she now fly's , 
which like death's shafts wound : 
So that still she 's Creating 
a Composser of Fate , 
Which surpasses the relating 
the wonders so great . 
O I fear some one sips , 
From her fair Coral Lips , 
the sweet Necture , 
While I sigh here in vain , 
And to Woods do complain , 
I neglect her : 
Once more I 'll arise , 
from my mournful cold Bed , 
Though with Charms that surprise , 
she does strike me for dead : 
I 'll press on to those pleasures , 
though I perish in Love , 
Oh! those sacred Treasures , 
do so powerful prove . 
I 'll no longer despair , 
Thus tormented with care , 
and sad Fancies , 
But clasped in her Arms , 
There I 'll perish with Charms , 
and with Glances : 
O 't is better to be Dying , 
then continually grieve , 
Or at least for to be trying , 
she perhaps may relieve 
This so woeful disaster , 
that Love hath now wrought , 
Or to drive an fate faster , 
while to moan I am taught . 
Or before 't is too late , 
I 'll revive my sad state , 
ever I slumber , 
And in Death's cold shade , 
For Ages an laid , 
without number : 
But OH what now appears , 
from yond Cypress Grove , 
How revived are my fears , 
't is the Queen of my Love : 
Ah! where fleets thou my joy , 
what a vision was this , 
So soon gone , to destroy 
my short fancy of Bliss . 
Oh! make room in the shades , 
Lovers Ghosts for life fades , 
and is flying ; 
Oh! I 'll not always hear , 
This Eternal despair , 
to be dying : 
then he drew his keen sword , 
and cried thus with a wound , 
I 'll a Cure now afford , 
that Appollone'r found : 
Oh! then into that Breast , 
which Death could ne'er fright , 
The fatal steel pressed , 
and his soul took flight .
