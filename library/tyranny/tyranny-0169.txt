An express from the knights and gentlemen now engaged with Sir George Booth ; to the city and citizens of London , and all other freemen of England . 

Worthy citizens and all other our English freemen and brethren , 

As we are Englishmen we are all incorporated into one body , and though distinct and different families , fortunes , and qualities , yet fellow members and coheirs of one and the same birthright ; not only by nature , as we are the sons of men , ( Nature obliging all in one common and equal bond of freedom and unity , ) but by certain sacred laws and customs of peculiar and inherent right to this nation ; general , equal , and impartial to all , without respect of persons , rank , quality , or degree ; derived through all successions of ages , by the blood , justice and prudence of our forefathers to us their posterity , as ours , and the right of our children after us , not disinheritable : though this age were wholly made up of apostates and traitors to common justice and freedom , and should make sale of , and deliver up their children as slaves and vassals , yet English right abideth , to wit our just laws and liberties , and May justly be reinforced as opportunity May present ; sometime they sleep but never die , their total extinguishment is not to be imagined so long as any Englishman or english-blood abideth : and whoever undertaketh , ( Though by arms or otherwise ) their recovery and redemption is justified in that very action by the laws of God , of nations , nature , reason , and by the laws of the land , and within the bowels of our nation amongst ourselves no war can be justified , but upon that score , the contrary is sedition , murder , treason , tyranny and what not , and the instruments thereof no other in the eye of English freedom and right , but as bears , wolves , and other beasts of prey . 

Now right worthy and noble citizens , and all other our English brethren , let us consider and lay to heart the sad and deplorable condition of our native country : oppression , injustice , and tyranny reigneth ; division , discord and dissimulation fomented and fostered ; trade and industry discouraged , our land rent into parties and factions , and the common band of unity canceled , our fundamental laws supplanted , high courts of justice introduced , the blood of war shed in times of peace ; arbitrary and illegal imprisonments , patents , monopolies , excise , and other payments brought upon us , and continue contrary to magna charta , and the petition of right ; no form or face of government of English constitution amongst us ; the name and authority of the persons in parliament usurped and abused , and the stamp thereof put upon strange and prodigious actions , vexing and oppressing the persons with daily changes and alterations in government , as the interest of some few ambitious grandees alter and change , or get advantages one of another , and all under the name of a commonwealth , when as the nature is not practised or intended at all , it being utterly inconsistent with their very temper and interest ; they are wrapped up and compounded of nothing but gild , blood and tyranny ; and equal and common justice ( The essence of a commonwealth ) are utterly repugnant thereto ; and whatsoever they can do must be planted and maintained by sword and violence against the very heart and sense of the nation ; and they know not where nor how to centre an oligarchy or something they would have to be Masters of the persons , and perpetuate their power and tyranny , and therefore would amaze and confound us with their new debates of a coordinate power or senate for life , such as our English laws and liberties know not of , and of pernicious consequence to this nation ; so that from these men that thus handle the stern at Westminster , there is no expectation of any just settlement of peace or freedom from oppression ; especially considering the apostasy , hypocrisy , deceit and perjury of those men , their manifold solemn engagements , oaths , vows , protestations , appeals unto heaven , promises , remonstrances , declarations all by them broken again and again , never keeping faith , truce or oath , being unbounded , unlimited , certain to nothing , not to be held either by the law of God , of man , of conscience or reason ; and from such persons in government good Lord deliver us , and all the good persons in England ; and that all this is true of them , your consciences noble citizens , and all other the free persons of England can witness , there is no tongue , no pen is able to vindicate them in this point , it is known of all , owned by all , and can be denied by none ; how then can any honest or just man shed any blood in their quarrel , or lend them assistance ? surely that blood will be required at their hands , and we doubt not but you will be careful what you do . 

And therefore from those considerations and just provocations we have taken up arms in pursuance of , and inquisition after our government , laws , and liberties , that every Englishman May be protected , and secured in his religion , liberty , and property ; and though it May be suggested , that we intend to introduce persecution for conscience into the land again , we do hereby ( In the presence of almighty God ) protest and declare against all coercive power in matters of religion , and that to the utmost of our strength ( Through God's assistance ) we will endeavour to the hazard of our blood and fortunes the freedom and protection of all virtuous and religious persons , by what name soever differenced from us , equal with ourselves : and that no foreign or other authority save only the civil be exercised in England : that the practice of the law be reform ; all corrupt statutes repealed ; annual elections of all officers and magistrates , with the constant succession of parliaments restored ; our fundamental laws cleared and asserted , and whatever is contrary thereto be abolished : that no trials be admitted in England for life , limb , liberty or estate but by the good old way of juries , and that they be restored to their original power and purity : that all extrajudicial and illegal proceedings by high-courts of justice , or otherwise , with all illegal and arbitrary committees be strictly provided against : that the excise , and all other payments and taxes such as our ancestors never knew of , together with all monopolies and patents destructive to trade and the common good of the nation be also abolished : and , that our parliaments and magistrates be secured from all force and violence ; and utterly cleared from all boundless prerogative , and unlimited privilege : that the right of the poor in the Commons of England , all donations for charitable uses , and all lands formerly belonging to the persons be restored again : and that mercy and justice be truly established amongst us . And for these ends and what else May be of public good to the nation , we do desire , and indeed challenge as of English right , the speedy election of a new free parliament . 

And thus , most noble citizens , brethren and fellow freemen of England , we have dealt truly and plainly with you , and given you the real grounds and reasons of our taking up arms ; looking upon you as the most concerned in the nation , and therefore hold ourselves the more obliged to give you this early advice of our candid and just intentions in this undertaking , that you May not be deluded or frighted ( Though falsely ) into any strange opinion of us , either through your own mistake , or by the policy of those men who will leave no means unattempted to render us as public enemies , rebels and traitors , plunderers , tyrants and persecutors , or what ever is odious and monstrous , to engage you in blood . 

Believe us , right worthy citizens , and freeborn English brethren , we have no design of fire or sword , or evil toward you or your city ; or any part of the nation , or any person in it : we know there are thousands amongst you that are satisfied in us ; it May be indeed that many or most of the gathered separate churches May be fearful and jealous of us , and so May be induced to arms against us ; but we do again and again protest before almighty God , and the whole world , that we have no other purpose towards them , but that they with us , and we with them , May be bound up as friends and brethren in the common cause of our country , that every Englishman May have English freedom and right ; and we do not desire to wrong either man , woman or child the worth of a shoe-latchet : therefore we hope you will first well advise before you proceed in a new war , lest you bring not only your own , but others blood on your heads ( For we are resolved to prosecute this to the last drop of our blood . ) The case of England is laid before you , our laws and liberties , they are yours as well as ours , and for which we have all engaged in the first war , and not to be so slightly valued as to be set at stake against the private ends of some ambitious and corrupt persons : salus populi , suprema lex ; let the persons live , and their enemies perish . 

Therefore we beseech you , we conjure you as Englishmen , to stand by your native country , and your country's cause : our voice is , and it is no other than the consent and voice of the persons , a new free parliament , a new free parliament ; it is the Englishman's main birthright , which we are resolved to put the persons in possession of , or to perish with our swords in our hands . But if you will not join , but degenerate , we hope notwithstanding ( By God's blessing ) to carry on this work : yet to that just and glorious work we May challenge your concurrence , it being your duty as well as ours to endeavour the procurement thereof and therefore to you make it our proposal , to your militia , to the army , and the whole persons , for the prevention of a new war , and the effusion of English blood , that you would be instrumental with us for the speedy election of a new free parliament , for the ends aforesaid ; and in the interim all hostility to be forborn ; and that a day May be appointed , and the persons suffered to go to their free elections , and we shall quietly submit to their authority ; heartily desiring all revenge , division , rancour , and animosity of spirit May be for ever buried in one general act of oblivion ; and that all parties , sects , and sorts ( Now jarring , and making up interests one against another ) May reconcile , cement , and concentre in the common brotherhood of English freedom and right ; in and for which we are .
