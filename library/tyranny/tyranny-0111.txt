These things were upon me , to deliver even by speech and word of mouth to the present men in power , that they Might be warned lest they perish ; but no way being made for me so to do , i have written what was upon me , even as short as possibly i could , and in as little compass as Might be , having hinted at things which Might more largely been spoken to ; and i order this to be printed and given to their particular hands , with speed . 

E. b.  

To the present rulers of England , a message to you all , by an ambassador from the Lord God , the great and mighty King ; and Jesus Christ , the only Prince of peace and righteousness , whose right alone , it is to rule , over us in our nation , and not another's , in his name and authority , i am come unto you . 

friends , my Master is a high and mighty , and powerful Prince , and very honourable ; and fear , reverence , respect and subjection belongs to him alone , from you and all mankind , he is wise and understanding , and of great strength : and his dominion is from everlasting to everlasting ; and he can do whatsoever he will in heaven and earth ; for he rules with his iron rod over the world , and whatsoever he saith , it is done ; for his word is an everlasting command ; if he say to a man live , it is so ; and if he say to him die , it cometh to pass ; and if he give peace to a man or a nation , none can make war ; and if he make war with a person , or in a nation , no man is able to make peace . For why , he hath all power in his hand , and to him all judgement and authority is given , he is the son of the living God , the everlasting creator ; he was , and is , and is to come ; his eye beholdeth all things , and his arm compasseth heaven and earth ; and what his purpose is , he hath always , and will ever bring it to pass ; if he set up rulers , they must rule ; and if he pull them down , none can hinder ; whom he will he honoureth , and if it be his pleasure , he bringeth men to shame ; if he break a nation down , none can build it up ; and if he confound powers and authorities in the kingdoms of men , they all fall as withered grass before him ; behold ye men ! he is so great and mighty , and of so great authority , that whatsoever he saith , it is done , and whatsoever he willeth , it cometh to pass ; and none is able to resist him and overcome his power ; when his pleasure is to accomplish a work ; by him all things are that be , and all things live that hath life , and through him all things moveth , and of his fullness every creature in heaven and earth receiveth ; and this my Master is altogether honourable in birth and otherwise ; and altogether mighty in all his works ; he is just and merciful , full of goodness , righteousness and truth , and all virtue dwells in him : and his judgement and mercy , his authority and meekness : and his wrath and his love , they are companions ; and what are ye before him ? or how shall ye be able to resist him ? or to turn backward what his purpose is concerning you and this nation ? for ye have no being nor breath without him . Behold ye men ; ye are verily as the dust before the wind , so are ye to him soon blown away , and your place not found , as the grass before the mower , so are ye before him , soon cut down and withered , and your beauty utterly extinguished , as a potter's vessel under an iron rod , even so are you to him , he can immediately break you , never to be bound up , as a drop to the fountain , so are you to him , soon dried up , and made nothing ; wherefore ye men , ye mortal creatures , ye ignorant persons , sons of a transgressor , ye dust and ashes ; for thus you are in comparison of him this mighty Prince ; hearken to his message which cometh to you from him : hear and fear , and be not stouthearted against the Lord God that is about to speak unto you . 

As for this little island of England , wherein your present place and being is ; it is an island which the Lord hath showed great favour unto , in ages past , and in this present time : and i must tell you he hath a purpose of love towards it , and to honour it in the view of the world , though through great tribulations , and he hath an intent of great good unto it : for he hath a seed , a precious seed in it , scattered abroad , and he hath a persons that fears his name , and hath walked in his ways , and he hath made them , and elected them , and what they are , it is by him : that he May dwell among them , and have the whole government over them all , yea , he hath a speedy purpose verity concerning this nation , and he will purify it in judgement , and refine its inhabitants through the fire of tribulations , that it May be pleasant to him , and fit to do his will : he hath a purpose to work some great thing in it i must tell you , as he hath said unto me , so to do ; he will have his name exalted and reverenced in this island , and his terror shall be sent out of it through the world , and his branch from it shall spread over the earth , he doth purpose in his season to take it into his own hand , and to sway the government thereof with his own sceptre , and to set up righteousness alone , and to overthrow all oppressions and oppressors , and the kingdoms of this world must become the kingdoms of the Lord , and of his christis . 

True it is , such hath been the coming to pass of time , and of things for many ages by-past , that my Master hath been as it were banished from the nation , and hath not been suffered to enjoy his right , but hath been expelled , even as it were by the force of Satan , and Antichrist , who hath long usurped authority over the inhabitants of this nation ; and in my Master's absence , lamentable injustice , cruelty , unmercifulness , tyranny and oppression , hath been exercised upon the inhabitants , and the poor creatures hath been held in great slavery by their rulers , that have ruled by the dragon's power , and been kept in great blindness and ignorance , and under great oppression both in body and spirit , by Antichristian teachers , for this many years , even while the great King hath been absent , and as it were gone into a far country : even all this time hath Antichrist and the devil ruled and reigned , and hath made and executed oppressing and tyrannical laws and decrees , both in church and state , and all the nation hath been out of right order , and laid waste and barren of good fruit , and it hath been as a wilderness , by reason hereof ; and men that have ruled for many years , have not ruled singly by my Master's authority , but by another power , though not without the knowledge of my Lord , neither as though he had not power to have done otherwise ; but for his own pleasure he hath suffered it thus to be , and let men go on to rule and govern in their own wills , and after their own lusts ; and persons have walked wickedly towards him , and towards one another , and all this he hath suffered , not as if he gave toleration for it : for his messengers now and then , and his witness in people's consciences , have been reproving their ungodly ways , and he hath often showed his dislike by divers ways and tokens , and many judgments and strange overturning : to the way and proceeding of both rulers , prophets and teachere of this nation : but yet they have gone on , against his mind , and contrary to his will , notwithstanding his reproofs and judgements , not that he had not power to have executed his pleasure in wrath upon them , and to have destroyed them all together , and have made the nation a heap , and as nothing , long before this day : for power was in his hand to have done it : but he hath been long-suffering , and of great patience , and born all things , and taken the injustice , and cruelty , and wickedness , and idolatry , and all unrighteousness that hath abounded in the nation upon himself , and suffered under it , and born it for its season , while woeful and lamentable oppressions hath been practised in civil state , even hellish laws , and devilish executors of them , merciless tyrants have born the sceptre , and reigned for many years over the inhabitants , and in church and state , hath been heinous idolatry , and superstitious vanities committed in a high nature , and measure , and even all men , and states of men , & orders of men , of every degree , hath been abominably corrupted , in the fight of my Lord ; even from the Prince to the beggar , even rulers and subjects , teachers and persons , judges and prophets , they have been corrupted both in heart and hand , and they have dealt falsely , and wickedly towards him , and towards one another , even to the great displeasure and vexation of him , and his blessed spirit , and to the high provocation of him , to their own destruction , if his long suffering had not prevailed , and all this , while he hath laid , as it were asleep , and at rest in himself , and he hath left men to try them , what they will do , and he hath given them a day , many Kings and rulers , he hath let them have a little time , to see how they would use it , but they have abused it , and not ruled for him , nor accomplished his work , nor fulfilled his will , but acted even in defiance of him , and of his power , and to his great dishonour , alack ! I must be plain with you , my Lord hath been utterly exiled , and greatly dishonoured , and highly provoked and vexed , by reason of such proceedings , as hath been in this nation for this many years , through the corruption of all sorts of men in place , and power , who hath not ruled for him , but for the devil , to their own corrupted ears , only he hath suffered men to go on in their course for a season , some as it were appearing on the stage for a time , and suddenly cast down again , for their iniquities sake , and his hand hath been in all these things , though very privately and secretly , not known and discerned by the sons of men , yet hath he ruled over the kingdoms of men , and pulled down one and set up another , and to forbear the several actings and proceedings of many by-passed ages , and to come to this generation , and to speak of things that have happened within these few years , and of the changing and overturning that hath happened in this nation ; such was the cruelty , tyranny , and oppression , and idolatry , both in church and civil state , that the persons of this nation were held under , in the days of papal-power , such i say , was the exceeding height of cruelty , and tyranny of that time , that not any that feared or reverenced my Lord , in any measure could scarce live , or have a being in the nation , even against every man , that did but incline towards him , and desire the knowledge of his ways , hell's mouth was opened against them , and they were swallowed up , and many of their lives taken from the earth , by the hellish power that had in that day usurped authority in this island , and when thus it was , than he looked down from heaven , and his bowels of compassion were opened , for the sake of the oppressed persons that desired after him , in so much that he broke , and threw down the power of their oppressors in some measure , as it stood in papal-authority , and when the iniquity of that power was filled up , he took vengeance upon it ▪ and i must tell you , it was he that brought it about , even the destroying of that power in this nation , and freeing the nation from it , though the men that were instruments in the cause were not his servants , otherwise then as Nabuchadnezzar served him , for he hath a secret way to have a service from the wicked , and such is his power , that he can turn the wickedness of the wicked to his glory , and he can make a rod to whip his adversaries , and burn it when he hath done , and he hath often destroyed one wickedness by another . Well , but to leave that , though he did in some measure free this nation from much tyranny and cruelty , in the casting out popish authority , yet alack the nation in a few years was near as much violated by injustice , tyranny , and cruelty , under the prelatical power , as ever it was once under the papal power , though before there had been some small reformation , and change in outward appearance , though little in ground and nature , yet oppression , and tyranny in civil state , and idolatry , and superstition in church and state , and all profaneness and wickedness among persons , was grown so high , like as it had been under the papal power before , and all that desired after the Lord , and was weary of iniquity , and of the then present oppressions and idolatries , were persecuted , and slain , and destroyed , and injustice and cruelty exercised upon them , even almost to the rooting out of righteousness , and to the grieving of the Lord's spirit ▪ well then , because of the cry of the persons , and the oppression of the nation under that authority , my Lord looked down again , and even for his name sake , and his seeds sake , he had compassion on this nation , to set it free , and to break off its oppressions , and by his hidden hand and secret power , he overthrew that oppressing power of Kings , Lords , and Bishops , both in church , and civil state , and brought some tyrants and oppressors to just execution , for their wickedness and in a great measure , he did deliver the persons of this nation in many things , and there was a part of reformation wrought , and much pretended and looked for , and all this came to pass through him , and my Lord did accomplish it , however the instruments by which he wrought proved deceitful , and became oppressors , as others before them , and though there was in this nation a day of great troubles , and wars , and contention , and great strife , and the wasting of much blood , and earthly treasure , and none of these things i must tell you , fell without the ordering of my Master's hand , yet so it was , and came to pass , that after this nation was restored to peace ; though much unrighteousness , and injustice was removed , yet there was much also left behind , and men that he had used as instruments in his hand in a good work , and to whom he had given wisdom , and understanding , and appeared in much mercy , and in great deliverance , yet they even turned to seek themselves , and became corrupted in the spoils of their enemies , and when peace , and plenty abounded , the Lord was forgotten again , and then the land fell under oppressors , and began again to cry out for freedom , even when other horns of the first beast sprang up , and went one each of them after his fellow , and though one horn hath striven to break another , yet after one hath been cast down , another hath risen , and made an image to the first , and ruled and reigned by the same spirit and authority derived from the dragon's power , in cruelty and oppression , and made laws and executed them , to the dishonour of the Lord , and to the great oppression of his persons , and to the filling of this island with injustice and cruelty , even from one generation to another , until this day , and thus up and down , hath times and seasons been altered , power and authority changed , and altered , statutes , laws , and decrees , changeable , and alterable , for as the iniquity of one power was filled up , that was cast down , and another had its day , till the measure of the first was also finished , that he Might partake of the same judgments , and in all these overturnings , breakings down , and overthrowings , the very hand of my Lord hath been , though secretly , and not discerned , yet his power hath brought about , and suffered all these things to come to pass , and who shall charge him with injustice ? or who shall say what hast thou done ? or why hast thou done it ? for as i have said , he is a high and mighty Prince , and can do whatsoever he will ; and he is the supreme power and authority which rules and reigns in , and over all the kingdoms of men ; and what though he hath used wicked men , as an instrument to accomplish his work , and made the wicked his rod , and even brought it to pass , that one wickedness should destroy another , and one oppressor break down another , and the kingdom of Antichrist confound its self , yet what of all these things ? all flesh must be silent before him , and all persons , and the whole earth must be subject unto him , for the government and dominion over heaven and earth are his , and all power and dominion belongs to him alone , and all judgement is in his hand , to bring to pass whatsoever he will , and by whomsoever , as he pleaseth . 

But now my friends , though i would not be tedious to you , yet must i tell you the truth , and faithfully deliver the Lord's message unto you : and as concerning this last overturning , there was something of the hand of my Lord in it ; and he can , and will bring forth his own work and praise by it , and it shall be for the good of all his persons that waits upon him , though there was much ambition and corrupted ends in the instruments , and neither part were perfectly single to the Lord in their proceedings ; but their work was tasted with the false idolatrous spirit of self-seeking : yet notwithstanding the Lord May bring forth his government , and his pleasant plant , through and beyond all this , even out of another root , which yet appears not among either of them , and righteousness May arise in the nation contrary to both of them , out of another stem , and he will set up his kingdom , and in the mean time leave one potsherd of the earth to break another . And as for you that now sits on the throne and bears rule , whether committee of safety ( So called ) chiefly , though it is not without my Master , for he hath the knowledge of it , at least , yet you are not the only men of his choice , truly called of him to the place of government , neither is your government the government of the lamb , neither must it be for ever established by him ; its foundation is not blessed , nor can its building be prosperous : for why ? alas , it is but another horn of that fourth beast , that hath been made to rule over the world , and upon the earth for many generations , and it is but hitherto a very little refined from the last , and is of the last , even as the eight was of the seventh , spoken of by that servant rev. 17.11 . and it May also make war with the lamb and his followers for a little season , and it May have a small measure of injustice , and persecution to bring forth in the land , even till the words of God be fulfilled , and his kingdom be fully come ; the way of which is but yet a preparing by all these overturnings : and this your present government originally is leavened with the spirit of the old dragon , that hath killed the saints , and drunk their blood , and how should the Lord establish it ? Nay , your kingdom May prove but small and little , and full of uproars , and troubles , and little peace , and satisfaction , and establishment in it to yourselves , nor the persons under you ; but confusion will attend it , and fear will compass it about : though this i must tell you , as you are men , you have your day of trial , what you will do , as many others have had before you , and something you May and aught to do , if but to make the whore ( The false church ) more naked , and to scourge her , more than some others have done ; and indeed my Lord requires something more of you ( As such ) to do , than others before you could do , and you have a price put into your hands which you May improve to the Lord's honour , and to the nations good , and to our own happiness ; which if you be faithful to the Lord to do what he requires of you , and if you become meek and humble men and fear his name , and deny yourselves , and not seek your own honours , nor any earthly advantage to yourselves ; if you do thus , than my Lord will show mercy to you , and you shall not suddenly fall before your enemies , though many May rise up against you ; but your days shall be lengthened , and the purpose of the Lord May be turned to your longer continuance , and not to your sudden destruction , and if you walk in this way , and rule , only for the Lord , then shall you be honoured as men , if not as an authority , and you and the nation preserved in peace , and the force of the wicked shall be turned backward , and you shall not suddenly fall . And the late sundry overturnings in this nation May be examples to you , that you follow not the steps of those that God hath cast out , lest you come to the same end of confusion and misery : for as concerning that assembly of men that last sat on the throne , something was done by them , in their day and time , and in both their assemblings in some things they served my Lord , and they were a rod in his hand to smite his enemies , yet they were not faithful to the end , till all his enemies were destroyed ; but rather joined themselves to fight against the Lord and his persons , and were hastening on towards the way of oppression , and persecution ; and it was time for the Lord to remove them , and to lay them aside , as an empty vessel , sometimes useful ; and to break them as a rod , sometime of service to be a scourge upon his enemies ; and when the day of their trial was over , which God gave unto them , being any longer ( For present ) unfit instruments for his hand , than he cast him into the fire ; and this his purpose came to pass upon them , so that they and the whole nation May be contented and yield themselves subject , to what he hath done concerning them ; for they being entering into the very same spirit of wickedness , of oppression , and persecution , which the Lord had once reproved through them , and cast out by them ; then was a rod raised up against them ; even as they had been against others , and they were dealt withal as they had done to others ; and this was in the justice of my Lord's hand , and what hath mortal man to question his proceedings ? and though some of you ( Present rulers ) be looked upon as great traitors and tyrants in your dealing towards them ; and doubtless the men of that part will seek vengeance against you , even by preaching and praying , and they will curse you in the name of their God , and seek continually your destruction , as such as have taken away part of their strength , and cast down their idol : but alas ! all this is nothing , for the Lord doth not account as men : for these things must needs thus come to pass for the furtherance of the kingdom and government of Jesus Christ , that it May arise through all ; and if you were but faithful to what the Lord requires of you in your present proceedings ; what you have done unto them should not be reckoned on account against you , neither by God nor good men : but , and if , you of the army , be always treacherous and disobedient towards him , and abuse your power , and disregard your price that God hath given you , and trifle away your hour about places of honour , and such self-seeking matters , and the cause of God be neglected by you , and his persons continue oppressed sufferers under you , as they have long been , even than shall you be cast aside with shameful disgrace , and the heavy hand of the Lord shall be upon you in judgement , and you shall be smitten more than any before you ; your estates shall not be spared from the spoiler , nor your souls from the pit , nor your persons from the violence of men , no nor , your necks from the axe ; for if you be unfaithful , and continually treacherous to the cause of God , then shall you be left to the will of your enemies , and they shall charge treachery and treason upon you , and your persons and estates shall be given for a prey to your enemies , and you shall not deliver yourselves , neither will the Lord deliver you from the execution of merciless men ; for my Lord shall leave the cruel-hearted to plead with you . 

Wherefore that you May be warned , i advise you be faithful , let not the cause of God fall , nor the cause of his enemies prosper before you , for there is no other way , whereby you can be preserved , nor no other defence shall you ever find from the wrath of the Lord , and from the fury of your devouring enemies , than your faithfulness in God's cause , and therefore relieve the oppressed , and take off all oppression , break down all unjust laws , and set all persons free , from unjust burdens , and let all oppression cease , both in church and civil state , and even all oppressive laws , and unjust judges , and evil men in power , let all this be removed , and the nation clean quitted and discharged even from all men , and laws whatsoever , that have held under oppression the persons , estates , and consciences of the good persons of this land , and let the nation be corrected , and all orders and places of men , and laws and decrees purified , for this my Lord , the great King requireth ; and he will suddenly have it brought to pass in the nation , if not by you , then contrary to you , and to your utter destruction , and this is the very substance of my message to you , that my Master hath given me to say unto you , and on his behalf i am come to claim of you my Masters long lost right , let him have his right , from which he hath long been banished , i demand it of you , all ye , whatsoever , that seems to bear rule in this nation , i charge you in his name , let him have his title and prerogative , let him be Lord and King wholly in his own kingdom , let him have the excercise of his people's consciences by his own spirit , in all things , related to his worship and service , and let him have the full authority by his spirit , in all things pertaining to church , and ministry , and faith , and religion , and let his spirit have the alone authority , to persuade and dissuade persons from , or to such or such ministry , worship , and practices of religion , and let all forced maintenance to ministers , and tithes be speedily taken away , and let all laws , and decrees whatsoever , made , and practised in the days of Antichrist upon the bodies , estates , and consciences of the persons , in oppression and unjustness about church , and worship , and religion , be utterly repealed , and made void , and never more be in force in this nation ; but let my Lord be sole ruler and governor , and have the full authority in his own kingdom , in all things whatsoever pertaining thereunto , and let no man henceforth hereafter , ever be entrusted with the liberties of the members of Christ's kingdom , as they are such , nor to judge over them , in any matters of faith , and worship , but give that right and privilege wholly unto the spirit of Jesus Christ , for unto him only it pertaineth , to be whole judge , and to have full power in his own kingdom , and until you give him this right , and deliver up unto him his own kingdom , and the excercise of people's consciences in all things about religion , you shall never prosper , nor none that comes after you , that shall in any measure abridge my Master of his proper right , from which he hath long been banished as i have said , and till his right be given him , in the case aforesaid , he will dash one man against another , and none shall never be established , but horn after horn shall be broken , and one power after another brought into confusion 

And therefore ye men , do not strive with him in this matter , but yield unto him , the excercise of your own consciences by his spirit in you , and let him do so unto all others , even as ye hope to prosper , and upon the penalty of his sore displeasure upon you in this world , and in the world to come ; and let just men and righteous men , and meek men , and men that have the fear and wisdom of God in them , without exceptation of birth or otherwise , let such men have the power and judgement committed to them , to determine in things between man and man ; down with all the false hearted flatterers that have ruled for man , and not for God , and for themselves , and not for the good of the persons , cast all such out from among you , for the good among you is choked by them , down with all that judge for rewards , & away with all hireling rulers , that executes the law for money , and will not plead the cause of the poor without great fees ; and down with all that will not serve places of trust without so large stipends , away with all these things out of the land , for they are heinous oppressions unto men , and great abominations in the sight of God , and the land has long groaned under the weight of these things , and the earth is weary of them , and my Lord requires their utter dissolution , as being iniquities fully ripe , and having the guilt of so much cruelty , injustice and oppression , lying upon the nation because hereof , therefore is the Lord's season to destroy them , and remove them out of the land , which if you be the instruments in such a work , it will be your greatest crown , and your perpetual honour , for the Lord's purpose is one way or other to cleanse the land of all these and other oppressions whatsoever , that the persons of this land May be a free persons from all the heavy yokes of Antichrist , which hath long sorely pressed them down , and the purpose of the Lord is to break the yokes of oppression and tyranny , from off the necks of this persons , and therefore is it that he overturneth , yea , and will overturn all men and authorities that shall oppose his work , and none shall be able to stand before him , for the presence of my Lord is more dreadful to a nation when he shows himself in his wrath , than any multitude of armed men , and woe is unto you if you be found opposeing of him , and if you seek to stop his work , you shall not cumber the earth very long , nor oppress the nation many days , wherefore consider , cursed will you be if you be unfaithful in what you have to do on the Lord's behalf , for your hour passeth over that is allotted you , and will be suddenly expired , never to be recalled , and then you cannot work . 

And whereas there is a great cry about ministry , for sending forth , and maintaining , and encouraging a godly ministry , as you say ; now to this , i do answer on my Lord's behalf ▪ and i must tell you plainly , as for a true godly ministry truly called and sent of God , such a ministry and such ministers you can never be able to hinder , but the Lord will send them out , maintaining them , and preserve them , whether you will or no , and while you are troubling yourselves about such a matter , you are but meddling with things above your line , and out of your jurisdiction , while you act in such a case , for it belongs to his government to send out ministers whom and as he will , and to maintain them and defend them according to his own pleasure , and all this without you , for such ministers truly called thereunto , and sent of the Lord , will not seek to you to be sent forth or maintained by you , they will not be beholding to you in such a case , but even without you and contrary to you , must they be sent out and maintained , so that the Lord will have a ministry in this nation purely of his own , and not of man , nor by man , and such a ministry you shall not be able to hinder . 

And i must tell you plainly , as for these men called ministers in this nation , the way of their setting up , and sending forth , and the way of their maintenance , and the way of their standing and defence , and in every particular of their being such ; they are the greatest and most woeful oppression in the nation , even the most abominable and unjust cruelties and tyrannies is acted through them , as any other thing in the nation , and they are ( As such aforesaid ) the woeful cause of the nations groaning under merciless dealing ; and there is upon their account the guilt of blood , injustice , and oppression lying upon this nation ; their iniquities , their iniquities cries for vengeance upon their own heads , for they are full , they are full , and the measure thereof is near finished , and God's eternal vengeance is their next reward , from the eternal God ; what shall i say of them but this , the earth is oppressed by them , the inhabitants groans under them , and the righteous God is vexed through them , and they are the very men of high indignation and fierce wrath , and all their practices ( As such ) are the fuel of his anger , to be consumed by the fire of his jealousy ; the nation is weary and its inhabitants ; and the Lord is weary because of these men , and is this the ministry cried up by you as godly and pious , & c ? are these the men that the nation must be forced to maintain in their pride and idolatry ? is this the ministry that must be encouraged ? Well , if these be the men , and this the ministry which must be established and encouraged by you , in so doing you shall never prosper , but thereby gain the displeasure of the almighty unto you , to bring a curse upon all your doings even because hereof ; for i must tell you , the hand of my Lord is against them , and whosoever shall seek to defend them , shall not prosper in their doings , because their oppressions , cruelties , deceits , and abominations are nigh finished and fulfilled ; wherefore take heed unto yourselves , for this is my Master's advice unto you ; let this ministry alone , and join not yourselves to Baal , lest you perish ; neither take part with Antichrist any longer , neither be ye fighters against the lamb and his kingdom , but free the nation , and let all its inhabitants be freed from the cruel tasks and yokes of such men and such a ministry as aforasaid ; uphold it not against the Lord , for if you do , you shall never be established : and this is from the mouth of my Lord unto you . 

And last of all , my Master hath a persons in this nation , even a suffering persons , that have born the burden of the cruelty and injustice and wickedness both of rulers and teachers , who hath as it were trodden them down , and made them a very prey to their devouring mouths ; the very cry of their sufferings hath reached unto heaven , and the very sound thereof your ears have heard ; and this persons are greatly beloved , and my Lord will assuredly honour them , and his hand shall be continue to preserve them , and defend them against all their enemies whatsoever ; and he doth reserve them to himself , and for a glorious work that he hath to do by them , and he hath form them for himself , and they cannot join with any of the horns of the great beast , neither can a place of honour pervert them from their perfect way , but my Lord he compasseth them about on every side , and hath kept them in the midst of trials , reproaches , and sufferings ▪ and covered them in the heath , and in the storm , and his pleasure is to make further use of them , they are his , and not their own , and they must fulfil his will , and none besides , and they lie at rest in him , while mountains are overturned , and while one potsherd of the earth breaks another , and this must be even till the appointed time , and to say no more of them though much Might be said , they are had in remembrance before the Lord , to do with them even for his own glory , and for this nations perpetual good , and to the authority of the most high through them , shall Kings of the earth , and nations of the world bow and tremble , wherefore ye men touch them not , neither do ye afflict them even as you hope to prosper , remember their cause , and suffer it not always to be rejected as it hath long been , but keep yourselves free from the injustice and cruelty of them that have gone before you , who have been merciless and oppressors of that persons , even till my Lord hath confounded them , and brought them into confusion , for there is the weight of blood , of tyranny and oppression lying upon the nation in that people's cause , and my Lord will revenge them in his season , and though they are not weary of their sufferings , but are in the patience , which beareth all things , yet the nation can never be happy , nor its gournment ever blessed while this persons are held in bondage , and their sufferings are deeply considered of the Lord , and the season thereof is expiring towards an end , and when this cometh to pass , than woe unto the kingdom of Antichrist , and to the whore , and false prophet , even when their strength is dried up , by which they have made war against the lamb , and his followers , yea , woe unto them , great fearfulness shall be upon all the world , when the King of that persons reigns upon the earth , and the time is at hand , blessed is the man that waiteth for it , and blessed is he that is not offended in his coming , but is prepared to receive him in his appearing , which suddenly cometh upon all the world . 

And thus i have told you the Lord's present message unto you , which i received from him , and thus far i am clear , and whether you accept it or reject it , my peace and reward is for ever with him , who am a subject of his kingdom , and a friend to this nation , however otherwise judged by ignorant men .
