Or , a short and exact historical description of every King , with the right they have had to the crown , and the manner of their wearing of it ; especially from William the conqueror . 

Wherein is demonstated , that there hath been no direct succession in the line to create an hereditary right , for six or seven hundred years ; faithfully collected out of our best histories , and humbly presented to the parliament of England .

To the reader . 

Reader , 

In the study of politics , the more confident we are , commonly the less proficient we are . For there is no other study wherein the passions of men do more impetuously contravene , and overturn right reason . Men born in popular states , think themselves bound to abhor all Kings , as being de genere bestiarum rapacium : so Rome itself pronounced from the mouth of Cato the censor . Others on the contrary born under monarchs , speak as odiously of democracies , and make this reply to Cato , that even Rome herself , when she plundered a third part of the world , and graced her own captains , with the pompous titles of Africanus , Asiaticus , Achaicus , &c. was as ravenous a beast as any other . See what strong Byasses wisemen have , and obey . The question is not , whether this , or that form be free from oppression and injustice , or not ; we know well , all forms have their peculiar advantages , and disadvantages : and that at some times they all transgress their own rules and interests , as it were by accident , and not out of misconstitution : the question is , whether the one constitution or the other be more free , {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} {non-roman} , from oppression , and injustice ? Now for solution of this , greater light shines , and breaks in upon us from demonstration , and sensual proof , then from syllogisms , and logical inductions . Reading assures us , that Rome was not so just to other nations , nor so constant to the interest of her own citizens , when she was under Kings and Emperors , as she was , when she chose her own consuls , and limited magistrates . 't is as apparent also at this day , that the persons of Venice , the German hanse-towns , Switzerland , the united provinces , &c. do more flourish , and truly enjoy the due benefits of liberty , there the French , Turkish , or any royalists whatsoever . 't is further as visible by the public banks of treasure kept in democracies , and the strange splendour which traffic brings to them beyond monarchies , that faith is not kept so sacred and inviolable where one reigns , as where majesty and supreme power remains vested in the persons ; and most sure it is , the sanctity and untemerated chastity of public faith is the best and firmest basis of all government . To dispute these things , is to undervalue the report of our own senses ; and to deny our own senses , is to deny ourselves to be men . The enemies of our present government ubraide this our popular model , the rather , because it exasperates all our neighbours against us ; whereas this is a great argument for us , that our neighbours are troubled at the ejection of monarchy . For neighbours are more apt to envy then pity : and the condition of him that is envied , is far better than his that is pitied . The main advantage that commends hereditary monarchy , is the unity of it , for that it is not so liable to civil broils and commotions , as other temperaments where the magistrate is elective : yet reader , if thou wilt strip thyself of thy passions and prejudices , and peruse this treatise , thou shalt see that even hereditary monarchy itself is far from being a sovereign , a remedy against civil breaches and divisions . The author of this book is unknown to me , and the book itself came casually to my hands , but i have been induced to publish it , because it invites thee not to precepts , but precedents , not to disputable but to visible politics . I need say no more ; by the work rather than report judge of the author , and by experiment rather than logic judge of the work .

The true portraiture of the Kings of England , drawn from their titles , successions , reigns , and ends , &c.  

To treat of the nature and difference of governments , the distinction and pre-eminence of monarchy , or aristocracy , with the other kinds , and forms , which have , according to the temper of the persons , and the necessity of providence , had their course in the world , will be useless in this discourse , which is calculated only for this nation , and to describe not so much the government , as the persons who have ruled among us , and is only suited to monarchy as it hath had the sway of the English throne ; a discourse not so pleasing as profitable ; we are loathe to have our old sores lanced , or to think of change , though it be of misery , the temper of this nation being apt to be pleased with any thing that is stately , and costly , though never so dangerous and miserable ; yet something must be said in general , to prepare the way for the particulars of this treatise , which is not intended as controversial , or definitive of the nature of things , but merely practical and demonstrative , fit for every eye that means not to shut himself up in blindness , and darkness . 

As the foundation and original of government is confessed to be of equal antiquity with the generation and multiplication of mankind : so doubless the just and methodical use , and due management of it , is as necessary to the well-being of men , as the exact proportions , and orderly motions of the heavens are to the preservation of the globes ; and certainly without it the rational world would be more miserable than the material without sun , moon and stars , with all celestial influences , which as they do beautify and bespangle the world , so they do preserve it from returning to its first chaos , and rude mass of matter ; nothing being more contrary to that unity , and harmony , which the god of nature hath moulded , and disposed all things at first in , than disorder , and confusion , in which , as there is nothing of a deity to be discerned , so nothing of peace or happiness can possibly be found . 

And notwithstanding all this , the world hath scarce known what the natural sweetness and true benefits of government are , but only as comparative and rather as opposite to anarchy , then as advancing really and effectually the just liberties and freedoms of societies , or propagating the commonwealth of mankind ; for what through the ignorance and sloth of the persons , and the pride and ambition of governors , the whole order and end of government hath been inverted , and subverted , upon all occasions ; and that which was made for the good of the whole , hath been so contracted , and circumscribed in one person , that the great and sovereign use , and end of it , by practice and custom , hath been rather to set up the pomp , and state of one man , and his family , then to promote or propagate the profit and happiness of the universe ; and whereas of right to its constitution , it should have a free election as its original , and common good for its end , and just and equal laws for its rule ; it hath had usurpation for its principle , and tyranny , and bondage for its medium , and end . As to this day we May see in the greatest part of the world , where all the liberties of million of men of all sorts of conditions , and ranks , are buried in the glory and splendour of one family ; through which narrow channels , all honour and justice , all law and reason are to run up and down the world . 

And whereas the goodness , and beauty of government consists in the harmonious temperature of power , and obedience , of authority , and liberty , it hath been quite otherwise inverted by practice , and made apparent to lie in the majesty , and greatness of the monarch , and the absolute subjection , and servitude of the persons ; and the excellency , and sweetness of it rather to be seen in the presence-chamber , and the magnificence , and grandeur of the court , then in the courts of justice , and the rich and flourishing estate of the kingdom , nothing being accounted more political , and glorious , then to have the Prince high , and the subjects beggars ; and yet this ceremonial way of government , hath took most place in the world , and got almost divine adoration , and hath thrust out all other forms of government , ( Equally sacred with itself , and most proportionable to the nature and benefits of societies , and the fee-simple of all the liberties of the persons ( Which are as their blood and spirits in their veins ) sold to maintain its state . 

Besides many causes , and grounds of this degeneration ( Whereby so much misery hath overflowed the nations of the world ) i find two , which at present are principally to be mentioned ; the first is the neglect of a right sense , and the often inculcating the original , and end of government ; and the next a lineal succession , or continuation of government , by a natural and supposed heirship ; for want of the first , neither the persons know their own rights , or how to maintain them ; or the governor his use and end , nor how to keep himself within the just bounds , and limits of his creation ; for what between the stupidity , and ignorance of the persons in not knowing their primitive privileges , that they are the original , and end of vernment ; and the pride , and ambition of men , when once they have got power , forget both how they came by it , and to what end they are distinguished from other men , government comes both to be usurped , and tyrannical . Did the persons but know that their choice and election is the foundation of just authority , & that none can rule over them but whom they appoint , they would not then be drawn into controversies and debates , whether it be treason in them to cast off a bad governor , who have the only power of choosing a good one ; and on the other side , if Kings , and Princes ( For to reduce all to them who have been most guilty of the abuse of government ) had but the continual sense of the root from whence they sprung , and the duties annexed to their offices , they could not look on themselves as rulers , but tyrants when they acted for their own private prerogative ▪ in distinction from , and contrary to the liberties and freedoms of the persons ; but these considerations have been by time and prescription worn out of the mind and memories of both , partly through continual insinuations of court maxims , and the spirit of bondage in the persons , and by force and usurpation in the magistrate , whereby it hath gone a long while for currant , that the persons have no power , nor the Prince no account to give but to God , from whom they challenge an immediate title , as if Kings and Princes , all their names , and successions were let down from heaven , in the same sheet that the beasts were in Peter's vision , and had not their root in the earth as all other magistrates besides . We have had much ado of late , but to beat off from these royal notions , both by pens and swords , and yet still they have too strong a hold in most men's hearts , though to their own undoing . 

Whereas all men are equally born free , and naturalised into all the privileges of freedom and just liberty , no man can obtain a special power over any , but either ex pacto aut scelere , either by willing agreement , and consent , which is the right and just way of title , and most natural , or by conquest , and usurpation , which is most exotic , and unjust ; for the original of kingly power , in the scripture , we all know it came in as an effect of the wantonness , and discontents of the Israelites , against that special way of government God himself had set over them ; and view the character God gives to them of that government , and not a blessing he gives them with it ; for its rise among the heathens , and nations ( Which knew not God ( Among whom that government most prevailed ; ) it was certainly first good , and grounded on the exorbitancies , and excess of other magistrates , and a high opinion of the justice , and virtue of some particluar persons , as Cicero lib. offic. 2. excellently expresseth it ; mihi quidem non apud medos solum ( ut ait Herodotus ) sed etiam apud majores nostros , servandae justiciae causa videntur olim bene morati reges constituti : nam cum premeretur initio multitudo ab iis qui majores opes habebant , ad unum aliquem confugiebant virtute praestantem . as if taking it for granted that among all nations that preservation , and execution of justice , with enjoining of virtue , was the first ground of the constitution of Kings ; but they having got by their own goodness chief power and authority , use that favour they had gained from their own deserts , to advance their own family ; and having got in the affections of the persons , through the sense of their own present worth , what by power and force , and what by policy and craft , got the same power entailed on their heirs , and so by custom have made succession the only right , or at least the most just to crowns , and sceptres . 

A principle which hath more hindered the advance of government , and run it on more hazards and mischiefs than any other , where by a fatal custom , persons must be irreparably content with what they can find , and reducing all to a blind fate , & fortune , be he good , or prove bad , talis , qualis , give up both their own wills and liberties to such a succession , not only by a natural necessity , but a divine institution : how the world came to be so blinded , as thus to give away their rights and liberties , and mortgage their understandings , and freedom , as bankrupts do their lands , is not to be determined , but by supposal of a judgement of God , and an overreach of power and force , or by an ignis fatuus of policy and subtlety . 

For this natural and hereditary succession ( Which is now adored as the grand title ) if truly considered , is nothing else but a continuation of conquest , or a surprisal by the good nature of the persons , when they have been either low , and in fear , and taking advantage of their high esteem of some eminent person , who hath been more than ordinary instrumental to them , have got the persons to convey the same honour to their posterity after them ; the people's consent being thus ravished from them , it 's made a law , both civil and divine to after generations ; but the world is now , or should be grown wise : let us consider the nature and use of this succession , both in general , and particular , especially as it hath been acted in England . 

Among all the catalogue of vanities which Solomon reckons up in his sacred retractations , there is none he puts such a character on , as for a man to spend his time and strength in getting of riches , and knows not who shall succeed him in the enjoyment of the profit and good of his labour , or whether he May be a wise man or a fool ; but what a misery , and worse than vanity is this , that the supreme power of government ( In the right execution of which all the concernments of million of men are interested ) should be entailed on one man , ( Though never so deserving in his own person , ) and the heirs of his body , be he good or bad , a wise man , or very nigh a fool , and so all their happiness depend on hap and hazard from generation to generation ? 

It cannot be rationally or spiritually supposed , that any man should be born a magistrate or governor , especially not successively , when the best men , and most choice spirits , who have had the highest eminencies of virtue , and best improvement of education , and natural genius , are hardly fit for so great a work . If Kings have such a vis formativa in their loins , as to beget Kings in the likeness of their office , as children in the image of their natures , it must be necessarily supposed , that they must generate all these royal qualifications together with them , and by the same natural necessity transfer all their princely endowments to them also . 

Whereas i had almost affirmed it , ( And i hope no man can account it either heresy or treason ) that God himself cannot entail on any particular line of mankind , the power and authority of government out of his wisdom , and love to their happiness ( Without he meant to do it in judgement , and to plague the world ) and not give them suitable and successive qualifications also , fit for that employment ; it being God's use ( According to his wisdom , and righteousness ) neither ordinarily nor extraordinarily to call out persons to any place , but he anoints them with proportionable gifts to it . 

And yet the poor persons ( Whom God hath naturally made free , and to make use of their own understandings and affections for their own good ) are by this succession , bound up from the improvement either of soul or body , fain to be content with what they can get for present , and to shift it out from age to age ( With the loss of all opportunities of choice ) only with what corrupt nature brings them forth , which oftentimes travels sorely in pain with the curse of the fathers who begat these governors . Hence also it comes to pass , that oftentimes children are made Kings , and though they are uncapable at present for the actual exercise of that office , yet are proclaimed , as having the right , and title , and all things acted in their name , and the whole commonwealth , it May be of many nations , must wait for his capacity with fear and hope , which capacity is also at best to be judged by his years , rather than fitness or qualification for so high a trust ; and in the mean while the kingdom must be governed by some favourites of the last King , or some next kinsman to this ; and while the King is thus in pupillage , we May well ask , who governs the kingdom ? And yet oftentimes it hath fallen out , that their government hath been better ordered in their nonage by others , then in their own by themselves , as appears especially in the reign of Henry the third , and Henry the sixth , Kings of England ; the first being but nine years old when his father died , the latter but nine months ; who while they were young , and under the protection of certain wise and sober men , the laws were administered uprightly , and with much justice ; but when they themselves came to the years of kingship , and prerogative ▪ so royalled , that both laws & liberties were soon altered and abolished , as anon the reader shall have a more exact account ; and how sad is it , that when government May be advanced as well , if not better by others in their minority , without their presence or influence , the world must be at such vast charges for a title , and to maintain it ere they can use it , and which is worst , that when they come to exercise it themselves , should make their title the ground of their tyranny . But if it so happen ( For its a mere chance ) ▪ that the next heir prove somewhat more than ordinary capable , yet what the next May prove , who knows ? If he be an infant , ( As it many times falls out ) then there must be patient and hopeful waitings , to see what he will be when grown up ; until that , there can be no further progress made in the alteration or reformation of affairs , though of never so great , and present concernment ; and when he comes to these years which custom pronounceth him capable , how unreasonable is it , that nothing can hinder , or exclude him from his authority , but that he is incapable of being begged for a fool ? It being enough , if he can know his own name , and be able to write himself rex , though he knows little what belongs to the office , or relation of a King . 

If he be one of riper years , and stature , on which this su•••ssion falls , then must all the observation of his nature , and the ominous , and more than astrological aspects of his constitution , and education be forgotten ; and although silenced in his pretended title , and a full compliance looked after , though oppressed with never so many fears , and secret wishes of a more hopeful governor ; yea , and though he hath been never so active against the liberties of the persons , when but a Prince , and given demonstrations what a governor they May expect , yet his succession must be his qualification , and indemnity , and his title his virtue . 

On this ground also it comes to pass , that oftentimes women come to hold the reins of government ; and to steer at the helm , as well as men ; for if there be any defect of the male line , the female succeeds ; and that feeble and weaker sex , whom God & nature have ordained to be only particular helps , and good subjects , ( Only to keep up the name of a family ) must be invested with the highest authority , over the choicest , and most select spirits of many nations , and all further thoughts of bettering the state of things utterly extinguished by a female pretence . 

And which is most desperate by this succession , ( And its plea of the only and absolute right ) the fundamental liberties of the persons are not only insensibly undermined , but absolutely rooted up , and that birthright privilege of the persons , their election and choice , than which , they have nothing more natural , and which is far more hereditary to them and theirs , then by all the laws of God ▪ nature , and reason , crowns can be to Kings and their heirs , is quite extinguished ; for pass by the first King , ( Who it May be as with us it hath been , came in by conquest ) you must go back in some kingdoms five hundred , in others a thousand years , ere you can but recover the clear notion of a free election ( Wherein the people's power and privilege is alone and peculiarly seen ) and yet that so faintly and hardly extorted from them , as great loans of money from a cruel miser , without use or advantage ; and though election must be acknowledged at last , the first just ground of government , yet custom in successions soon wears out its right , and transfers it on the next blood ; and though in England it appears by the coronation oath , that there is even in succession a kind of election , yet it 's so limited in the line , that it 's as good as nothing , and so weak and implicitly manifested , that it 's but a mere customary ceremony , which always is pursued by the natural title , and only used to deceive the persons , and as a step to the further confirmation of a more fundamental , and sure right ; and its easy to demonstrate it ; for our Kings soon forget it , ere they come from Westminster to Whitehall , or from the chair of inauguration to the presence chamber . In a word , what gives all this ground of such an inevitable and successively insensible encroachment on the laws and liberties of nations , but this lineal title , whereby the son without remedy goes on where the father left off , and by a divine pretence seizeth on what by nature is due to the meanest subject , as to himself ? And what makes the present Kings so daring , and venturous to raise their own prerogative , but this , that that they know there can be no alienation of the crown from his heirs , and that they May make it better ( That is more tyrannical ? ) but surer they cannot : and thus there is a constant hope , and possibility , by continuation and propagation of principles , and designs , backed with title , and authority , that what cannot be done in one Kings reign , May be done in the next , and so on ; for the minds of Princes are not usually contracted , or contented with present enjoyments ; especially if there be any restraint on their wills , or more of height , or advancement to be attained unto . 

Yea , this is one of the main reasons ( That in our times can be rendered ) why we have had such uneven actings , and such strange alterations in several Kings reigns ; the principles , and laws , the persons have been always the same , who are capable of small or no variation or change , but as higher , and supreme influences move them , of which none hath been so powerful as Princes , who as they are stars of the first magnitude , so of the strongest operations ; and though the persons be compared to the sea , yet as the sea , they have no turbulent motion of their own , but what is occasioned by violent and uncertain winds ; but the great change hath been by the temper , and actings of Princes , and commonly the next successor hath been the omen and fate of the times ; if any way good , than the nation smiled , and his reign began the spring ; if probable , there was hopes ; and yet both these at first promised , but at length frustrated ; and however the beginnings were , yet the succession of acts demonstrated how the title was create ; for until they have made their succession sure , none have been more fair , and promising , but afterwards both laws and liberties , like favourites , have been advanced ad placitum ; and what they have got an interest in by nature , that by prerogative they have centred in their own proper persons , even the most fundamental privileges of the persons , and have only granted leases unto the persons of their own inheritances , and dated them not for life ( Which would have been too great a mercy ) but as long as the royal pleasure lasts , which changes always with advantages . Yea , by this succession tyranny is so entailed , and all things so necessarily acted , as if the Prince were not only the civil , but natural parent of the persons , and that Kings had begot the persons as so many bastards to obey , as they do beget one lawfully to reign over them . 

it 's too well known , that good and wise men are the fewest of the sons of men , and are commonly picked out here , and there , as rich pearls on the shore of violent torrents ; but to expect in one line , and family , a succession of good , wise , and governing men , is almost as probable to Christians , as to expect Mahomet's second coming among the Turks , after so many hundred years' delusion ; and although it must be acknowledged , that there have been some good Kings , yet they have been so few , that as their names from the beginning of the world can hardly make up the dominical letters in the almanac , or possibly supply the holidays in the year , so a little goodness hath gone far , and at the best we shall find it but comparative ; good Kings instead of better governors , as some of the Roman Caesar's , chose those to succeed them who were worse than themselves , that they Might commend , and set off their own reign , though tyrannical enough in itself ; and we May without any passion demonstrate , that the design by succession hath been rather to keep up the governors , and palliate their vices , than ever to maintain or heighten the glory , and splendour , or carry on the benefit of the government itself in the execution of good and righteous laws . 

But to come nigher home , and leave generals ( Granting succession in itself to be a good title ) let us view without partiality , the succession of the Kings of England , whereby they plead their title to the crown , and we shall find in our histories , that nothing hath been more commonly interrupted , than a succession of the next heir ; and for this seven or eight hundred years ( If not more ) we have not had succession continue in any even line or just right , and no title was ever more broken , and unjust , then of our Kings , if they make a lineal , and hereditary succession the foundation of their right ; let us look but a little back to those which preceded the Norman race , especially among the Saxons and Danes , the ancient competitors for the government of this nation , and it will appear , that the right heir hath been commonly past by ; and strangers or usurpers preferred ; to go no further back then to Alfred King of the West Saxon , and the twenty fourth monarch of the Englishmen ; as soon as he died , Athelstan his bastard was preferred before his legitimate son Edmond , & after him got his own brother Edmond to succeed him ; and though this Edmond left two sons , Edwin , and Edgar , yet as he & his former brother had usurped the government , so Edred his brother stepped into the throne , and put them by until he had finished his reign , & then they took their turns ; Edwin first , and Edgar after him ; this Edgar had two wives , Ethelfled his first , and Elfrida the second : by the first he had issue , Edward , surnamed the martyr , who succeeded his father in title ; but having hardly felt the crown warm , and fast on his head , was cruelly murdered , to make way for the second wife's son Ethelred who succeeded him , as Daniel well expresseth it , whose entrance into his reign was blood , the middle misery , and the end confusion ; and though he left his son Edmond , surnamed Ironside , to succeed him , yet Canutus the Dane by compact got half of the kingdom from him , and soon after the whole , setting up his Danish title , and murdering the two sons Edmund had left , with his brother Edwin , that no further pretence Might be made by them of their title ; and now come the Danes to convey their title by ▪ Canutus ; and yet Harrolld his bastard gets the crown before Hardicanute , who was his legitimate son ; and among these three Kings ( For the government under the Danes continue but twenty six years , and only under these three was aone usurper , & immediately interrupted the right of succession . And the Danes government being ended , which was but an interval of conquest ) the Saxons regain their title ; and Edward , called the confessor , the seventh son of Elthelred ( Who came in with the murder of the right heir ) being kept as a reserve in Normandy ) is elected King , and the Saxons title now begins to revive , but soon it 's extinguished , not only by the Norman pretence ▪ but by the next successor , Harrolld the second , son to Goodwin , Earl of Kent , who came in with the expulsion of Edgar athlings the proper successor . 

And with Harrolld ended the Saxon race , which had lasted about five hundred years , after the coming in of Hengist , and their plantation in this kingdom ; and yet you see what have been the titles successively of these former Kings , wherein the line hath not only been now and then through force and violence cut off and discontinued , but usurpation solemnised with as much ceremony as any natural pretence : but these instances are but as representations of objects afar off , which May seem otherwise then they are ; we will go on and review the title of our Kings from William the Norman , surnamed the conqueror , and by whom , not only the line , but all the whole frame of laws and liberties were not only curtailed but changed ; for though in the reigns of the former Kings , every conqueror made his impression , and drew his picture in England , yet never was the whole scene of state changed until now , and a new model so peremptorily ( And without repeal ) introduced , as by him : the first jus , or right of his title ( The only foundation of all the rest of our latter Kings ( We all know was by mere conquest , which as it is a disseisin in law , so an unjust title in reason , and common to one as unto another : yet he though a bastard , ( And so had less title to his dukedom then to England which he won by the sword ) made himself the principal of that divine succession we now stand upon , and all our Kings have no other pretence then by the succession of his sword ; and certainly , if the fountain , and head-spring be corrupt , the stream cannot be crystal and pure ; and yet ( As Baron Thorpe declares in his charge given at the assizes holden at York the twentieth of March , 1648. and now in print ) of all these twenty four Kings , which have Kinged it amongst us since that William , there are but seven of them that could pretend legalty to succeed their former predecessors , either by lineal , or collateral title , ( And he Might have contracted that number , and have been modest enough . ) But that the reader May not be prejudiced , or wrap up his understanding in any expression , let him but follow the descents of the Kings of England in the line , ( And pardon the first strange and exotic way of right ) and he will discover , that as the first title was create by force , so the succession hath been continue by usurpation . Speed ( Too royal a writer ) gives us a hint to go on upon in the life of Henry the fourth , page 746. ( Asketh by way of interrogation ) what right had will , the conqueror , the father of all our glorious tyrants ? What right ( We speak , saith he , of a right of equity ) had his son William Rufus , and Henry the first , while their elder brother lived ? and so he goes on . But to give a more particular account to the reader , how ▪ every King came to his crown , let us begin with the first of the first . 

After that the first William , who laid the foundation of his right in the blood of the English , had left this world , as well as his kingdom , great strivings there were who should succeed ; and though he left three sons , Robert , William , and Henry , yet could leave but one heir , which was Robert ; yet William surnamed Rufus , gets the crown set on his head , notwithstanding the elder brother's title , and though Robert fights for his right , yet being too weak in the field , is forced to a composition , on these terms that he should enjoy it after his decease , if he happened to survive ; and yet notwithstanding , Henry the youngest brother ( Called Henry the first ) steps in , and makes use of his brother's absence to set up himself in his place ; and Robert yet surviving , he wears it in his stead , and however he strove to regain his right , he at last was fain to yield up , not only his title , but his person to Henry , who not only unjustly excluded him from the succession to the kingdom , but cruelly put out his eyes that he Might only feel his misery , and never see his remedy . The line male of the conqueror is now extinct , as well as it was irregularly diverted ; as William got his right by his sword , so all his successors maintained it in imitation of him , rather than by any legal pretence they could derive from him . But Henry the first ( Though ▪ he had come in over the back of his elder brother ) that he Might make more sure work for a succession , wanting issue male living , pitcheth on Maud his daughter , formerly married to the Emperor Henry the fourth , who left her a widow , and died without issue ; and having sworn all the nobility ( Especially Stephen ) to her , ordained her & her issue to be his successors in England's ▪ throne , and married her again to Jeoffrey Plantagenet , the son and heir apparent of Fulk , than Earl of Aniou , by whom she had three sons , Henry , Jeffrey , and William ; to Henry the crown belonged as next heir after his mother ( By the usurped title of his father , ) yet Stephen , Earl of Mortain , and Bulloign , son to Adelincia the third daughter of William the conqueror , by Maud his wife , ( Notwithstanding his oath to the last King ) gets the crown set on his own head , and excludes her , and her issue for the present ; yet after he died , Henry , called the second , surnamed shortmantle , though his mother was alive , enjoys it . This Henry had six sons , William , Henry Richard , Jeoffrey , Philip , John ; the two first dying , Richard the third son , the first of that name , surnamed ceur de lion succeeded his father ; this Richard dying without issue , his youngest brother John usurps the crown , notwithstanding Jeoffrey his elder brother had left a young son , named Arthur plantaganet King of Britain , who was heir apparent to the crown ; and after he died , Henry his son the third of that name succeeds him , though Arthurs sister was then alive , ( Though in prison ) who was next to the title ( Such as it was ) ; after him Edward surnamed Longshanks , called Edward the first , lays hold on the crown and wore it with much majesty , and after him Edward the second his son goes on , but still on the old account , and on the ruin of the most proper heirs ; this Edward was deposed by the parliament for his ill government as anon shall be more fully related ; and his son Edward the third of that name set up in his room ; after him followed Richard the second , son to the black Prince , who was also deposed , after whose dethroning , Henry called the fourth , son to John of Gant Duke of Lancaster , and uncle to the former King , snatcheth up the crown , though of right it , was to descend to Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March , the son and heir of Lionel Duke of Clarence , the third son of Edward the third , and an elder brother of John Duke of Lancaster ; and thus we have nothing hitherto , but interruption , and usurpation ; and those which in their own reigns can pretend a divine title by succession , which must not be altered , can for their advantage put by the succession of the issue of others . But to go on , here now began the bloody wars , and contests between the house of Lancaster , and York which made the world to ring of the misery of the civil wars of England , and all about a title , and neither of them ( If seriously weighed ) had a right title by succession , if the first title of their ancestors were to be the original ; but that custom Might be the best right , he got in his son Henry , who was the fifth of that name , to succeed ; and his son Henry the sixt ( Though an infant ) takes his place , until Edward Duke of York overthrew his army in the battle at Towton field , and got him deposed , and was proclaimed King by the name of Edward the fourth , though the title had been carried on in the house of Lancaster thorough three descents ; thus favour , and fortune , not lineal succession always gave the best title ; this Edward left two sons behind him , ( To maintain the succession of the house of York ) Edward and Richard Duke of York and five daughters . His elder son Edward who was the fifth of that name , succeeded him in claim , & title , but rather lived then reigned ( Being an infant ) had never any actual exercise of his government ; for ric.  Duke of Gloucester , and uncle to this infant , and made his protector , that he Might set up himself , causeth both the young titular King , & his brother , ( These two royal infants ) to be barbarously murdered in their beds , and so wears the crown himself , by the name of Richard the third , until Henry Earl of Richmond ( A twig of a bastard of John of Gaunt ) by his valour at Bosworth field , having overthrown his army , slew the tyrant himself , and create by his sword ( For other he had none ) a new title to himself , and was crowned King , by the name of Henry the seventh , who , what by his power and by a marriage of the Lady eliz. the elder daughter of ed. the fourth , confirmed his succession , & from him do all our later Princes derive their title , as Henry the eighth , Edward the sixth , Queen Mary , Queen Elizabeth , King James , and our last tyrant Charles . this Henry , the foundation of our great ones , was himself but a private man , who as Speed says , had scarce any thing of a just title , or of a warrantable intention , but to remove an usurper ; besides there were many natural heirs of the house of York which were children of Edward the fourth , and George Duke of Clarence , Richard's elder brother , who had better right : but when once a title is made , it must be maintained , and if it can but get thorough two or three successors , it 's presently proclaimed to be jure divino , and pleaded as the only just title and right . 

Thus you have a faithful , and true account of the succession of our Norman monarchs ; we can only say we have had so many persons reigning , and as Kings of England ; but for a title by lineal succession , there is none , but what every man May make aswell as any man , and what is as proper to a stranger , as to an heir ; power , and favour , murder and deceit being the most common principles of the right of most of our Kings to their government over us . If it be asked , as Speed doth , what right had William the conqueror ? then it must follow , what right had all the rest ? but supposing his right , what right had these , who so many times cut off the line , and made themselves the stock of future succession ? and what misery is it that this broken and usurped title must still be forced on us , even by an ecclesiastical , and divine institution , who have now a way of redeeming our liberties , and bettering our conditions , and following the direct line of just and true titles , the election and choice of the persons ? Is not five or six hundred year enough for England to be under the succession of a Norman bastard ( Pardon the expression , its true though plain ) and to be sold with all its liberties , from usurpation to usurpation , as well as from generation to generation ? I need not be very zealous in application , the history is enough to make all wise men consider , by whom we have all this while been governed , and upon what terms ; how tyranny and usurpation comes to be adored , if it have but a royal name added to it . Shall the parliament of England be now blamed for cutting off that race of usurpers and tyrants , and reducing affairs to their first natural and right principle ; or will the persons of England after all their experiences , centre their liberties and freedoms in a customary usurpation of succession , and lose their commonwealth for the personal glory of a young pretender ? especially , when they have fought against the father , and cut him off as a tyrant , endeavour to set up the son to follow on both the first cause , and revenge , merely because he was supposed to be proceeded of his polluted loins : this blindness will be our misery , and endear us to a more perfect and more tyrannical slavery then ever yet England felt . 

But to go on , the reader hath seen what a line we have had in England , and how pure a title our Kings have had to their crowns ; let 's now but have patience to view their actings successively , and yet shortly , and we shall better guess of their right by their reigns ; for though one would think that they should endeavour to make good a bad title by a good reign , yet it hath been far otherwise ; every man having made his right by force , maintained it by tyranny ; and when they have gotten power , never remembered how , or to what end they attained it ; if we look back again , and make a new and strict survey of their several actings in their government , and go over every King's head since Willam the conqueror , we shall not much mistake if we pass by Turkey , Russia , the Moors , and yet call England's Kings tyrants , and their subjects slaves ; and however in the theory , and system it have been limited , and bounded by good and distinguishing laws , yet in the exercise and practic part almost of every King's reign , we shall find it deserve as bad a name as others who are called most absolute ; for the laws and privileges which this poor nation hath enjoyed , as they have been but complementally granted for the most part , and with much design , so they have ever ( Upon any occasion ) proved but weak and low hedges against the springtides , and land floods of the prerogative of the Prince , which hath always gained more on the privileges of the persons , than ever the sea by all its washing and beatings of its boisterous and unmerciful waves hath gained on the land ; for if at any time the poor Commons ( Through much struggling , and a good and present necessitous mood of the Prince ) have got off any present oppressions , and forced out the promise for enacting of any good and seasonable laws : yet either the next advantage , or at least the next successor , hath been sure , either to silence , or diannul it , and encroached upon it ; and never was privilege or good law enacted , or gained to the persons , but by hard pressure of the subject , and with a predominant ingredient of the King's advantage , and still rather out of courtesy then right . We shall find also that England for three or four hundred years together ( Some lucida intervalla excepted ) hath been a stage of blood , and the astonishment of all nations in civil wars , and that merely , either for the clearing of the title to the crown ( Which yet at last was only made lawful by the prevailing power , and as soon made illegal when another side got the better ) or else by the subject and Barons , taking up arms to defend themselves , and make rampires ( If possible ) against the inundation of prerogative , and rather preserving , then obtaining any additions of liberties , and yet they were commonly defeated at last ; for if for the present by some eminent advantage , they got a little ground , they soon lost it again by royal stratagems , and were either forced , or complemented ▪ into their old miseries , with a worse remembrance of former actings . But to enter into the particulars of this sad story : 

All men know ( Or May ) the tyrannical domination of that first William , who behaved himself as a conqueror indeed , and a most perfect tyrant ( Since whom we have never had an English man , but one , who hath been naturalised by the succession of his conquest as King of England ) he presently changed most of our laws , especially those wherein the English liberties were most transparent , and preserved , and made new laws , and those which he left , writ them all in French ; disweaponed all the natives , sent the children of the best , and most faithful of the nobility into Normandy as hostages , and the most gallant of the English were transported by him into France to serve his wars , that he Might extinguish their families ; he advanced his Normans into all places of the nation , and kept them as a guard over the English ; brought in the cruel forest laws , and dispeopled for thirty miles together in Hampshire , pulling down many towns , and villages , with churches , chapels , and gentleman's houses , making it a forest for wild beasts , ( Which is ever since named the new forest , but was the old ensign of our misery and slavery ) he laid on innumerable taxes , and made laws royal , very severe , and in an unknown language , that the English offending Might forfeit their states and lands to him , which they often did , through ignorance : but alas , what need i mention these ? who ever reads but our histories , ( And the most favourable ▪ and fawning royalist ) will see more than now can be expressed ; and yet here is the first fruits of our Kings and of their righteous title , whose succession hath been as much in tyranny after him , as in title : and yet we must , by a sacred obligation be bound to maintain with our blood , and lives , the branches of this rotten root , notwithstanding all the providential , and divine opportunities of casting off that miserable yoke which our forefathers , so sadly groaned under , and would have triumphed in the pouring out their blood ( Which they shed freely , but to little purpose ) but to have foreseen their children's children Might have but the hopes of attaining to . 

But although William the first made sure his conquest to his own person , yet by his tyranny he gave ground of designs , and hopes of recovery after his death , & therefore the persons who but murmured and mourned in secret formerly , consider now their condition , and that Robert the right heir was wanting , and his second son endeavoured to be set up , begin to capitulate , and repeat their former grievances , and to stand upon their terms , with the next successors ; but William Rufus who longed for the crown , and saw what advantage he had by his brother's absence , through the mediation of Lank-frank the Archbishop of Canterbury ( A man for his virtue and learning in great esteem with the persons ) got himself to be accepted , and crowned King ( With exclusion of his elder brother ) by fair promises , and engagements to repeal his father's laws , and of promoting the liberties of the English ( Any probability being then taking to the poor persons . ) But no sooner had he got the crown fastened on his head , ( And defeated his brother in battle ) but he forgot all his own promises , follows directly his father's steps , grows excessive covetous , lays on intolerable taxes , and merciless exactions , returns their longings , and hopes after their just liberty into a sad bondage and slavery . The poor persons having thus smarted for their credulity , & renewing their sense of their misery , under the two former tyrants , take heart once again , and refuse to admit any after his death , until ( As judge Thorpe well expresseth it in that forementioned discourse ) they were cheated into a second election of hen. the first , his youngest brother ; for the persons standing for their liberties ( And yet , alas , but negatively , rather to be freed from excess of oppression , then knowing what true freedom was ) having felt the misery of their loss in the two former persons ( Shall i call them Kings ? ) Reign ; denied any consent to another person of that stock without solemn capitulations , and covenants to settle just laws , and to engage for the execution of them , with abrogation of all former mischievous and inconvenient ones , ( Which Matthew Paris calls unworthily , a politic , but traitorous way of capitulating . ) Whereupon Henry , who had nothing of title , made friends by his engagements , and Robert's absence in the holy-land , and doth absolutely promise to begin all anew , constitute just laws , reform his fathers , and brother's exorbitancies , and to be as a nursing father both to church and state ; these fair insinuations got him the crown , though Robert was to have it first by his own right , and next by his brother's covenant and will . 

And that he Might not seem altogether disproportionable to his engagement , the first action of his government was to bait the persons , and sugar their subjection , as his predecessor in the like interposition had done , but with more moderation and advisedness ; but having once secured his title from his brothers jus , and settled some affairs abroad , began much after the old strain , ( Yet not altogether so violent ) yet these cruel and savage laws of the forest he revived , and put in execution , yea , urged as the most fundamental law of the realm , and many sore in positions he levied ( Which the persons were not able to bear ; ) that these two sons , though they ended the direct line , yet they propagated their father's tyranny ; only he got the throne by force ; they by subtlety , and delusive engagements ; and now the poor persons , who had still been cozened , and are commonly passive , begin in the next King's reign , ( viz. of Stephen , another usurper ) to be active , and to struggle for their liberties more seriously and thoroughly , and not contented with promises of abating former pressures , drew up the sum of their desires in a more exact method , and demand publicly the restoring and re-establishing of St.  Edward's laws ( For such a rarity was that former Prince , as they canonised him a saint ) which were many years before granted ▪ but by new and strange successions buried ; and Stephen , who came in oddly to the crown , and was continually in various motions to maintain it , confirmed all these laws , and to gain the persons , ratified them by parliament , the best security in these cases ; but soon after prerogative ( Like a lion in chains ) breaks forth again with fuller rage , and devours all these grants , with the hopes , and expectations of the persons ; for though in the two next Kings reigns these grants were not actually repeled , yet were laid by , and only wrapped up in parchments , and hushed by the noise of drums , and trumpets . For Henry the second , the next King , spent most of his time in clearing the controversy ▪ between regnum & sacerdotium , the crown and the mitre , as in settling his own title both here , and in Normandy ▪ and Ireland ; a while he and Thomas Becket were standing in the special rights , and privileges of the church , and state , the liberties of the persons were laid asleep , and certainly he hated the former grants , because made by Stephen , who had stolen the crown both from his mother , and himself ; the notablest story in this King's reign ( Setting by his warlike achievements ) is , that after Becket had often foiled him in his authority , he was handsomely whipped by the monks , in going to visit Becket's shrine , which was part of his penance , for giving secret order to assasinats to make him away ; and that he kept Rosamond as his concubine , to the vexation of Elinor his wife , who at last vented her revenge on her , having found her out in that intricate labyrinth made on purpose for her at Woodstock , by the clew which Rosamond had carelessly untwisted . 

The next that laid claim to this crown , was his son Richard the first , surnamed ceur de lion ( As before ) who was to be commended rather for his personal valour , in other nations , then for any good done to this ; he began well in enlarging his mother Elinor , whom his father had imprisoned , because she could not abide his lascivious living with his wanton paragon Rosamond , and advanced many persons by special favours ; yet these respects were more particular , then of any public advantage to the state ; for out of a blind zeal in those times , after he had been in England but four months after his coronation , he went into the holy-land , against the Turks , leaving the regency of the kingdom to an ecclesiastical person , William Longchampe , Bishop of Ely , who to please the King , and by special command , undid the persons , and committed great exactions , and as Hoveden says , clerum & populum opprimebat , confundens fasque nefasque did all as he listed , and little cared by what means he filled the King's coffers , and his own ; ( Acting but by proxy and in imitation of what his Master would have done , if at home ▪ & by many a private command ) as it afterwards proved ; for when Richard undertook this voyage , that he Might not seem at first burdensome to the persons when he left them , and to maintain both his design , and absence on their purses ( And so alienate their affections from him when at so great a distance , and give grounds to his brother John to try an experiment for the title ) wifely sold much of his own estate to raise him monies , as the castles of Berwick ▪ and Roxborough , to the King of Scots for ten thousand pounds , and the lordship , and earldom of Durham , to Hugh then Bishop of that see , for much money , as also many honours , lordships , manors , offices , privileges , royalties , to many of the nobles , and rich commoners , whereby he furnished himself with a vast treasury of money for that service ; and that you May see what interest he and his companions think they have in his people's goods ( However they dissemble it ) he often protested that he would sell his city of London ( As my author saith ) to any that would by it , rather than be chargeable unto others ; but notwithstanding all this , as the persons were sadly oppressed in his absence by his viceroy , so much more when he returned by himself ; for he then began to redeem his time , and to play rex with a witness ; he fell presently to plunder all religious houses , laid on new and unheard of taxes on the persons , and resumed into his hands again all the lordships , manors , castles , &c. which he had sold to his subjects , and confirmed it by all the security they could have from man ; this is the misery of depending on royal promises , and engagements , which are usually nothing else but complemental engines to move up the people's affections , while they more easily , and insensibly drain out their blood , and purses , this was the end of this rough , and lionlike King , who reigned nine years , and nine months , wherein he exacted and consumed more of this kingdom than all his predecessors from the Norman had done before him , and yet less deserved it then any , having neither lived here , nor left behind him monument of piety , or any public work , or ever showed love or care to this commonwealth , but only to get what he could from it ; we see hitherto what a race of Kings we have had , and what cause we have to glory in any thing but their tombs ; and yet if we expect better afterwards , we shall be as much mistaken of their actings as they were of their right . 

The next that reigned ( Though without any hereditary title ) was King John , Stephen's brother ; whose government was as unjust as his title , for he ( Having by election , out of fear and policy of state , got the crown , with expulsion of Arthur the right heir ut supra ) embarked the state , and himself in these miserable encumbrances , through his violence and oppression , as produced desperate effects , and made way to those great alterations in the government which followed ; the whole reign of this King was a perfect tyranny ; there is in history hardly one good word given him ; the Barons and clergy continually opposed him , struggling for a confirmation of their long desired liberties , but were most commonly either cluded , or defeated by promises which were never intended to be performed , until at last being more entirely united with the Commons , and stoutly resolved and confirmed by an oath , taken at St. Edmunds-bury in a general assembly , they then swore on the high altar , never to lay down arms , if King John refused to confirm and restore unto them these liberties ( The rights which this kingdom was formerly blessed with , and which all the late Kings had cheated them of ) the King knowing their power , and considering their engagements , makes use of policy , and desired time to answer them , entertaining them with smooth and gentle language , and courtesy , until he had got strength , and then he began anew to try experiments of securing himself , and frustrating their desires : but the Lords continuing their resolution , and knowing nothing was to be obtained but by strong hand , assemble themselves with a great army at Stamford , from whence they Marched towards the King , who was then at Oxford ; sent him a schedule of their claimed liberties , with an appendix of their absolute resolutions , in case of his denial ; this tyrant having heard them read , with much passion replies : why do they not demand the kingdom as well ? and swore he would never grant these liberties , whereby himself should be made a servant ▪ the Barons upon his answer being ( As Daniel saith ) as hasty as he was averse , resolve to seize on his castles , and possessions ; and repairing to London , being welcomed by the citizens , who had too long groaned under the same tyranny , they get a great access of strength by new confederates , and renew their spirits & oaths for the thorough prosecution of the war ; the King seeing himself in a strait , which by no ordinary strength he could evade , by gentle and teeming messages sent to the Barons , he obtained a conference in a meadow called running-mead , between Windsor and Sta•es , where armed multitudes came from all places , crying nothing but liberty , liberty , so sweet was that tone to them then : after many hard conferences , the King seeing it no time to dally , & that they would not trust him with any complemental expressions , whom they looked on as formerly perjured , grants their desires ; not only , saith Speed , for liberties specified in magna charta & charta forrestae , but also for a kind of sway in the government , by five and twenty selected peers , who were to be as a check over the King , and his chief justiciar , and all his officers to whom any appeal Might be made in case of breach of any article or privilege confirmed by that charter ; and now one would think the persons were secure enough ; but though they seem now to have the livery , yet they had not the seisin ; for presently the King having got now credit by the largeness of his grants , gets liberty with less suspicion to undo all ; and in a short time ( Pretending these grants to be acts of force ) having got power , renounceth his engagement by them , and afterwards repeals them , and despoiled all these of their lands and possessions , who had any hand , or heart in procuring the former grants ; and by new , and additional laws made them more perfect slaves then ever they were before , until at last he was poisoned by a monk , instead of being deposed . 

But though he be dead , yet the miseries of this nation ended not with him ; for his son Henry the third ; who succeeded him , though he could not at first follow on his father's designs , being an infant , yet at last did not only imitate , but outstrip him , yet the English nation , ( Who are much given to credulity , and apt to be won by fair and plausible promises , ) notwithstanding all the father's iniquity , embrace the son , having taken an oath of him to restore , and confirm the liberties they propounded to his father , which he had often granted , and as often broken ; but for all his first oath , they were fain , not only to remember him of it , by petitions , but oftentimes by arms and strength . And though there was in this King's reign twenty one parliaments called , and many great subsidies granted , in confirmation of their liberties , yet every parliament was no sooner dissolved , but the engagement ceased ; a hint of two or three special parliaments , and their success will not be amiss to be set down in this place . 

This King not being able to suppress the Barons and persons by his own strength , ( They having gotten not only heart , but power ) sends to foreign nations for aid , and entertains poictovines , Italians , Almains , provincioes to subdue his own persons , and set them in great places ; which dangerous and desperate design the Barons much resenting , raised their spirits , and engaged them in opposition to his government , and set them on with more courage to look after their liberties ; therefore they several times stand up against the violence of prerogative ; but what through want of strength or caution they were commonly disappointed ; yet rather ( If we May speak truly ) from the unfaithfulness of the King than any other defect , except it were their easiness to believe Kings , when their prerogative , and the people's liberties came in competition ; for after they had many times got , or rather extorted many promises , and confirmed them by oaths , ( The best human security ) they were put to new designs , through either the suspension , or breach of them , witness these instances ; after many foils ▪ and tedious and various delusions by this King ( Whose beams attracted most , dazzled others ) the Barons , and persons ( Who were then unanimous through mutual oppressions ) fall more close , and severe on their principles , and will not endure either delays , or delusions , and therefore effectually to redress their grievances , came very well armed to a parliament then holden at Oxford ( Intended rather for getting subsidies , then removing oppressions ) in which assembly they put the King to it , urge their former complaints with more zeal and reason , and with an addition of a mighty spirit , demand the absolute confirmation of magna charta , and in a larger edition ( Wherein are comprised those gallant privileges of the Commons of England , which have yet been but kept by ink , and parchment ) and not trusting the King , got his son , Prince Edward , to seal it , with an addition of twenty four ( Some write twelve ) peers which Fabian styles the douze peers , not only to see these privileges truly observed , but to be as joint regents with the King ; and all the Lords , and Bishops in parliament took a like oath , to maintain these articles inviolable ; yea , and all that would have any benefit of residence in the kingdom , were enjoined to take the same ; but these were too strict bonds for such a Princes will , he soon finding advantages ( As he sought them ) recals all , gets a dispensation from the Pope for his forced oath and to countenance his perjury ▪ and acts in the old account ; the Barons again stand up with the persons stoutly for the performance of the articles of Oxford ; and sometimes brought him into straits ; yea , fully ▪ defeated him in many bloody battles , and regained the confirmation of the same laws , with security ; that all the castles throughout England should be delivered to the keeping of the Barons , that the provisions of Oxford be inviolably preserved , that all strangers should be dismissed the kingdom , but those which by general consent should be thought fit to remain ; this necessitous act though as it gave the persons some peace and hopes , so it gave the King time to consider of new mediums , and therefore still to delay , and blind , he assembles a new parliament at London , where having ( By the sprinkling of court water ) won many Lords to take his part , begins to surprise as many of the Barons as he could get , and spoilt their castles and houses , that success and authority grows strong on his side , and the Barons with some calm provisoes mediate a peace , insisting only in general that the articles of Oxford Might be observed ; but the King relying on his strength , defies them as traitors ; which done , the people's two generals , the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester , seeing no other means but to put it to a day , supply their want of strength by their wit and diligence , and carefully and artificially placing their battle ( Which was fought at the town of Lewis in Sussex ) overthrew the King's army , took the King , the Prince , the Earl of Cornwall , and his son Henry , the Earls of Arundel , Hereford , with many other Lords , and gentlemen , both English and Scottish . 

And now having the King , and Prince , and most of the nobles , and a new confirmation of all , one would think the great charter was out of danger , either of blotting or razing ; especially if we consider the solemnities formerly used in the ratification of it , ( As Daniel excellently relates it in his history , p. 169. ) The persons knowing that no civil promises , or verbal professions would hold in Kings raptured by prerogative ▪ & devoted to perjury to maintain their tyranny , take a more ecclesiastical and divine way of obligation , swearing to excommunicate all that should be found infringers of that charter ; when the persons with the King , and all the great nobility were assembled with all the prelates , and the chief Bishops in their reverent ornaments ( With burning candles in their hands ) to receive that dreadful sentence ; the King having one great candle in his hand , gives it to a prelate that stood by , saying , it becomes not me being no priest to hold this candle , my heart shall be a greater testimony ; and withal laid his hand spread on his breast all the while the sentence was pronouncing , which was authoritato omnipotentis dei , &c. which done , he caused the charter of King John his father to be read , and in the end having thrown away their candles ( Which lay smoking on the ground ) they cried out , so let them that incur this sentence be extinct and stink in hell ; and the King with a loud voice said , as God help , i will , as i am a man , a Christian , a knight , a King crowned and anointed , inviolably observe these things . never were laws saith he ( Whose words express the thing most emphatically ) amongst men ( Except those holy commandments from the mount ) established with more majesty of ceremony , to make them reverenced , and respected , than these were ; they wanted but thunder , and lightning from heaven , ( Which likewise if prayers could have effected they would have had it ) to make the sentence ghastly , and hideous to the breakers of it ; the greatest security that could be given was an oath ( The only chain on earth besides love , to tie the conscience of a man , and human society together ) which should it not hold us , all the frame of government must needs fall quite asunder ; yet so ( Almost a miracle ( Though over common among our Kings , saith Master Prin out of mat. Paris ) the parliament being thus dissolved ( By a sacred and most solemn conclusion ) the King presently studies how to infringe all the premises , his parasites telling him the Pope could soon absolve him for a sum of money , which afterwards the Pope did , and the King returned to his former oppressive courses with more violence , and hardness ; and taking advantage by the division of the Barons , two generals , the Earls of Leicester and Gloucester , the latter of which joined with the young Prince Edward , and Sir Roger Mortimer the King's wicked counsellor , a new and potent army is raised by them , against the Earl of Leicester ( Who had the King prisoner ) and those which kept constant with him for the people's liberties ; and he with the rest of the Barons , are overthrown ; and immediately after a parliament is called , and all these laws and decrees made void ; and that parliament held at Oxford , wherein all these laws were first confirmed by him , called insanum parliamentum , the mad parliament ; and all these patents , commissions or instruments made to ratify these articles , were brought forth , and solemnly damned ; and so bright and resplendent did prerogative break forth , that it was proclaimed treason in any but to speak or mention any of these grants with the least approbation ; and because the city of London had engaged with the Barons and persons as a principal part of the whole , he would needs have burned the city , had not some wise and potent favourites interposed , and yet they could hardly dissuade him from that barbarous and impolitic wickedness ; but what he spared in their houses , that he got out of their purses , and made up all his losses with a thorough subjection of their persons , and suppression of their liberties . I need relate no more of this King , nor make observations , the reader will be amazed at the repetition ; he at least 20 times gave his promise for the confirmation , & execution of these just decrees ( Contained in magna charta ) and as many times was perjured , notwithstanding all the solemnities , both civil , moral , and ecclesiastical , used in the acts of ratification ; this May learn us how to trust the most positive engagements of Princes , which cross their own interest , and what to think of that word and promise they call royal ; this King reigned fifty six years , the longest of any King of England : but we have had too much of the story of him , as he had too long a time to rule , considering his temper , and design . it 's well if we can be wary for the future , and be more cautious then to trust the most promising and insinuating Princes with our liberties , and privileges , which can be no longer expected to be preserved by them , than they May serve as footstools to advance them in the throne of absolute majesty , but no more of this King ; never were there more hard strivings and wrestlings between tyranny and liberty , with such bad success to the persons ; i only conclude his reign with the exhortation of the psalmist , psal. 146. 3.  Oh put not your confidence in Princes , surely men of high degree are a lie . 

King Henry is by this time laid in his grave , and one would think magna charta buried with him ; his son Edward , who was his right-hand in his wars against the Barons , and the principal agent in their ruin , succeeds him in the throne ; and instead of lessening goes on and makes an higher improvement of that royalty which his father left him ; having in his own person got the victory over the people's liberties in his father's time , and having won or worn out the greatest of those which opposed , and being long experienced in the world , so secured and advanced the prerogative , that as one saith , he seemed to be the first conqueror after the conqueror that got the domination of this state in so absolute and eminent a manner , as by his government appears ; he laid unsupportable taxes both on the clergy and laity , even unto fiveteens and halfs of their estates ▪ as for tenths , that was comparatively accounted easy ; the Barons and persons for a long time durst not move for removal of greivances , until that the King ( Being always in wars in France , Flanders , Wales and Scotland , and so needed continually vast sums of money ) called a parliament wherein he demanded a great treasure of money from the persons , that he Might give them somewhat in lieu of their expenses , confirmed the two great charters on the petition of the Barons and persons , ( And so stopped their mouths ) and this he did as often as he had extraordinary occasions for money ; but ( Like all other royal promises ) they were performed by leisure . Never was royalty more majestic and glorious then in this King's reign , and the persons less able to oppose ; he was always so watchful and eager to enlarge his own power ; i shall end his reign also with what Daniel that impartial and witty historian saith of him , he was more for the greatness of the kingdom than the quiet of it ; and never King before or since ( except our last Charles ) shed so much Christian blood within this isle of Britain , and was the cause of more in that following , and not one grain of benefit procured unto the persons by all their expenses on him , which was but to make themselves more perfect slays . 

The next King was Edward the second his son , who though more vicious than the father , yet not more tyrannical ; he gave more advantage to the persons through his lewd life and unmartial nature , to seek the confirmation and establishment of magna charta , and other good laws which were utterly suppressed , and darkened in his father's reign . This Prince gave himself over to all wicked courses , and surrendered his judgement , and the management of all affairs of state unto evil and corrupt counsellors ; especially to one Peirce Gaveston , who had both his ear and heart , unto whom he was so much endeared , that he ventured the loss of kingdom , and all the hearts of his subjects for his company , and preservation ; and though the Barons had by often petitions , and earnest solicitations prevailed with the King to banish him , yet he soon after sent for him home , and laid him more nigh his bosom then before ; on this the Barons raise an army against the King ; and send him word , that unless he would observe the late articles ( Which they had formerly by much ▪ ado got him to sign in parliament ) and put from him pierce Gaveston , they would rise in arms against him as a perjured Prince ; the King ( Whom they found , was apt to be terrified ) yields again to his banishment , with this clause , that if he were found again within the kingdom he should be condemned to death as an enemy of the state : all places were now dangerous to Gaveston ; both Ireland ( Where he formerly was protected ) & France also too hot for him ; in this extremity , finding no security anywhere else , he again adventures on England , and puts himself once again into the King's bosom ( A sanctuary which he thought would not be polluted with blood ) and there he is received with as great joy as ever man could be ; the Lords with more violence prosecute their suit to the King for delivering up ▪ or removing him once more ; but to no purpose ; they therefore set forward with an army , say siege to the castle wherein Gaveston was , took him , and notwithstanding the King's earnest solicitation for his life , they condemned him to the block , and took off his head ; this obstacle being removed out of the way , the Lords having now the better end of the staff make advantages of it for demanding the confirmation , and execution of all those articles formerly granted , threatening the King , that if he would not consent to it , they would force him by a strong hand ; with this message they had their swords also drawn , and March towards London : a parliament is called , where the King , after a submission by the Lords to him , for that act done against Gaveston , contrary to his consent , and will , grants the articles and pardon to them . But the King goes on his old way , adheres to wicked counsel ( Waving the grave advice of his parliament ) and is ruled by the two Spencers , who acted with mighty strain of injustice , which caused the Lords again to take up arms , and stand for their liberties , but are , through the revolt of some , and the treachery of others overthrown at Burton upon Trent , and two and twenty noblemen , the greatest peers in the realm executed in several places for nothing but opposing his evil counsellors ▪ this was the first blood of nobility that ever was shed in this manner in England since William the first , which being so much , opened veins for more to follow ; and now the beam of power being turned , regality weighs down all . But by degrees , through the continuation of his ill government , whereby he daily lost the people's hearts , the Lords get an army , and take the King prisoner , and by general consent in parliament deposed him as a tyrant , and elected his son Edward the third to succeed , and his son was crowned before his eyes . Thus ended his reign , but not his life . 

Poor England which had laboured so long and successively under so many tyrants , and had contested so long with royalty for their dearly purchased liberties , Might now hopefully expect at least a dawning of reformation , especially when they had got so much power as to depose authority ; and began , as it were , on a new account ; and the truth is , affairs were now promising , and distempers seemed to wear away with the former governor ; yet the condition of the kingdom , had but a new face on it , and grievances were rather not aggravated or multiplied then any whit removed , and oppressions May be rather said to be changed from one shoulder to another then abolished . 

Prince Edward who succeeded , who was crowned in his father's life , had observance enough to remember his fate , and was much warned by it , both to prevent and suppress insurrections , knowing by experience the full state of the controversy , and therefore began his government very fairly , and with much applause ; only to prevent factions , and sidings , he privately caused his father , the deposed King to be cruelly murdered , and so sat more securely , though with more guilt upon the throne ; his reign was fifty years , & odd months , the longest next hen. the third ; he spent most of his time in the wars of France to regain his titile to that crown , which the poor subject felt in their estate and families , and it was a happiness ( Say some ) that he was so much abroad ; for when ever he came home , as he wanted money to supply his expenses , so the persons got ground to urge their privileges , & magna charta was at least twelve times ratified in this King's reign , and so often broken ; yet because he goes under the name of the best Prince that reigned so long , and so well , let the reader take but an instance or two concerning his engagements to perform the grand charter . This King in the first parliament made the fifteenth year of his reign , had granted the enacting of divers wholesome and seasonable laws , which he willed and engaged unto for him and his heirs , that they should be firmly kept , and remain inviolable for ever , for the ratification of magna charta , and other good laws formerly enacted ; and that all the officers of state , as chancellor , treasurer , Barons of the exchequer , judges , &c. should at that present in parliament , and for ever after , take a solemn oath before their admission to their offices , to keep and maintain the point of the great charter , and the charter of the forest , &c.  but no sooner was the parliament dissolved , but the very same year he publicly revoked these statutes , pretending that they were contrary to the laws and customs of the realm , and to his prerogative and rights royal , &c. wherefore we are willing ( Saith he ) providently to revoke these things we have so improvidently done ; because ( Saith he ) mark the dissimulation of Princes even in parliaments ) we never really consented to the making of such statutes , but as then it behooved us , we dissembled in the premises , by protestations of revocation , if indeed they should proceed to secure the dangers , which by denying the same we feared to come , with many more such passages ; and yet this King is the phoenix of our more ancient monarchs ; but the reader May still learn what the best of our Princes have been , and what weak assurances any engagements from them are where power is wanting from them , and advantages present to them . 

Another instance of his actings we May take up from the success of his first siege of tourney in France ; having laid on heavy and excessive taxes to maintain that war , and the persons seeing no fruits of all promises for executing the articles of magna charta , they refuse to pay any more , without more faithful performance of his vows , and solemn engagements to them , whereby he wanting money was fain to quit the place , and return for England , full of revengeful thoughts , and in much fury breathes out destruction to all the refusers ; but the Archbishop of Canterbury told him publicly , but plainly , that he had oftentimes as well as his father offered manifest violences to the liberties of the English nation , comprehended in that grand charter , and if he expected subsidies , from the persons , he must more carefully maintain their privileges so justly due . But the King vexed with such language , both storms against the Archbishop , and as much as possibly he then could , sought the ruin of all that had made any refusal of payment of these taxes , although he had not in any manner performed his own promises . Yet i will end his reign , because he hath a name of a good King . ( Though as Speed saith , by the general vote of historians , he committed many foul errors in his government ) with a good act he did at the fiftieth year of his age ( Which he kept as his jubilee ) he called a parliament , and there freely heard the grievances of the persons , and redressed many , especially a petition of the Commons against the doublings of lawyers ; he caused the pleas which were before in French to be made in English ; a necessary law ( Saith Speed ) if it had been as carefully observed ; especially if he had ordered ( Saith he ) that the same should not have been written in French , that the subject Might understand the law , by which he holds what he hath , and is to know what he doth . but all this is not for nothing ; for as he imparted grace unto his persons ( Saith the same author ) for so all acts of justice are termed , wh•n granted by Kings , so he took a care to replenish his own purse by it , that the poor Commons obtain not any thing which they pay not too dearly for . 

Here ends the life of the best reputed Prince ; and yet you see wherein his excellency lay ; the best happiness the persons had in his reign , was ▪ that they had more engagements for their liberties with more cost , and the remembrances and sense of the goodness of them more fresh and sweet by the often repetition of them ; but for execution or addition to them , they were as far to seek as in former times . And if it do possibly happen that in one King's reign either through the goodness of his nature , or rather want of advantages , there be an intermission of oppressions , ( For that is the utmost to be expected ) yet the next King will be sure to make it up , and if they give the persons a little breath , it 's but that they May sow for the next to reap , or as they do with men on the rack , let them down , and give them cordials , and spiritful liquors , that they May be the longer and more sensibly tormented ; which was made good in the next King's reign , viz. Richard the second , who presently dashes and utterly nips these blossoms that sprung out in the former King's reign , devoting himself to all uncivil and lewd courses , and to enable him the better unto it , lays on sad and miserable taxes on the persons without so much as a mention or hint of their liberties , and as the parallel of Edward the second , both lived and died ; it 's enough to decipher his reign by his end ; for he was deposed by the universal consent of the persons in parliament as a tyrannical , and cruel governor , and not a good word spoken of him to commend him in his government , and its pity to aggravate his misery after his death , and yet ( As we say ) seldom comes a better ; when one is cut off , another like the Hidra's head springs up in his place . Henry the fourth who overthrew him in battle , and was made King in his stead ( Though by a wrong title ) at first promised the new modelling of laws to the people's ease , and did , as in a compliment ( Rather to secure his title , then out of affection to the persons , or sense of his relation ) redress many grievances , which were more gross and less concerning the commonwealth ; and as he did strive by these common acts to engage the persons to him , so ( As one that had continual sense of guilt on him ) he got the deposed King to be barbarously murdered in the castle of Pomfret , that no competition Might endanger his title by his life ; he spent most of his reign incontinuall wars about his title , and was often opposed as both a tyrant and usurper ; but he still got ground on both the liberties and laws formerly granted ; yet not so sensibly as in the former Kings reigns , that the persons May be said to have a little respite from the violence & height of prerogative by him ; but they May thank the unjustness , and brittleness of his title , for that he being more in fear of of losing it , than out of love with the excess of his ancestors . I shall only add one story to conclude this King's reign , which is universally reported by most of our historians , worth observation , because it hath much of ingenuity in it , and because they were his dying words ; being cast into an apoplexy , and nigh his end , he caused his crown to be placed by him on his pillow , least in the extremity of his sickness it Might have been delivered to some other , who had better right thereunto then he had ; but when his attendants , ( Through the violence of his distemper , supposed him to be dead , the young Prince of Wales seized on his crown , whereat the King started up raising himself on his arms , demanded who it was that had so boldly taken away the crown ? the Prince answered that it was he ; the King fell back into his bed , and fetching a deep sigh , and sending forth many a pensive groan , replies thus ; my son , what right i had to this crown ; and how i have enjoyed it , God knows , and the world hath seen ; but the Prince , ( Ambitious enough of a diadem ) answered him thus ; comfort yourself in God ( Good father ) ; the crown you have ; and if you die , i will have it and keep it with my sword as you have done ; and so he did soon after , maintaining his father's injustice by his own . 

And now comes up his son Henry the fifth as the next heir , who though while a Prince was given to many wicked practices , yet when a King , became moderate , and hath better commendation than most of his ancestors ; the persons had two advantages and comforts by him ; first , that his reign was short , and that he was much employed in the war with France for regaining a title to that crown , which he accomplished , and so they were free of civil wars ; though they had still heavy taxes , yet they thought it better to pay for maintaining war abroad then at home ; and truly , the persons thought themselves very happy in this King's reign , ( Though their privileges were laid asleep ) that they had a little breathing time from domestic and civil wars , and had hopes to regain by degrees a reviving of their spirits . 

But the next King , Henry the sixth , makes up what was wanting of tyranny and oppression in his father's reign . He was crowned King about the eighth or ninth month of his age , and so had not present opportunity to show his royalty . Until he came to age , the kingdom was well governed by his three uncles , Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester , John Duke of Bedford , Thomas Duke of Excester , who by their wisdom and justice , kept up the flourishing estate of the English nation ; but when his years of nonage were expired , and he came to wield the sceptre with his own hands , ( What as some favourably think out of weakness , for he was no Solomon ) all things went presently out of order , and prerogative breaks forth beyond bounds ; which gave occasion to Edward Duke of York to try conclusions for his title against the house of Lancaster , and making use of the discontents of the persons through his evil government , opposed him , and afterwards deposed him , and reigned in his stead by the name of Edward the fourth , and so by conquest he got the title to run through the house of York , having cut it off by his sword from the house of Lancaster ; notwithstanding actual possession of three descents , many overtures of war were yet between them ; for Henry was not yet dead , though for the present outed ; but as a dying man strove for life , but being quite overthrown was imprisoned , and afterwards murdered to secure the title ; there was in these two Kings reign but merely for a title fought ten bloody battles , besides all lesser skirmishes , wherein many thousands of Lords , gentlemen , and Commons were slain , and yet not one jot of advantage gotten by it for the people's liberties ; it being the misery and folly of the persons to venture all they have , to set up those over them who afterwards prove most tyranni call , and to sow seeds of future misery , by spilling their bloods for a usurped title . 

In this King's reign , as in the former , the whole land was miserably rent by unnatural divisions against his title , and government ; and though neither or these two had a just title ( If we will begin from the root ) yet all the blood of the nation is thought too little to be spilt to maintain their pretences ; yet we May not reckon this King among the worst , had it not fallen out that his title must be kept up with expense of so much blood and ruin of the English nation ; yet in his last five years , he laid on such extraordinary taxes , and changed the form of laws , that he lost the love of all his subjects . 

For Edward the fifth his son , who succeeded him in title , we need but mention him , for he had but the name of a King ( Being an infant ) and his reign May well be called an inter-regnum , for ere he came to know what government was , he was cruelly murdered with his infant brother , by his uncle rich.  Duke of Gloucester , who reigned both for him , and afterwards for himself by the name of Richard the third , a bloody and cruel man , rather a monster than a Prince , his name stinks in the English dialect ; the shortness of his reign was the happiness of the persons ; for after three years' usurpation , he was slain in the field by the Earl of Richmond , who by his valour , more than his title got the crown by the name of Henry the seventh ; this was the best act that was done by him , in easing the kingdom of such a viper . In his reign ( Who is the first root of our King's since ) the persons had more hopes than benefits , and were rejoiced and made happy more by expectations , than enjoyments of any real privilege , or liberty . For though he took all the ways to secure his title by his marriage with the Lady Elizabeth daughter to Edward the fourth , yet many stratagems were laid to disturb his peace , which put him on acts of policy , and diligence , ( Which he excellently demonstrated ) to free and extricate himself out of dangers and designs ; many sad divisions were still in the kingdom , all men were not pleased either with his title or government , and that they Might but disturb him , or hazard his crown , they made stage Kings , dressed up pretty lads in princely robes , and carried them up and down the kingdom as puppets for the persons to gaze one , and admire ; all this while King Henry had not time to advance his prerogative , while he was but securing his title ; but after he had done that , and now began to look on himself as free from either foreign or home competitors , and the coast of state seeming clear from all thickening weather , he thinks of redeeming what he had lost by factions , and employs his wit for bringing down the height of the English nation , and plucking down their courage , and was especially ( Saith one ) jealous over his nobility , as remembering how himself was set up ; and how much more did this humour increase in him after he had conflicted with such idols and counterfeits as Lambert Simnel & Perkin Warbeck ? the strangeness of which dangers made him think nothing safe ; and thinking that the riches of the English occasioned their rebellions , he took a course to empty their coffers into his ; and the plot whereby he meant to effect it was by taking the advantage of the breach of penal laws , which he both found , and made for that purpose ; his instruments which for this work were picked , and qualified sufficiently , were Sir Richard Empson , and Edmund Dudley , men learned in the law , and of desperate and subtle heads , and forward in executing the King's commands ; these two attended by troops of base informers , promoters , catchpoles , cheaters , knights of the post &c. went up and down the kingdom , cruelly polled and taxed all sorts of persons , and prosecute in every shire the most deserving and generous men , that the kingdom in a little time was more beggared , then by most of the former civil wars ; and all this done by the King's special command , and countenance , that we May see what was the reason he began not sooner to play rex ; want of opportunity , and fear of losing his crown while he was advancing it ; but the latter end of his reign was too soon , and too long for such actings . This King ends his reign with the greatest acts of tyranny ; he made himself a rich King by beggaring his subjects ; after he had freed his own person out of danger ▪ he employs all his wits to enslave the English ; the fruits both of his title and tyranny we have felt ever sense in these that followed him . 

His son Henry the eighth of that name , succeeds him ; in his first beginnings he seemed to be tenderly affected to the commonwealth , and redressed many grievances , especially those which were laid on by his father , and executed by Empson and Dudley , doing justice on them for their cruelty and oppression . But those affections were too good , and too violent to last long ; the sound of drums and trumpets soon quashed them , and many encroachments grew on the people's liberties ; many tempestuous storms and controversies there were in this King's reign ; but they were more ecclesiastical than civil , and so more dangerous and strong . In a word , he was accounted a better soldier than a governor , and more fit for a general than a King to govern by just and equal laws ; the best act he did , was the discovery of the wickedness of the clergy , and casting off the Pope's supremacy , which yet he took to himself , and annexed it to his own crown ; as the most of his reign was full of controversies and tempests , so all affairs were managed in a ranting and turbulent manner , not with that gravity & soberness as becomes civil and prudential transactions ; he was very lascivious , and delighted much in variety , and changes of laws , as wives ; he oftentimes much pleased himself to be in the company , and was over-familiar with swaggering and loose fellows ; and the persons ever and anon found the power of his prerogative at home , as his enemies did of his sword abroad . Edward the sixth his only son succeeds him , a Prince that was too good to live long , the phoenix of English Kings , had he had time to prosecute his intentions and mature his genius ; but the sun in him did shine too bright in the morning ; God gave England only the representation of a good King , but would not in judgement let us be blessed long with him ; religion began to revive , liberty to bud forth , the persons to peep out of their graves of slavery and bondage , and to have their blood fresh and blushing in their cheeks ; but all is presently blasted by his death , and the persons ( Who have seldom more than hopes for their comforts ) are now fainting for fear ; England is benighted ; and hung with black ; Queen Mary that Allecto , and fury of women succeeds ; and now both souls and bodies of the persons are enslaved , and nothing but bone fires made of the flesh and bones of the best Christians : but it 's too much to name her in the English tongue ; Queen Elizabeth succeeds her , who being prepared for the crown by suffering , came in a most seasonable time , both for herself and the persons , who were made fuel for the flames of her sister's devotion . 

And now England begins to flourish again , and to recover its strength ; many enlargements were granted , both to the consciences , and estates of the persons ; yet if we speak impartially , we were kept further off Rome , than royalty ; yet doubtless she May be chronicled for the best Princess , and her reign the most even , and best managed , with more fruits to the persons than any of the former Kings , especially if we consider how long she governed this nation ; i end her reign with this character , that she was the best Queen that ever England had , and the glory of her sex to all ages . 

The English line is now ended ; we must go into Scotland to seek for a King , because a daughter of Henry the seventh was married to James the fourth , King of Scotland ; but i will not question his title . 

King James the sixth of Scotland , and first of England , succeeded on the English throne ; a Prince that had many advantages to set up prerogative , which he improved ; he was too timorous to act , but most subtle in council and designs , and no King did more insensibly and closely undermine the liberties of England then himself ; he gave us cause to remember from whence he came ; but his peaceable reign was the rail to his design , and did choke suspicion ; we were brought by him very nigh Rome and Spain , and yet knew it not ; he had an inveterate hatred against Puritans , as he had a fear of Papists , and made more of Bishops then ordinary by remembrance of the Scots presbytery ; he had as much of royalty in his eye as any Prince could have , but had not so much courage to prosecute it ; the Puritan always lay in his spleen , the Papist on his lungs , that he durst not , that he could not breathe so clearly and strongly against them ; but the Bishops lay in his heart . I will not rip up his personal failings after his death ; he was the most profane King for oaths and blasphemies that England had besides , &c.  he now grows old ▪ and was judged only fit to lay the plot , but not to execute it ; the design being now ripe , and his person and life the only obstacle and remora to the next instrument , he is conveyed away suddenly into another world , as his son Henry was , because thought unsuitable to the plot , it being too long to wait , until nature and distemper had done the deed . 

We are now come to our last Charles ( Who is like to end both that race and its tyranny ) the perfect idea of all the rest , and the most zealous prosecutor of the designs of all his ancestors , who , if divine providence had not miraculously prevented , had accomplished the utmost of their intentions , and for ever darkened the glory of the English sun ; so much i must say of him , that he got more wisdom by action , then could possibly be expected by his nature ; experience that teacheth fools , made him wise ; he endeavoured to act what others designed ; he dissembled as long as he could , and used all parties to the utmost ; but his zeal and hardiness brought him to his death . He needed no physic for his body , had he remembered his soul . But what need i mention him ? he is the last of English monarchs , and the most absolute monument of monarchy , and example of tyranny and injustice that ever was known in England ; he would have been what other Kings are , and endeavoured to attain what others would be ; he lived an enemy to the commonwealth , and died a martyr to prerogative . 

Thus you have seen a faithful representation of the Norman race , under which we have groaned for about six hundred years ; the first title made only by the invasion and conquest of a stranger and bastard , continue by usurpation and tyranny , that take away but two or three persons out of the list ( And yet these bad enough if we consider all things ) and all this while England neither had a right heir , or good King to govern it ; and yet by delusion and deceit we must be bound to maintain that title as sacred and divine , which in the beginning was extorted and usurping ▪ as if grey hairs could add reverence to injustice . England hath now an advantage more than all its ancestors , of freeing itself from this successive slavery , and interrupting that bloody line , and after an apprenticeship to bondage for so many hundred years , providence hath given us our own choice ; if we take it we are made ; if not , the old judgement of God lies on us for our stupidity , and blindness . For my part , as i do not give much to that monkish prophecy from Henry the seventh times ; Mars , puer , Allecto , Virgo , vulpes , leo , nullus ( Yet i wonder how the devil could foresee so far off , and must needs say that it hath yet been literally fulfilled ▪ both in the characters of the persons , and the issue ) yet i must so far give way to the power of divine actings on my faith , as to think that either we shall never have a King more , or else we shall have one sent of God in wrath , as the Israelites had , seeing we are not contented that way which God hath from heaven led us to . 

As for the title of this Prince ( Who would fain be accounted the right heir ) let us but remember from whence he had it , and how it 's now tainted ; were it never so just , the treason of the father hath cut off the son ; and how unwise an act , besides all other considerations , will it be for England to set up the son to propagate both his father's design , and death . We May prophesy soon what a governor he is like to be which hath both sucked in his father's principles , and his mother's milk ; who hath been bred up under the wings of popery and episcopacy , and doubtless sucked both breasts ; one who was engaged from the beginning in the last war against this parliament , who hath the same counsellors his father had , to remember him both of the design , and the best ways of effecting it ; one who hath never yet given any testimony of hopefullness to this nation ; who was in arms when a subject , against the liberties which England and Scotland spilt much blood for to maintain ; one who hath both his fathers and his own scores to clear , and is fain to make use of all mediums , though never so contrary , attended with all the crew of malignants of three nations ; who is so relatively and personally engaged , that both old and new reckonings are expected to be paid only by him . To his father he is indebted for his crown , and bound to pay his debts , both ecclesiastical and civil ( Which will amount to no small sum ) ; to the Papists he is engaged for their old affections , and hopes of new , besides the obligation of duty to his mother , and freeing her from her monastery and hermitage . To the Prince of Orange he owes more than his ransom , besides the state's courtesies ; to Ireland he is in more arrears than his kingdom of Scotland will be able to pay , and to Scotland for his entertainment and installment more than England ( For present or in many years ) can repay without a mortgage , or community of lands , and liberties , besides what he owes England for helping his father to make the parliament spend so many million of treasure , besides blood ( Which would have weighed down all expenses besides ) and helping as a prime agent the utter destruction of England ; all which must be reckoned for with much seriousness ; and if men have so much charity and generousness to forgive all , yet we have a reckoning with heaven to be discharged , which debt is yet unpaid ( Without we think the father's blood be sufficient satisfaction to divine justice ) ; and if that death should be a satisfaction for himself , yet not for his son , who joined with him , & now continues the same fault , and guilt , and intends to follow on with more violence and intention then ever . Can we think ( & retain our memories and reasons ) that Charles the second can forget Charles the first ? that custom and education can easily be altered ? that the true and real engagers with him and his father , shall be razed out of his heart , or that he can heartily love his opposers , but as he May make use them : or that when some banks and rocks are out of the way , the waters and floods of royalty will not run in its wont channel ? will episcopacy die in England , when kingship is set up ? Can reason think or dream , that majesty will not eat out sincerity ? or that presbytery can flourish in that state where prerogative is the ascendant ? or is that person fit to be the medium of peace , and the glory of this nation , who was the conjunct instrument of the war , & the survivor both of the war and peace ? A person that durst not stay in his own nation to plead his right , because of his guilt , whose youth and wilfulness is most unapt for the settling the storms and tempests of a distracted nation . But no more until we feel the misery of such an attempt ; it was said of Tiberius Caesar in a satirical expression , yet it proved true , Regnabit sanguine multo 
Ad regnum quisquis venit ab exilio , 


Who first exiled is after crowned , 
His reign with blood will much abound . 




When this poor nation ( After all neglects of providences ) hath spent its blood and treasure to set up this Prince in the throne , ( Which it May be they shall never effect ) yet at the last they must stand to his courtesy for all their liberties , which they can never expect , and make him a monarch . The patience and long suffering of God hath permitted usurpation and tyranny in England this long time for the hardness of our hearts , and sottishness of our natures , and it May be , May lengthen it out to the utmost , which will be a misery with a witness , and yet a just punishment of God on those who were born free , but will sell away their inheritances for nothing to a stranger . Did ever King since the world began ( Setting aside some who were priests and prophets also ) naturally , and ingenuously , with a royal affection devote himself to the propagating of the pure and real liberties of the persons ? Let him be shown forth as a miracle ; but that ever any one that hath been all his days , both in the father's time , and his own engaged in wars against the liberties of the persons , ( Solemnly proclaimed in parliament ) and to set up prerogative , either intended or managed his reign that way ( How ever he was brought into his government ) i durst affirm to be a paradox , and the utmost contradiction ; i am sure it 's as impossible to be fowd in England as the philosopher's stone among the peripatecicks . but a word more to the title , between the now present power , and this Charles ; what reason is there , and equity , that the parliament of England ( Take them in what qualification you will ( Following to the utmost the first principles for the liberty of the persons ) should not be esteemed as just heirs , and their parliamentary successors as this young confident ? shall William the Norman , ( Only having a better sword ) a stranger , one who by nature was never born heir of any thing , create himself a title to Enland , and a succession for many score of years , merely on that account ? and shall every one after him break the line as they please , and take their opportunities to make themselves roots of Kings , though springing in the wilderness ? Shall Henry the seventh ( The father of us all ) who was little less than a bastard , being the son of an illegitimate son of John a Gaunt , a foreigner , and private man , by fortune and power give himself a title to this crown , and all our Kings since acknowledging right by that root ? Must those pretences be sacred which have only the ordination of a more keen and glittering sword ? and a confirmation by custom be thus divine ? and shall not the parliament of England ( Clothed with the authority of all the persons , and carrying all the liberties of England with them ) backed with the power of a faithful army , be thought ( In the utmost criticism of reason ) to have as much title to propagate their success for our freedoms , as they have had to convey both their usurpation and tyranny ? that a private claym by a better sword should be jure divino ; and a public title both by reason , success , and providence of a solemn assembly , who have been many years opposing the former oppressions , and now have gained it , should not be accounted valid , nor of equal right with a successive illegal claim ? Let all the world be judge ( Who consider the premises ) and let the violentest reason unroyalised speak its utmost . It is high time now to end that line that was never either well begun , or directly continue ; Charles the father is gone to his own place , and so is Charles the son likewise , he being in his own proper nation , Scotland ; let us keep him there if we be wise , and intend to be happy , and let England disdain to be under the domination any more of any foreign power for the future ; and seeing we have conquered the conqueror , and got the possession of the true English title , by justice , and gallantry ; let us not lose it again , by any pretence of a particular , and debauched person .
